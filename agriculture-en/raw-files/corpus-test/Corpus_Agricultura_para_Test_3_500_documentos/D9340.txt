#ITI#Morpho–physiological responses of Rocket (Eruca sativa L.) varieties to sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) stress: an experimental approach#FTI#
#IRE#Rocket (Eruca sativa L.) is a medicinal plant that belongs to the Brassicaceae family and was reported to be a tolerant plant under soil salinity as well as high genetic diversity among its varieties. Since morphological and physiological changes to sodium sulfate stress toward this plant have not been investigated yet, the present study was implemented to assess the response of rocket (Eruca sativa L.) varieties to sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) stress as well as the relationship among these traits. Two varieties of rocket plants, the Iranian and Italian ones, were subjected to four salinity (Na2SO4) treatments [0 (control), 15, 30 and 60 mM of Na2SO4 solution] and three growth stages (49, 65, and 74 days) in factorial experiment with completely randomized design and three replications were considered. Some morphologic traits such as grain yield were measured during the growth period. The results of the analysis of variances between the mentioned variables indicated a significant difference between the varieties in terms of K+, Na+, Na+/K+, leaf length, grain yield, organic and mineral matter. The results of correlation and regression of the amounts of K+ showed a linear relationship with the grain yield and its variations were not independent from the variations of grain yield. Eventually, it seems that the Italian variety was more tolerant and having better performance in comparison with the Iranian variety, in response to salt stress. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
