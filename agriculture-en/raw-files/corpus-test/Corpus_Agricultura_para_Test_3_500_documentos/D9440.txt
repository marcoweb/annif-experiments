#ITI#High day–night transition temperature alters nocturnal starch metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Transitory starch plays a vital role in maintenance respiration as its degradation products provide substrate for the night respiration. A study was conducted with two contrasting rice cultivars: Vandana (high night temperature susceptible) and Nagina 22 (high night temperature tolerant) by subjecting them to increase in transition temperature from anthesis to physiological maturity. Night respiration on plant area basis increased by 35% in Vandana at 5 days after anthesis but was unaffected in tolerant cultivar. A simultaneous 18% decrease in starch content was observed in the susceptible cultivar. An analysis of the starch-metabolizing enzymes showed that activity of β-amylase increased markedly in Vandana whereas both β and α-amylase decreased in Nagina 22 following high day to night transition temperature exposure. The level of starch breakdown product, maltose, increased in the susceptible cultivar but glucose levels declined in both the cultivars. Concurrently, expression of chloroplastic isoforms α-amylase OsAMY1, OsAMY2 and β-amylase OsBAM2 increased in Vandana. A lower accumulation of dry matter was recorded in the susceptible than the tolerant cultivar. Our study elucidated the regulatory role of transitory starch in supporting the high day to night transition temperature-induced night-time respiration which is mediated by the increased activity of β-amylase through enhanced expression of OsBAM2 in flag leaves of susceptible cultivar. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
