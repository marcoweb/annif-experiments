#ITI#Influence of anti- and prooxidants on rhizogenesis from hypocotyls of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L. cultured in vitro#FTI#
#IRE#The enrichment with antioxidants (glutathione or ascorbate) or prooxidants (alloxan, methylviologen, hydrogen peroxide) of root inducing medium significantly decreased rhizogenesis frequency (alloxan, hydrogen peroxide) or inhibited roots regeneration (ascorbate, methylviologen) during the in vitro culture of Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L. hypocotyls. The adventitious roots morphology, root hairs length and density, was also influenced. Changes in the rhizogenesis course were related to the differences in hydrogen peroxide concentration during following days of culture between explants exhibiting morphogenic potential and those without the ability to form adventitious roots. In explants with morphogenic potential, rhizogenesis induction was always accompanied by a high level of hydrogen peroxide followed by the decrease in H2O2 content in following days. In contrast, in the explants without regeneration potential, the level of hydrogen peroxide was increasing during the culture period. Activity patterns of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and guaiacol peroxidase (POX) in the following days of culture were similar in the explants exhibiting regeneration potential cultured on different media. Total activity of SOD decreased during initial days of culture and then increased due to the activation of additional SOD isoform described as MnSODII. The activity of POX was low during the rhizogenesis induction, and then increased during following days of culture; the increase was correlated with the decrease in hydrogen peroxide content. In the explants without the ability to regenerate roots, the total activity of SOD was low throughout the whole culture period, whereas the POX activity was significantly higher than in hypocotyls with regeneration potential. It might be concluded that the increase in hydrogen peroxide during initial stages of rhizogenesis and the induction of MnSODII are prerequisites for adventitious roots formation from hypocotyls of M. crystallinum, independently in the presence of anti- or prooxidant in the culture medium. © 2017, The Author(s).#FRE#
