#ITI#Distribution of tannins in the leaves of Siebold’s beech (Fagus crenata) grown under different light regimes#FTI#
#IRE#In broad-leaved trees, growth and plant defense chemicals have originated from photosynthates. Therefore, defense chemicals should be efficiently distributed in a leaf against herbivory, especially when the leaves are exposed to long-term biotic and abiotic stresses. To reveal this phenomenon, we examined the distribution of phenolic compounds, in particular tannins in the leaves of juvenile and adult Siebold’s beech (Fagus crenata Blume) under various light conditions by both chemical and histochemical analyses. The cotyledons and first true leaves of seedlings mainly included tannins in the upper and lower epidermis. By contrast, tannins were distributed in all tissues of the sun leaves of saplings (except in spongy tissue) and adult trees under higher light intensity, whereas phenolic compounds, but not tannins, were mainly present in palisade parenchyma cells and bundle sheath cells of the sun leaves of adult trees under lower light intensity. Furthermore, in adult trees, there were no changes in the distribution of phenolic compounds irrespective of the increase in the concentration of condensed tannins from June to September. These findings showed that the distribution of phenolic compounds in beech leaves changes from juvenile to adult trees and is also strongly affected by light conditions. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
