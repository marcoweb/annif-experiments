#ITI#Chromatin architecture and DNA methylation-associated epigenetic changes in ethephon-primed sprouts of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill]#FTI#
#IRE#The simplest structure phytohormone ethylene (C2H4) regulates the important aspect of plant growth and development throughout its life cycle. So far, no systemic studies were performed to determine the ethylene effect on seed germination-associated epigenetic phenomenon. Henceforth, a laboratory investigation was performed to explore the epigenetic impact of ethephon (ET) priming on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] germination. Our findings demonstrated that ET (250 ppm) induced soybean germination significantly: (1) altered the chromatin architecture; (2) reduced the global DNA methylation and 5-methylcytosine levels; (3) reduced the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) activity; (4) decreased and increased the transcript levels of DNA methylases (viz. GmMET1, GmDRM1 and GmCMT3) and demethylase (viz. GmROS1), respectively; and (5) enhanced the endogenous levels of DNMT inhibitor, genistein. Based on these observations, a novel epigenetic impact of ethylene in seed germination process has been proposed. © 2019, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
