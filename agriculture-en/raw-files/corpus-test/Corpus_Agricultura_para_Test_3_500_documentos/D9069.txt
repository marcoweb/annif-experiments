#ITI#Water deficit effects on carbon metabolism in cotton fibers during fiber elongation phase#FTI#
#IRE#The accumulation level of soluble carbohydrates in fibers during flowering may affect the final fiber length in upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). The objective of this study was to determine the relationship of carbohydrate levels and carbon metabolism enzyme activities in fibers to fiber elongation under water deficit stress. A pot study was conducted in 2013 with treatments consisting of control (well-watered) and water stress using two cotton genotypes differing in drought tolerance, namely S011 (drought sensitive) and T886 (drought tolerant). Water stress treatment was designed as withholding water from the pots until stomatal closure followed by limited water supply for 25 days where water-stressed plants received 40% of optimum quantity of water. The results showed that the glucose, fructose, sucrose and starch concentrations decreased in water-stressed fibers compared to the control. The degree of decline in hexose and total soluble sugar concentrations under water deficit stress was higher in the sensitive genotype (S011) than the tolerant genotype (T886). Similar changes were also observed in vacuolar invertase (VIN) and sucrose synthase (SuSy) activities. The reduction in hexose concentration might be due to decreased sucrose-cleaving enzyme activities especially VIN activity. The study showed that drought stress decreased VIN and SuSy activities, and hence hexose concentration in fiber cells, which resulted in a slower fiber elongation compared to the control. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
