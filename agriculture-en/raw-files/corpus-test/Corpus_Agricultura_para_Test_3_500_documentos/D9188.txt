#ITI#Correlation of genome size with cell phenotypic traits in non-edible oil crops#FTI#
#IRE#Growing modernization and industrialization have relentlessly increased the demand for energy. Lack of proper economy, deteriorating environment and ever-increasing demand of energy have paved the way for research in the field of biofuel plants; a large number of plants have been identified as suitable candidates in this regard. However, the availability of limited information on genome size proves to be a hindrance for researchers as they attempt to exploit and improve the genetic traits of significance. In this study, flow cytometric investigation has been carried out to estimate the genome size of four potential biofuel crops procured from different geographical regions of Assam. The genome size was in the order of J. curcas (0.85 pg/2C DNA) < R. communis (1 pg/2C DNA) < M. ferrea (1.4 pg/2C DNA) < P. pinnata (2.49 pg/2C DNA). Genome size is also known to affect various plant cellular characters; thus, correlation was drawn by studying cell phenotypic characters as well. Genome size was found to have an inverse relationship with epidermal cell length, guard cell length, stomatal pore size and cell volume. However, it showed a linear correlation with stomatal density. The results confirmed the correlation of genome size with cell phenotypic traits. An extensive study of genome size and their impact on the phenotypic characters of biofuel crops can open new avenues in the search a potent trait in this field. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
