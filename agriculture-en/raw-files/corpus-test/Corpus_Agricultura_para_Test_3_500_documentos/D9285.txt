#ITI#Using hydrothermal time concept to describe sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seed germination response to temperature and water potential#FTI#
#IRE#To quantify both temperature (T) and water potential (ψ) effects on sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seed germination (SG) and also to determine the cardinal Ts for this plant, a laboratory experiment was carried out using hydrothermal time model (HTT). For this purpose, four sesame cultivars (‘Asbomahalleh’, ‘Darab’, ‘Dashtestan’ and ‘Yellowhite’) were germinated at seven constant Ts (20, 25, 30, 35, 37, 39 and 43 °C) at each of the following ψs (0, − 0.12, − 0.24 and − 0.36 MPa; provided by PEG 8000). Germination rate (GR) and germination percentage (GP) significantly influenced by ψ, T and their interactions in all cultivars (P ≤ 0.01). There was no significant difference, based on the confidence intervals of the model coefficients, between cultivars, so an average of cardinal Ts was 14.7, 35.4 and 47.2 °C for the minimum (Tb), optimum (To) and maximum (Tc) Ts, respectively, in the control condition (0 MPa). Hydrotime values in all cultivars decreased when T was increased to To and then remained constant at Ts > To (15 MPa h−1). An average value of ψb(50) was estimated to be − 1.23 MPa at Ts ≤ To and then increased linearly (0.1041 MPa°Ch−1, the slope of the relationship between ψb(50) and supra-optimal Ts) with T when Ts increased above To and finally reached to zero at Tc. The Tb and To values were not influenced by ψ, but Tc value decreased (from 47.2 for zero to 43.5 °C for − 0.36 MPa) at supra-optimal Ts as a result of the effect of ψ on GR. Based on our findings, this model (as a predictive tool) and or the estimated parameter values in this study can easily be used in sesame SG simulation models to quantitatively characterize the physiological status of sesame seed populations at different Ts and ψs. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
