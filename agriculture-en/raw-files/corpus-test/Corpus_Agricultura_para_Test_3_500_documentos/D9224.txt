#ITI#The effect of tillage, fertilization and residue management on winter wheat and spring wheat physiological performance#FTI#
#IRE#This study set out to determine the effect of different fertilization systems under long-term three tillage practices in combination with crop residues or without them on spring wheat and winter wheat physiological traits. The study was carried out at the Institute of Agriculture, Lithuanian Research Centre for Agriculture and Forestry. Two treatments of residue management (returned and removed) were used. Tillage treatments: no-tillage (NT), reduced tillage (RT) and conventional tillage (CT) were used as the main plots; fertilization: without fertilizers (1), moderate rates (2) and maximum rates of NPK (3) were used as sub-plots. The measurements of chlorophyll index (SPAD) and maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) were made. The influence of factors on SPAD in winter wheat was ranked in the descending order: fertilization—tillage—residue management, and in spring wheat—fertilization—residue management—tillage. The influence of factors on Fv/ Fm in winter wheat was ranked in the descending order: fertilization—residue management—tillage, and in spring wheat—residue management—fertilization—tillage. Fertilization was the main factor explaining 17.2–43.8% and 17.1–56.8% of the total variability of SPAD values of spring and winter wheat, respectively. The influence of residue management and tillage on SPAD differed between spring and winter wheat crops. The residue returning significantly decreased SPAD and Fv/Fm of spring wheat, whereas straw significantly increased SPAD of winter wheat in most cases. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
