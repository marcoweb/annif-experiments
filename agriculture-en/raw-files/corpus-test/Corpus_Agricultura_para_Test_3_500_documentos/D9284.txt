#ITI#Growth and mineral content of coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) plants under mild salinity with different salts#FTI#
#IRE#Soil salinity is a complex issue in which various anions and cations contribute to have a general adverse effect on plant growth. In the present study, effects of salinity from various salts including sodium chloride (NaCl), potassium chloride + sodium chloride + calcium chloride (KCl + NaCl + CaCl2), potassium sulfate + magnesium nitrate (K2SO4 + Mg(NO3)2) at two electric conductivities (EC) of 2 and 4 dS m−1 of irrigation water, and a distilled water control were evaluated on coriander plants (Coriandrum sativum L.). At EC = 2, all salts increased plant yield (shoot fresh weight) than control. Most growth traits including plant height, shoot fresh and dry weight, leaf SPAD value and vitamin C, leaf K, Mg and P concentrations were increased by K2SO4 + MgNO3, and remained unchanged by KCl + NaCl + CaCl2 treatment (except reduced plant height). Leaf’s zinc concentration reduced by either treatment. Even sodium chloride at EC = 2 showed some beneficial effects on leaf chlorophyll index, root fresh weight, leaf’s calcium and phosphorus concentration; however, most traits remained unchanged than control. Treatment of plants with NaCl or KCl + NaCl + CaCl2 at either EC increased the number of flowered shoots and leaf proline content than control. Most growth and quality traits including leaf minerals and vitamin C content were reduced by NaCl at EC = 4; however, shoot fresh and dry weights remained unchanged than control. Plant root fresh weight increased by NaCl at EC = 2 and decreased at EC = 4 than control. At EC = 4, shoot dry weight was increased and leaf Ca, P, Zn and Mn were decreased by KCl + NaCl + CaCl2, whereas shoot dry weight, leaf SPAD value and vitamin C content, leaf Mg and P were increased and leaf Zn was decreased by K2SO4 + MgNO3 than control. The results indicate that in contrast to sodium chloride, the salinity effects of other salts can not be detrimental on coriander plant growth. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
