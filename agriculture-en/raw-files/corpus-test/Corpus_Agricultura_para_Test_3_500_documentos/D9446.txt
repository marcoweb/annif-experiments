#ITI#RhNAC31, a novel rose NAC transcription factor, enhances tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis#FTI#
#IRE#Key message: This work identifies a new rose NAM/CUC subgroup member, RhNAC31. Overexpression of RhNAC31 in Arabidopsis confers salt, cold, and drought tolerance along with enhanced ABA sensitivity. Abstract: Plant-specific NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC (NAC) transcription factors serve essential functions in plant development and plant responses to environmental cues. Yet, transcription factors specific to the rose (Rosa hybrida) NAM/CUC3 subfamily are poorly understood. Here, we identify a novel NAM/CUC3-subfamily transcription factor, RhNAC31, that is associated with flower opening and can be induced by increased salt, cold, and dehydration stress treatment. RhNAC31 has a transactivation region in its C-terminal region, and its overexpression is associated with enhanced cold tolerance in Arabidopsis, conferring a higher survival rate and reduced reactive oxygen (H2O2 and O2−) levels. Under salt stress conditions, plants overexpressing RhNAC31 displayed increased germination rates and lower levels of H2O2, malondiadehyde (MDA), peroxidase (POD), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Moreover, RhNAC31 conferred enhanced drought resistance by reducing the rate of water loss through leaves. Further characterization revealed a higher sensitivity of RhNAC31 transgenic plants to abscisic acid (ABA) both during and post-germination, causing lower germination and root inhibition rates under ABA treatment. Quantitative PCR experiments showed that numerous abiotic stress-related genes were activated by RhNAC31 overexpression. Our results highlight RhNAC31 as a positive transcriptional regulator of tolerance to multiple abiotic pressures, and we conclude that RhNAC31 has potential for use in the molecular breeding of stress-tolerant crops. © 2019, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
