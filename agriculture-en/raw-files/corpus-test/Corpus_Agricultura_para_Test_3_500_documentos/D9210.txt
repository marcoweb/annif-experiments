#ITI#Differential accumulation of proteins in leaves and roots associated with heat tolerance in two Kentucky bluegrass genotypes differing in heat tolerance#FTI#
#IRE#To understand the mechanisms of heat stress responses in perennial grasses, differential proteins in leaves and roots of two genotypes of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), including heat-tolerant ‘Midnight’ and heat-sensitive ‘Brilliant’, were analyzed with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS). Plants were exposed to heat stress for 28 days in growth chambers. Under 7–28 days of heat stress, leaf photochemical efficiency declined significantly while electrolyte leakage increased in leaves and roots, and to a lesser extent for heat-tolerant ‘Midnight’ than for heat-sensitive ‘Brilliant’. Compared with leaves, cell membrane damage due to heat stress was more severe in roots. The 2-DE and MS analysis identified 37 heat-responsive proteins in leaves, 28 heat-responsive proteins in roots; 14 proteins in leaves and 9 proteins in roots exhibited differential expression between the two genotypes. The results indicate that proteins involved in metabolism and energy in leaves and those in antioxidant defense in roots are associated with heat tolerance in Kentucky bluegrass. The differential accumulation of these proteins might be the reason for different heat tolerance in two Kentucky bluegrass genotypes in aerial and underground parts. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
