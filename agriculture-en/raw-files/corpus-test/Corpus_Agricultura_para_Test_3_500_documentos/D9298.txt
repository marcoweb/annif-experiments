#ITI#The control over physiological dormancy break by gibberellins in Calibrachoa sellowiana (Sendtn.) Wijsman seeds are associated with polyamines#FTI#
#IRE#Calibrachoa sellowiana (Sendtn.) Wijsman is a wild relative’s crop of ornamental Solanaceae that could give us a broader spectrum of physiological behaviours about the control of the seed germination process. In this study, we investigated the physiological relationship between gibberellins and polyamines on germination and identify the physiological quality of C. sellowiana seeds. Ripe seeds were collected from natural habitats followed by morphostructural, physiological and polyamine analyses. We found out structural differences between seeds with two seed coat colours. Dark seeds showed a full developed seed coat, intact embryo and endosperm. In contrast, pale seeds presented an undeveloped seed coat, a stunted embryo and a retracted endosperm, indicating a high correlation between seed coat colour and viability. Furthermore, exogenous gibberellins and temperature switching were associated with the germination of dark seeds. Moreover, polyamines’ content, especially Spd and Put were remarkably enhanced during the radicle protrusion of these seeds, but only after the application of gibberellins to break the physiological seed dormancy. Our results indicated a strong cause and effect relationship between germination and polyamines content, specifically at phase III of seed germination. These results address a new physiological question as well as establish the groundwork of seed germination toward improving ornamental crops of this species. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
