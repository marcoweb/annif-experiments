#ITI#Analysis of the impact of heat on new camellias using nondestructive methods#FTI#
#IRE#Cluster-flowering camellias are among the most promising types of camellia due to both their ornamental characteristics and their resistance capacity, especially to heat and alkaline soils. Because of global climate change, researchers at the Shanghai Botanical Garden are attempting to identify more heat tolerant plants; camellia is such a plant, and it has been promoted for more than 20 years. Morphological and physiological approaches were used in this study to evaluate the heat tolerance of two new cultivars, and new methods were also explored. The results indicate that the heat tolerance of the new cultivar Camellia hybrid ‘Pink Cascade’ is higher than that of Camellia hybrid ‘Sweet Gem’. In addition, infrared thermography can further be used to evaluate the heat resistance of plants in combination with their stomatal and photosynthetic characteristics. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
