#ITI#Spontaneous action potentials and circumnutation in Helianthus annuus#FTI#
#IRE#Action potentials (APs) in plants are involved in fast leaf or trap closure as well as elongation, respiration, photosynthesis, and fertilization regulation. Here, spontaneous APs (SAPs) in relation to endogenous stem movement named circumnutation (CN) have been investigated in Helianthus annuus in different light conditions in freely circumnutating and immobilized plants. Extracellular electrical measurements and time-lapse photography were carried out simultaneously. The parameters of CN (trajectory length, period, and direction) and the number and transmission direction of SAPs were analysed. In continuous light (25–40 μmol m−2 s−1), all plants circumnutating vigorously in a regular elliptical manner and no SAPs were observed. In light/dark conditions, the plants circumnutated in a daily pattern, most SAPs were observed in the dark and freely circumnutated sunflowers had two times more SAPs (10 SAPs/24 h/plant) than the immobilized plants (5 SAPs/24 h/plant). In continuous very low light (5 μmol m−2 s−1), the plants circumnutated weakly and irregularly and SAPs appeared without the circadian pattern. 3–5 SAPs/24/plant occurred in the freely circumnutating and immobilized plants. In light/dark and continuous very low light conditions, an ultradian rhythm of SAPs was observed and the mean spacing between SAPs was approx. 121–271 min in the freely circumnutating and immobilized plants. Under all light conditions, more SAPs were transmitted basipetally than acropetally. One-hour lasting series of 3–4 min spaced SAPs locally propagated were observed as well in very low light. Basipetal and acropetal SAPs passing along the stem motor region accompany irregularity, changes in the CN trajectory direction, and stem torsion. These results demonstrate that APs and CN changes play a role in plant adaptation to light conditions and that there is an ultradian rhythm of SAPs beside ultradian CN rhythm. © 2017, The Author(s).#FRE#
