#ITI#Comparative analysis of the structure, suberin and wax composition and key gene expression in the epidermis of ‘Dangshansuli’ pear and its russet mutant#FTI#
#IRE#Mature fruit of ‘Dangshansuli’ pear has yellow-green skin, while its mutant ‘Xiusu’ has russet fruit skin, which is a genetic variation. To explore the mechanism underlying the russet formation, the fruit spot and epidermal structure were observed, the color, texture, and wax and suberin components were evaluated, and the gene expression levels were confirmed. In the present study, the color, texture and fruit spot of the epidermis differed significantly between ‘Dangshansuli’ and ‘Xiusu’ at 25 days after full bloom (DAFB). The cuticular wax components were alkanes, olefins, alkanoic acids, alcohols and terpenes, and the suberin was composed of fatty acid, α,ω-diacids, ω-hydroxy fatty acids, mainly ferulic acid and primary alcohols in the epidermis of ‘Dangshansuli’ and ‘Xiusu’, which exhibited significant differences at most stages of the development of pear fruits. Moreover, the expression levels of genes involved in wax and suberin were consistent with morphological and biochemical analyses. The results indicated that the suberization of epidermal cells occurred when pear fruit was young and that wax and suberin might contribute to the russet formation on the epidermis of ‘Xiusu’, leading to the significant differences in color, texture, fruit spot, and exocarp structure between ‘Dangshansuli’ and ‘Xiusu’ pears. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
