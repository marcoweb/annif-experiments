#ITI#Induction of two cyclotide-like genes Zmcyc1 and Zmcyc5 by abiotic and biotic stresses in Zea mays#FTI#
#IRE#Cyclotides are small plant disulfide-rich and cyclic proteins with a diverse range of biological activities. Cyclotide-like genes show key sequence features of cyclotides and are present in the Poaceae. In this study the cDNA of the nine cyclotide-like genes were cloned and sequenced using 3′RACE from Zea mays. The gene expression of two of these genes (Zmcyc1 and Zmcyc5) were analyzed by real-time PCR in response to biotic (Fusarium graminearum, Ustilago maydis and Rhopalosiphum maydis) and abiotic (mechanical wounding, water deficit and salinity) stresses, as well as in response to salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate elicitors to mimic biotic stresses. All isolated genes showed significant similarity to other cyclotide-like genes and were classified in two separate clusters. Both Zmcyc1 and Zmcyc5 were expressed in all studied tissues with the highest expression in leaves and lowest expression in roots. Wounding, methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid significantly induced the expression of Zmcyc1 and Zmcyc5 genes, but the higher expression was observed for Zmcyc1 as compared with Zmcyc5. Expression levels of these two genes were also induced in inoculated leaves with F. graminearum, U. maydis and also in response to insect infestation. In addition, the 1000-base-pairs (bp) upstream of the promoter of Zmcyc1 and Zmcyc5 genes were identified and analyzed using the PlantCARE database and consequently a large number of similar biotic and abiotic cis-regulatory elements were identified for these two genes. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
