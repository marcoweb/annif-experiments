#ITI#Analysis of intra-specific variability of cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) in response to temperature during germination#FTI#
#IRE#Key message: Cocksfoot shows intra-specific variability in its response to constant temperature during germination. Abstract: Temperature, in conjunction with other environmental factors, controls plant development, including seed germination and its timing, which directly affects seedling survival. Indirectly, seed germination affects recruitment of individuals and hence the genetic dynamics of grasslands communities. Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) is a major species growing in temperate and Mediterranean grasslands. Six accessions of D. glomerata, including four natural populations and two commercial varieties were evaluated for their responses to eight constant temperatures, from 5 to 40 ℃, with increases by 5 ℃. Four replicates of one-hundred seeds per accession were put in the dark and counted for germination at variable frequencies and duration that depended on temperature treatments. We estimated maximum germination percentage, maximum germination rate as well as apparent initial time and time when 50% of seed germinate. The F test showed significant difference (P < 0.01) between the response curves of various accessions. At least four types of responses can be distinguished. Temperature for maximum germination ranged from 5 to 25 ℃, depending on accessions. The results of this study reveal the existence of intraspecific genetic variability during germination in D. glomerata for the response to temperature. Such variability could be used to select new varieties adapted to thermal conditions induced by ongoing climate change. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
