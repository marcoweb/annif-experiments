#ITI#Comparative growth, peroxidase activity and 2-D proteome analyses of halophytic and xerophytic species of Haloxylon under NaCl stress#FTI#
#IRE#Differential NaCl tolerance efficiency of salt-tolerant Haloxylon recurvum and drought-tolerant Haloxylon salicornicum was investigated in the present study. The analyses were based on growth, peroxidase activity and 2-D protein profiling of 0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 mM NaCl treated cotyledonary nodes and shoots of both the species. NaCl promoted the growth of cotyledonary nodes of H. recurvum up to 100 mM but found to be inhibitory for H. salicornicum. Total soluble protein was increased up to 100 mM NaCl in H. recurvum but decreased in H. salicornicum. Nine out of 14 (64.28%) protein spots of Group I (99.6–36.9 kDa) and 3 out of 14 (21.42%) protein spots of Group III (26.3–22.4 kDa) were up-regulated and 2 protein spots (14.28%) of Group II (33.0–29.7 kDa), were down-regulated in H. recurvum. Six out of 8 (75%) protein spots of Group I (60.6–33.1 kDa) were down regulated, and 2 out of 8 spots of Group II (30.6–25.1 kDa) were up-regulated under NaCl stress in H. salicornicum. A comparatively higher number of differentially abundant relative protein spots up regulation conferred NaCl tolerance up to 100 mM in H. recurvum in the present investigation. Comparatively higher peroxidase activity was observed in H. salicornicum under NaCl stress than H. recurvum.The findings of the present investigation will provide the basis for the molecular biology of salt and drought tolerance mechanisms of haloxerophytes for prospects. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
