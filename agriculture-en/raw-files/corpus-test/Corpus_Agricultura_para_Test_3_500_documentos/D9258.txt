#ITI#Heat stress induces actin cytoskeletal reorganization and transcript profiles of vegetative profilins and actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs) in Arabidopsis#FTI#
#IRE#In the present study, the qRT-PCR results showed that the vegetative profilins and actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs) were specifically induced by heat stress and different isoform showed different expression pattern. Both of these ABPs play prominent roles in modulating the dynamics of microfilaments (MFs). So we observed the MFs of Arabidopsis seedlings treated with heat stress (37 °C for 24 h; 45 °C for 45 min). Mild heat stress (37 °C) triggered the MF cytoskeletal reorganization and rough heat stress (45 °C) induced the MFs depolymerization. In addition, the resistance of Arabidopsis seedlings to temperature stresses increased following treatment with phalloidin, whereas their resistance was decreased when latrunculin B was applied. Thus, our results show that specific members of the vegetative profilins and ADFs might respond to heat stress, and the MF cytoskeleton has an important role in response to heat stress in Arabidopsis seedlings. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
