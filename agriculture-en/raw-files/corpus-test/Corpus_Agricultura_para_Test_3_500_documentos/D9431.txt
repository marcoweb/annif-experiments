#ITI#Ectopic overexpression of cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase gene (Apx1) improves salinity stress tolerance in Brassica juncea by strengthening antioxidative defense mechanism#FTI#
#IRE#Salinity stress is considered to be a key constrain that reduces the crop productivity by impairing plant growth and development. During salt stress condition, an underlying mechanism for reduction in crop yield is increase in ROS level that can potentially harm cellular macromolecules, leading to disruption of essential physiological and biochemical processes. Plants possess a complex antioxidative defense machinery for scavenging these ROS. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX, E.C. 1.11.1.11), is a crucial antioxidant enzyme involved in Ascorbate–Glutathione pathway that primarily detoxifies the negative impact of H2O2 in cell. The efficient scavenging of H2O2 is a prerequisite for enhanced tolerance to salinity stress. Here, we have inspected whether over-expression of APX could provide protection against salinity stress. Cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (Apx1) gene, isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana, was chosen as the candidate gene for strengthening the antioxidative defense system of Brassica juncea. Physiological parameters were employed to analyze the growth status of transgenic plants. Leaf disc assay was done to evaluate the salinity stress tolerance potential of transgenic plants, using several physiological and biochemical parameters. Under salinity stress, the transgenic plants performed well as compared to their non-transgenic counterparts; as revealed through greater proline accumulation, increased chlorophyll stability index, lower chlorophyll a/b ratio, and higher antioxidative enzyme activities. Further, the lower H2O2 levels were well correlated with lesser membrane damage as measured through MDA content. Collectively, our results clearly depicted that ectopic overexpression of AtApx1 gene was able to confer salinity stress tolerance by strengthening the antioxidative defense system in B. juncea. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
