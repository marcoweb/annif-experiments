#ITI#The influence of silicon application on growth and photosynthesis response of salt stressed grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.)#FTI#
#IRE#The influences of silicon (Si) on parameters, such as plant growth, pigment contents, photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, soluble sugar and starch concentration, and some cell ultra-structures, were investigated in grapevines under salt stress. Compared with the control, the treatment with 100 mM NaCl dramatically inhibited the growth of grapevines and greatly decreased the content of pigments. Silicon treatment in the absence of salt had negative effects in most observed parameters. However, the addition of Si under salt stress improved all growth parameters and increased the pigments and photosynthetic rates compared with the NaCl treatment. Furthermore, investigation of chlorophyll fluorescence, soluble sugars, starch concentration and cell ultra-structure indicated that photosynthesis in the NaCl treatment decreased. The supplement of silicon mitigated the inhibited photosynthesis caused by NaCl, and increased the maximum yield and potential photochemical efficiency of the photochemical reactions in photosystem II. On the other hand, the addition of exogenous Si and NaCl also increased the concentration of soluble sugars and starch, and influenced ultra-structural changes. It is possible that silicon might play an important role in protecting photosynthetic machinery from damage and improving the salt-tolerance of the grape by increasing the concentration of soluble sugars and starch. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
