#ITI#Global histone H3 hyperacetylation-associated epigenetic changes induced in ethephon-primed sprouts of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill]#FTI#
#IRE#The concept of plant growth regulators (PGRs) in modulating the plant physiological processes through epigenetic modification(s) is emerging. The present work aims to elucidate the histone (de)acetylation-associated epigenetic changes in ethylene (ET)-primed sprouts of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill]. Our results demonstrated that ethephon (donor source of ET) priming (ETp) in soybean significantly enhanced the: (1) germination rate, (2) global histone H3 (H3ac) and H3 lysine 9 (H3K9ac) acetylation levels, (3) histone acetyltransferases activity (concomitant with reduced histone deacetylases activity), (4) cellular acetyl-CoA pool and (5) global de novo RNA synthesis. As a gene-specific case study, ETp resulted in relative reduced starch content, concomitant with an enhanced mRNA accumulation, transcriptional rate and proximal promoter H3K9ac levels of α-amylase 1 (GmαAMY1). Taken together, the proposed epigenetic role of ET as a ‘histone-code’ modulator in soybean sprouts could provide a novel insight on PGR-induced epigenetic re-programming and signifies a broader scope for future epigenetic studies in other agronomical important crops. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
