#ITI#Trichoderma lixii ID11D seed biopriming mitigates dose dependent salt toxicity in maize#FTI#
#IRE#Certain number of commercial products has been developed to grow stress resistant plants for the sustainability of agriculture in current era with full of energy dependency and hunger besides global warming. Given the risk of these products on the microbial environment in the rhizosphere and food security of mankind due to the accumulated chemical pollution through the food web, organic fungal plant growth promoting agents might be used. Hence, effects of Trichoderma lixii ID11D (TXD), our local fungal isolate on Zea mays L. cv. Samada 07 as a seed biopriming agent was investigated under dose dependent NaCl stress in this study. Fungus was characterized based on ITS (internal transcribed spacer) regions via clustering approach after isolated from tea plantation area. The higher the NaCl concentration, the more effective the TXD was observed. Improved electron transport rate (ETR), maximum quantum efficiency of PS II (Fv/Fm), the effective quantum yield of PS2 (ΦPS2), photochemical quenching (qP) and decreased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was detected in TXD primed plants after NaCl expose. TXD seed biopriming increased the lengths, fresh and dry weights of root/shoots and decreased the lipid peroxidation (MDA) remarkably. Non-enzymatic pathway was found to be more effective than enzymatic one for seed bioprimed plants proven by higher RWC, soluble protein, proline, chlorophyll, carotenoid, and less H2O2 and MDA levels under each dose of NaCl. Detected phenotypic and biochemical improvements pave the way of the potential usage of the formulated fungus biopreperations as a pre-harvest agent in agriculturally important cereals in the future and going beyond lab-based level. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
