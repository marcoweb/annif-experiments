#ITI#Metabolic response of cornflower (Centaurea cyanus L.) exposed to tribenuron-methyl: one of the active substances of sulfonylurea herbicides#FTI#
#IRE#Tribenuron-methyl is the active substance of the herbicide used for weed control in crops. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in the metabolic response of seeds, seedlings and leaves of Centaurea cyanus L., depending on the degree of resistance to tribenuron-methyl. Changes in the values of selected biochemical and physiological parameters (germination index, chemical composition, photochemical efficiency of photosystem II and the emission spectra of blue-green fluorescence) presented herein make it possible to determine the differences between cornflower biotypes with various types of resistance to the tested herbicide. Moreover, differences in the chemical composition of dry seeds between biotypes susceptible and resistant to tribenuron-methyl were observed before using the herbicide. The degree of resistance to the herbicide—resistant or susceptible, but not the types of this resistance-mutational or metabolic, can be distinguished on the basis of the presented parameters. These findings allow for early diagnosis of the resistance of cornflower to tribenuron-methyl. Additionally, we suggest that the described parameters might be used as physiochemical markers for early estimation of weed resistance to various types of herbicide. The presented conclusions are especially important for agricultural practice. © 2016, The Author(s).#FRE#
