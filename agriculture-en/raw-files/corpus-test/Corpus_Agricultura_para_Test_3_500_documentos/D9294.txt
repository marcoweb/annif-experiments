#ITI#The relationship between antioxidant compounds contents and antioxidant enzymes under water-deficit stress in the three Iranian cultivars of basil (Ocimum basilicum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#The current investigation was conducted to elucidate the potential modulatory functions of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic scavenging elements of three Iranian basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) cultivars in response to different water-deficit stress treatments [i.e., control (W1: 100 % FC), mild (W2: 75 % FC), moderate (W3: 50 % FC), and severe (W4: 25 % FC)]. In general, the growth parameters, viz., plant height, number of lateral branches, number of flowers in the inflorescence per plant, and dry and fresh weights of leaves and inflorescence followed by yield were considerably affected by water-deficit stress levels (p ≤ 0.05), though some fluctuations were observed among three cultivars. Under severe water-deficit stress (W4), total chlorophyll content overall increased, while a pronounced reduction in the carotenoid content was observed by boosting of water-deficit stress intensities. Apart from some quantitative variations, ROS-scavenging enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, APX, GPX, and PPO, exhibited different behaviors versus different levels of water-deficit stress in the basil cultivars, concluding that their modulation could be a cultivar-dependent mechanism and stress-dependent mechanism. Among different metabolites detected in the essential oil of basil cultivars, both methyl chavicol and squalene were superior in the cultivars 2 and 3, while in cultivar 1, linalool and squalene were the predominant constituents, under water deprivation conditions. Taking all the features studied here into consideration, presumably, cultivar 1 is qualified enough to nominate as the most tolerant basil cultivar, could be accordingly utilized as a promising source/material for breeding programs of basil under drought stress, and possibly other abiotic stresses. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
