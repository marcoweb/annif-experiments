#ITI#Impact of exogenously applied tocopherol on some key physio-biochemical and yield attributes in mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] under limited irrigation regimes#FTI#
#IRE#The lipophilic vitamin E, α-Tocopherol (α-Toc), has been considered as a potent cellular antioxidant naturally occurring in biological membranes. It plays a number of key metabolic roles in plants exposed to various stressful cues. A field experimental was conducted on mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] under varying water-limited regimes and the plants were sprayed with four levels of α-Toc (0, 100, 200, and 300 mg L−1) at the vegetative stage of plant growth. The results showed that limited field irrigation regimes (desiccated conditions) caused a marked reduction in growth parameters (shoot and root fresh and dry weights; shoot and root lengths), photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b), total soluble proteins (TSP) and yield attributes (number of pods, seeds per plant, weight of ripened pods and 100-seeds weight), while, in contrast, water deficiency induced an increase in phenolics, proline, glycine betaine (GB), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), reducing and non-reducing sugars, total free amino acids, endogenous tocopherol levels, and activities of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT). However, the foliar spray of α-Toc significantly improved shoot and root fresh and dry weights, shoot and root lengths, chlorophyll a and b contents, phenolics, proline, GB, reducing and non-reducing sugars, TSP, total free amino acids, endogenous tocopherol level, and activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, and CAT), as well as yield parameters. On the other hand, it significantly decreased the MDA and H2O2 levels. Of all varying levels of α-Toc used, 100 mg L−1 was most effective in causing enhanced accumulation of ascorbic acid (AsA), MDA, and cellular tocopherols particularly in cv. Cyclone 7008, while proline and catalase in cv. Cyclone 8009. Of both cultivars, Cyclone 7008 was superior to the other cultivar in proline, TSP, SOD, and POD enzymes, but cv. Cyclone 8009 being superior in shoot fresh weights, root fresh weight, shoot and root lengths, chlorophyll a and b, phenolics, H2O2, AsA, MDA, CAT, number of pods, seeds, weight of ripened pods, and weight of 100 seeds under dry land conditions. Overall, exogenously applied tocopherol improved yield and myriad of key physio-biochemical attribute in mungbean. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
