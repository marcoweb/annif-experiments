#ITI#Trace elements’ uptake and antioxidant response to excess of manganese in in vitro cells of sensitive and tolerant wheat#FTI#
#IRE#Manganese, a microelement important for plant metabolism, when accumulated at higher doses, may act as a stress factor. Such action of this element is not fully recognized and is currently being intensively studied. The influence of manganese, at high (1, 2 and 3 mM) concentrations, on the induction of oxidative stress in wheat cells was studied under in vitro conditions. Calli of two wheat cultivars, different in terms of stress tolerance, were cultured for 7 days on Murashige–Skoog media with or without auxin (2,4-D) and with additional Mn supplementation. Changes of malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and the activity of enzymes (SOD, CAT and POX) involved in oxidative response as well as the accumulation of Mn and elements essential for plant development (Mn, Mg, S, Ca, K, P, Na, Zn, Mo, Cu, Fe) were detected. Moreover, proline and carbohydrate contents were determined to check the induction of osmotic stress. An increase of lipid peroxidation (expressed by MDA content), induced by ROS generation, was smaller in the tolerant (‘Parabola’) cultivar than in the sensitive one (‘Raweta’). The activation of antioxidative enzymes was more effective in the cells of tolerant wheat, where a lower quantity of Mn was accumulated. Mn uptake was correlated with a decrease of an amount of almost all the investigated elements. Auxin presence in the culture media accelerated the stressogenic effect of Mn. © 2016, The Author(s).#FRE#
