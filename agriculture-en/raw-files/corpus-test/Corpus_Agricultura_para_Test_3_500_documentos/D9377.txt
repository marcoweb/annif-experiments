#ITI#Effect of genotype, induction medium, carbohydrate source, and polyethylene glycol on embryogenesis in maize (Zea mays L.) anther culture#FTI#
#IRE#This study conducted two experiments involving in vitro anther culture of Zea mays L. The first experiment tested 46 maize genotypes, including inbred lines, single and three-way cross hybrids, and line A188 as control, in three different induction basal media (IMSS, N6 and YPm) for their androgenic responses. The results showed that the embryos were established 2–3 weeks after the anthers of the few responsive genotypes were cultured. Most responsive genotypes produced embryos in at least one of the three basal media; therefore, genotype is more important than the type of medium for androgenesis in maize. The mean number of anthers that developed to embryo ranged from 19 embryos per Petri dish in YPm medium for the cross (DH5 × DH7) genotype to 0 for some maize genotypes. In the second experiment, this research reports for the first time the effect of carbohydrates and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a non-metabolized osmoticum on the embryogenesis anther culture of maize. The genotype DH5 × DH7 was used for this experiment, and the media were varied by altering sucrose, maltose, and PEG concentrations. Results showed that the maximum embryogenesis (32 embryos per Petri dish) was obtained by YPm basal medium supplemented with 60 gl−1 sucrose + 0.0125 M PEG and 30 gl−1 sucrose + 30 gl−1 maltose + 0.0125 M PEG. The lowest rate of embryogenesis was observed in YPm basal medium with 60 gl−1 maltose and 0.0125 or 0.025 M PEG. Sucrose or a high concentration of maltose was found to be necessary for embryogenesis in anther culture of maize. Therefore, the addition of low levels of PEG and/or different sugars in the experimental design appeared to improve the protocol currently available in the world, especially for anther embryo yield and haploid plant regeneration in maize. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
