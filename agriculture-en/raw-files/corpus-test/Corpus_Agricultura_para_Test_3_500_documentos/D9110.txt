#ITI#Ectopic expression of PvSOC1, a homolog of SOC1 from Phyllostachys violascens, promotes flowering in Arabidopsis and rice#FTI#
#IRE#MADS-box protein SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1) plays an important role in the regulation of flowering by integrating multiple flowering signals in Arabidopsis thaliana. SOC1-like genes have been isolated from many plants and their functions received wide attention. To investigate SOC1 homologs in bamboo, a SOC1 homolog, referred to as PvSOC1, was isolated from Phyllostachys violascens, and characterized. PvSOC1 encoded a protein of 226 amino acids containing a highly conserved SOC1 motif. PvSOC1 transcript was expressed in all examined tissues but preferentially in leaves. Ectopic expression of PvSOC1 in both Arabidopsis and rice caused early flowering, abnormal floral organs and leaves. A P-box, the gibberellin response element existed in the promoter region of PvSOC1 but not in that of SOC1 and OsSOC1. Upon gibberellic acid treatment, PvSOC1 transcript was upregulated in the leaves of Ph. violascens seedlings, suggesting a positive response to gibberellin acid. Thus, our experiments suggest PvSOC1 to be a multifunctional gene, which not only regulates flowering, but also affects leaf development. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
