#ITI#Effects of alkali stress on dry matter accumulation, root morphology, ion balance, free polyamines, and organic acids of sugar beet#FTI#
#IRE#Sugar beet is strongly resistant to salt-alkalinity. Understanding the physiological alkali stress resistance mechanism of sugar beet is important for fully utilizing saline–alkaline soil. Sugar beet seedlings from cultivars KWS0143 (alkali-tolerant) and Beta464 (alkali-sensitive) were treated with five concentrations of mixed alkaline solutions (NaHCO3: Na2CO3, 2:1), namely, 0 (control), 25, 50, 75, and 100 mM (mole concentration was calculated in Na+). A sharper decrease in dry weight per plant (87.1%) and total root length (91.7%) of Beta464 were observed compared to the 61.5% and 85.0% decrease in those of KWS0143 under 100 mM alkali treatment. With increasing alkaline stress, Na+ accumulation hindered K+ and Ca2+ absorption by roots. Free polyamines contents and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activity in roots of both cultivars were all significantly enhanced by 50 and 75 mM alkali treatments. KWS0143 exhibited higher dissociated putrescine (Put), spermine (Spm), as well as spermidine (Spd) levels within the roots compared to Beta464 under alkali conditions. Root free Spd contents of KWS0143 and Beta464 increased by 154.2 and 64.5% treated with 50 mM alkali in comparison with the control. After treated with the dose of 25 mM, root succinic acid (SA) contents of KWS0143 and Beta464 increased by 90.4 and 14.3%, respectively, compared to the plants subjected to the control. Our results imply that polyamines and PEPC contribute to the tolerance of sugar beet to alkali stress. Those results could be useful for enriching the theory of plant stress response. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
