#ITI#Disruption of IQM5 delays flowering possibly through modulating the juvenile-to-adult transition#FTI#
#IRE#IQ motif-containing protein 5 (IQM5) is the fifth member of the IQM family in Arabidopsis, which is an IQ motif-containing family. However, no functional characterizations have been performed using the IQM5 protein in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we showed that the IQM5 gene is involved in the regulation of flowering in Arabidopsis. The IQM5 mutants iqm5-1 and iqm5-2 displayed a later-flowering phenotype under both long-day and short-day conditions when compared with wild type. After gibberellic acid or paclobutrazol (PAC) treatments, iqm5-1 and iqm5-2 displayed similar flowering phenotype or PAC sensitivity to wild type. Meanwhile, iqm5-1 and iqm5-2 showed the same flowering ratio as wild type after a vernalization treatment. In addition, disrupting IQM5 increased the transcript level of FLOWERING LOCUS C in both shoot apical meristems and leaves, and decreased that of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15 in leaves, but did not change the expression of other key genes in the flowering time-related pathway. In addition, the number of abaxial trichomes in both iqm5-1 and iqm5-2 is lower than that in the wild type. Thus, disruption of IQM5 delays flowering possibly through modulating the juvenile-to-adult transition. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
