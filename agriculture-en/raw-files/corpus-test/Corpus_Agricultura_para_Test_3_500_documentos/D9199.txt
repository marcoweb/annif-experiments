#ITI#Phosphate efflux rates from roots of Trifolium uniflorum, Trifolium repens and some T. repens × T. uniflorum interspecific hybrids#FTI#
#IRE#Phosphate efflux rates from root systems were measured on hydroponically grown plants of Trifolium uniflorum, white clover (T. repens), and six interspecific T. repens × T. uniflorum hybrids that had been backcrossed to white clover. Efflux of phosphate was measurable for every clover type. There were only minor differences among the clover types for phosphate efflux g−1 root dry weight. Less than 0.6 % of root phosphorus was lost over a 4-h assay. It was concluded that selection for variation in phosphate efflux rates is not likely to contribute significantly to improving the phosphate efficiency of white clover. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
