#ITI#Leaf senescence of winter wheat and spring wheat as influenced by tillage and fertilization management#FTI#
#IRE#There is still a lack of knowledge about the physiological traits of wheat as affected by tillage and NPK fertilizer management. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different fertilization strategies under two tillage practices on leaf senescence of spring wheat and winter wheat. The experiment consisted of two tillage treatments (NT: no-tillage and CT: conventional tillage) and three fertilization treatments (1—without fertilizers, 2—moderate rates, 3—maximum rates of NPK). The measurements of chlorophyll index (SPAD) and maximum quantum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) were used to evaluate the leaf senescence. The analysis of variance showed that growth stage and fertilization had significant (P ≤ 0.01) effect on leaf senescence of both spring wheat and winter wheat, whereas tillage significantly influenced senescence indicators only in winter wheat. In spring wheat, NT resulted in faster senescence of leaves. In winter wheat, senescence proceeded in a dissimilar pattern than in spring wheat, NT allowed green pigment to be retained in winter wheat leaves, whereas SPAD intensively declined in CT. Fertilization delayed senescence in both spring wheat and winter wheat. These results demonstrated the relationship between senescence duration and grain yield. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
