#ITI#Effect of biosorption of Fe2+ by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa YMM19 on the physiology of Lupinus albus, Triticum aestivum, Vicia faba, and Zea mays seedlings#FTI#
#IRE#The goal of this study was to look into growth changes and a number of metabolic events in Fe2+ treated Lupinus albus, Triticum aestivum, Vicia faba, and Zea mays plants and assess the role of biosorption of Fe2+ by Rhodotorula mucilaginosa YMM19 to alleviate these changes. The effect of Fe2+ concentrations (untreated and treated with biosorbent) on seed germination was studied. T. aestivum plumule was stimulated with a low dose of Fe2+. However, the application of Fe2+ reduced the elongation of plumule, and radicle of all seeds during germination. High doses of Fe2+ treated with biosorbent significantly increased seedling weights (fresh and dry) of all plants. Also, after 20 days, the height, and weight of seedlings of L. albus, T. aestivum, and Z. mays were increased with biosorbed Fe2+ solution. In addition, biosorption of Fe2+ enhanced total carbohydrate and protein accumulation in both T. aestivum and Z. mays radicles. Moreover, Fe2+ caused slight suppression of α- and β-amylase in L. albus and Z. mays seeds after 2 days, but the opposite effect was observed in T. aestivum. Thus, the biosorption by R. mucilaginosa YMM19 is an efficient system for removing the negative effect of excess Fe2+ from water. © 2022, The Author(s).#FRE#
