#ITI#Drought response in winter wheat: protection from oxidative stress and mutagenesis effect#FTI#
#IRE#Radiation mutagenesis could provide new drought-tolerant lines for selection purposes in sustainable agriculture. Drought tolerance and yield stability are closely related to coping with oxidative stress, which occurs at severe/prolonged water deprivation. In this study, the response of a newly generated winter wheat mutant line M181/1338K to severe drought stress at seedling stage (3–4th leaf) was compared to that of two established varieties—Guinness (drought tolerant) and Farmer (drought sensitive). Oxidative damage and antioxidant status analyses were performed on second leaves of control, stressed (45–46% leaf water deficit) and recovered plants. Genotypes exhibited similar pattern of stress response, comprising proline accumulation, rise in hydrogen peroxide content and oxidative damage to membrane lipids, increase in total antioxidant and antiradical activities, in phenolic and flavonoid content, in ascorbate and glutathione pools, mobilization of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX) enzyme isoforms. Farmer responded to severe water stress with the highest levels of oxidative damage to membranes, proline accumulation, and glutathione content, and slower normalization of the studied parameters upon recovery. Guinness presented a better control of oxidative membrane damage and it the highest accumulation of flavonoids under drought. The new mutant line M181/1338K had similarities with Guinness in its response to severe water stress, such as the same proline and glutathione levels. Unlike Guinness, the mutant genotype had more pronounced oxidative damage to membranes, along with higher POX activities, and tended to accumulate less flavonoids under drought, which could be regarded as secondary effects of the induced mutagenesis. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
