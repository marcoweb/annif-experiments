#ITI#Identification, evolution and expression analyses of Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit gene family in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) serves as a plentiful leaf protein which functions in both eukaryote and prokaryote photosynthesis. The small subunits of Rubisco (RBCS) exist as a multigene family which regulates the catalytic efficiency of holoenzyme. Here, 20 RBCS family genes were identified in Triticum aestivum genome, and were clustered into 4 clades according to phylogenetic analysis. On the basis of the identified 9 and 8 RBCSs in Triticum urartu and Aegilops tauschii, homology analysis revealed some TaRBCS genes were orthologous to TuRBCSs and AetRBCSs, and the number of in-paralog pairs between RBCSs in wheat were much more than that in T. urartu or A. tauschii. Gene structure, protein motif and cis-acting element analysis exhibited that TaRBCSs in each clade shared some identity. The in silico expression of RBCS genes showed that RBCSs mainly expressed in leaf, flower and caryopsis. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that TaRBCSs were remarkably responsive to drought, salt, ABA and darkness stresses. The work comprehensively studies the RBCS family genes in wheat, and lays the foundation for subsequent functional research of TaRBCSs. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
