#ITI#Cellular oxidative damage and impairment on the photosynthetic apparatus caused by Asian Soybean Rust on soybeans are alleviated by nickel#FTI#
#IRE#One of the most severe diseases affecting soybean is the Asian Soybean Rust (ASR) caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi H. Sydow & P. Sydow. The oxidative damage in cellular constituents and the disruption in the photosynthetic apparatus are the major negative effects of ASR on soybean plants. Considering the importance of nickel (Ni) on plant metabolism, this study evaluated the effect of foliar Ni-supply on ASR control, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, activities of antioxidant enzymes, parameters related to photosynthesis, and sugars levels on soybean plants. ASR severity decreased by 34% due to Ni supply. Infected and Ni-supplied (+ Ni) plants showed lower malondialdehyde level and superoxide (O2−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation in contrast to infected leaf tissues of non-Ni-supplied (− Ni) plants. The antioxidant enzymes activities were inefficient to avoid the high ROS accumulation for − Ni inoculated plants. The photosynthetic pigments, maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), effective yield of PSII, electron transport rate, rate of net carbon assimilation, stomatal conductance to water vapor, and transpiration rate values were higher and the yield for other non-regulated losses and internal CO2 concentration values were lower for + Ni inoculated plants compared to − Ni inoculated plants. High ROS production and the greater damage to the photosynthetic apparatus caused by P. pachyrhizi infection on − Ni plants affected the synthesis of the sugars. The infection also decreased the plant’s energetic reserves faster in − Ni plants compared to + Ni plants. In conclusion, the cellular oxidative damage and the impairment on the photosynthetic apparatus of soybean plants caused by P. pachyrhizi infection were alleviated by supplying Ni foliarly. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
