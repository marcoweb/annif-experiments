#ITI#The coupling effects of water deficit and nitrogen supply on photosynthesis, WUE, and stable isotope composition in Picea asperata#FTI#
#IRE#Water stress and nitrogen (N) availability are the two main factors limiting plant growth, and the two constrains can interact in intricate ways. Moreover, atmospheric N depositions are altering the availability of these limiting factors in many terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we studied the combined effects of different soil water availability and N supply on photosynthesis and water-use efficiency (WUE) in Picea asperata seedlings cultured in pots, using gas exchange, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope composition (δ 13C and δ 15N). Photosynthesis under light saturation (Asat) and stomatal conductance (gs) of P. asperata decreased as the soil moisture gradually diminished. Under severe water-stress condition, N addition decreased the Asat and gs, whereas the positive effects were observed in moderate water-stress and well-watered conditions. The effect of N addition on the intrinsic WUE (WUEi) deduced from gas exchange was associated with soil water availability, whereas long-term WUE evaluated by leaf δ 13C only affected by soil water availability, and it would be elevated with soil moisture gradually diminished. Water deficit would restrict the uptake and further transport of N to the aboveground parts of P. asperata, and then increasing δ 15N. Therefore, δ 15N in plant tissues may reflect changes in N allocation within plants. These results indicate that the effect of N enrichment on photosynthesis in P. asperata is largely, if not entirely, dependent on the severity of water stress, and P. asperata would be more sensitive to increasing N enrichment under low soil water availability than under high soil moisture. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
