#ITI#Effects of exogenous myo-inositol on leaf water status and oxidative stress of Capsicum annuum under drought stress#FTI#
#IRE#Drought-stressed plants accumulate cyclitols such as myo-inositol, pinitol, quercitol in the cytosol. These solutes (compatible solutes) protect plants from stress effects. Synthetic myo-inositol was used in the investigation of drought stress tolerance in pepper plants. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), membrane damage, ascorbate peroxidase (AP), catalase (CAT), proline and calcium increased in plants under drought conditions. Water status, calcium level, glutathione reductase activities increased in myo-inositol treated Capsicum annuum L. (pepper) under drought stress. Exogenous myo-inositol significantly decreased H2O2, membrane damage and proline levels and AP (except for 5 µM) and CAT activity, compared with untreated plants. Myo-inositol can play a role as effective as proline in signal transduction and in regulating concentrations of reactive oxygen species within tolerable ranges and in maintaining cell turgor by binding water molecules. Myo-inositol may become a useful instrument to eliminate the negative effects of drought environments. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
