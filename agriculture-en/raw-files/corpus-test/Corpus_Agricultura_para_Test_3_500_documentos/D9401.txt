#ITI#Effects of drought stress on the antioxidant system, osmolytes and secondary metabolites of Saposhnikovia divaricata seedlings#FTI#
#IRE#Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk is a traditional herb of East Asia. Bioactive chromones and volatile components in its roots are known to exhibit pharmacological functions. However, limited information is available on the drought resistance of this herb. In this study, potted Saposhnikovia divaricata seedlings were subjected to a progressive drought stress of 20 days by withholding water followed by twice rehydration, which resulted in some physiological, biochemical and secondary metabolite responses as well as drought acclimatization. A decline in leaf water content but increase in electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), glutathione (GSH), proline, soluble sugar, prim-O-glucosylcimifugin and 4′-O-β-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol content was observed. After rehydration, some of the indices recovered except proline, soluble sugar, prim-O-glucosylcimifugin and 4′-O-β-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol content. Moreover, mild (day 8), moderate (days 12–16) and severe (day 20) drought phases were identified. A total of 18 volatile components were identified by GC–MS under different drought phases, of which aromatic alcohols (42.02%) and sesquiterpenes (37.35%) were the major components. The characteristic component named falcarinol was decreased by severe drought stress. This study demonstrated that Saposhnikovia divaricata had strong drought acclimatization, and resisted drought by activating the antioxidant system and accumulating osmolytes. In addition, moderate and severe drought stress promoted bioactive secondary metabolites prim-O-glucosylcimifugin and 4′-O-β-d-glucosyl-5-O-methylvisamminol accumulation. Severe drought stress reduced falcarinol relative content, which provided an insight for improving the quantity of Saposhnikovia divaricata bioactive components. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
