#ITI#Leaflet gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence evidence the sensitivity of young açaí palms to progressive drought#FTI#
#IRE#This study aimed to examine whether the changes in leaflet gas exchange and chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence explain the sensitivity of açaí (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) palms to progressive drought. Thus, açaí seedlings were compared under well-watered (control) and water-stressed (water deficit) conditions for 11 days. In stressed plants, leaflet water potential (Ψw) dropped from − 0.76 MPa on day 1 to − 1.32 MPa on day 5, with negligible decreases on subsequent days. Water deficit induced significant decreases in net CO2 assimilation rate (PN), stomatal conductance (gs), and transpiration (E) from day 5. On day 11 PN, gs, and E were 106%, 96%, and 92% lower in stressed plants than in control. The substomatal CO2 concentration in stressed plants decreased significantly between days 5 and 8. Chl content, maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, and non-photochemical quenching were unaffected by drought. Significant decreases on photochemical quenching (qP) and apparent electron transport rate (ETR) in stressed plants were, respectively, observed from days 9 and 7. On day 11, qP and ETR were 55% and 59% lower in stressed plants than in control. ETR/PN increased in stressed plants from day 8 onwards. On day 10, ETR/PN was ten times greater in stressed plants than in control. Lipid peroxidation was only observed on day 11, when malondialdehyde content was 152% higher in stressed plants than in control. The decreases in net photosynthesis and photochemical reactions and the occurrence of lipid peroxidation under drought conditions support the perception that açaí palms are sensitive to mild drought conditions. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
