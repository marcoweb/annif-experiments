#ITI#Nickel bioaccumulation by the chosen plant species#FTI#
#IRE#The investigations aimed at the evaluation of nickel bioaccumulation ability of plants from various families (Poaceae-maize, Fabaceae-field bean and Asteraceae-lettuce). The research was conducted under hydroponic conditions. The experimental design comprised ten objects differing with nickel concentrations in the solution (ranging from 0.0 to 10.0 mg Ni dm-3 of the nutrient solution). The parameters, assumed as the basis on which nickel bioretention by selected plant species was determined were: the yield, nickel content in various plant parts, uptake and utilization of this element by the plant, tolerance index (TI) and translocation factor (TF), the metal concentrations in the aboveground parts index (Cl) and bioacummulation factor (BAF). On the basis of the obtained results it was found that, due to low tolerance of nickel, maize could be used as the indicator plant for the environment quality assessment. Â© The Author(s) 2016.#FRE#
