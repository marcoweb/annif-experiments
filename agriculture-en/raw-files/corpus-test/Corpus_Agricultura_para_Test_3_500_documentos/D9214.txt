#IRE#Effect of low temperature and low oxygen concentration on biochemical attributes, antioxidant enzyme activities, phenolics profile and expression of phenylpropanoid pathway-related genes was investigated in crabapple (Malus profusion) fruit. Crabapple fruit were kept at room temperature (RT, 20 ± 2 °C and 25 ± 2 °C alternatively at 12 h cycle) or low temperature (LT, 10 ± 2 °C and 25 ± 2 °C alternatively at 12 h cycle) and supplemented with either normal oxygen (21%) or low oxygen levels (5%) for 9 days. Results revealed higher concentrations of soluble solids, titratable acids, and ascorbic acid in fruit stored at LT + 5% O2. Likewise, total phenolics, peroxidase activity, and 2,2´-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)-radical scavenging activity were observed to be significantly higher in fruit stored at low temperature (LT + 5% O2 > LT + 21% O2), followed by those stored at room temperature (RT + 5% O2 > RT + 21% O2). In contrast, H2O2 and malondialdehyde contents were significantly enhanced in fruit stored at room temperature (RT + 21% O2 and RT + 5% O2), whereas fruit stored at low temperature showed minimum inhibition in superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase activities. In addition, low temperature induced biosynthesis of phenolic acids, whereas no considerable changes were observed in flavanols and dihydrochalcones during storage. Low temperature and oxygen conditions (LT + 5% O2) significantly enhanced the biosynthesis of flavonols (glycosylated quercetin derivatives) and cyanidin 3-galactoside, compared to LT + 21% O2, RT + 5% O2 and RT + 21% O2 conditions. In addition, low temperature also up-regulated the expression of MpFLS and MpUFGT in fruit tissues. Moreover, correlation analysis suggested positive association of antioxidant capacity with the biosynthesis of flavonols and anthocyanins in fruit stored at LT + 5% O2. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
