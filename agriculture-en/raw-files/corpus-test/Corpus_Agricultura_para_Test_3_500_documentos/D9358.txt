#ITI#A novel TaSST gene from wheat contributes to enhanced resistance to salt stress in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa#FTI#
#IRE#In this research, through the analyzing of the Triticum aestivum salt-tolerant mutant gene expression profile, under salt stress. A brand new gene with unknown functions induced by salt was cloned. The cloned gene was named Triticum aestivum salt stress protein (TaSST). GenBank accession number of TaSST is ACH97119. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results exhibited that the expression TaSST was induced by salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG). TaSST could improve salt tolerance of Arabidopsis-overexpressed TaSST. After salt stress, physiological indexes of transgenic Arabidopsis were better compared with WT (wild-type) plants. TaSST was mainly located in the cytomembrane. qPCR analyzed the expression levels of nine tolerance-related genes of Arabidopsis in TaSST-overexpressing Arabidopsis. Results showed that the expression levels of SOS3, SOS2, KIN2, and COR15a significantly increased, whereas the expression of the five other genes showed no obvious change. OsI_01272, the homologous gene of TaSST in rice, was interfered using RNA interference (RNAi) technique. RNAi plants became more sensitive to salt than control plants. Thus, we speculate that TaSST can improve plant salt tolerance. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
