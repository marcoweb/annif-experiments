#ITI#Responses of biomass allocation and photosynthesis in mulberry to Pb-contaminated soil#FTI#
#IRE#The allocation of biomass and photosynthetic capacities play critical ecological and productive roles in the adaptation of plants to environmental heterogeneity. Mulberry (Morus alba L.) is a woody species that has strong potential for applications in phytoremediation. For this study, the biomass allocation and photosynthetic characteristics of mulberry under different lead (Pb) concentrations in soil were investigated by combining exogenous biochar and partial root zone drought (PRD) treatments. The results revealed that mulberry could reduce the stem mass ratio (SMR), as well as increase the leaf mass ratio (LMR) and root mass ratio (RMR) in Pb-contaminated soil, which supported the functional balance theory of biomass allocation. Biochar and PRD maintained the LMR of mulberry at around 0.2. In the single soil Pb treatments, the average LMR, SMR and RMR increased by 0.022, − 0.067, and − 0.045, respectively, compared with the Pb-free treatment, while the corresponding values of combined biochar or PRD treatments were 0.012, − 0.038, and 0.026, respectively. Soil Pb reduced the photosynthetic rates of mulberry, which were coordinated through the regulation of the maximum carboxylation (Vcmax) and maximum electron transfer (Jmax) rates when subjected to soil Pb stress. Biochar decreased the RMR and increased the Vcmax and Jmax of mulberry, while maintained a relatively stable photosynthetic rate under different soil Pb stress levels. PRD not only promoted the photosynthetic rate, Vcmax, and Jmax, but also increased chlorophyll and carotenoid content and Fv/Fm value under Pb stress. To summarize, mulberry can adapt to Pb-contaminated soil by regulating its biomass allocation and photosynthetic rate. Furthermore, exogenous biochar and PRD could equilibrate the variation in biomass allocation amplitude and stabilize the photosynthetic apparatus of mulberry under Pb stress. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
