#ITI#Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and water availability affect biomass and C:N:P ecological stoichiometry in alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) during regrowth#FTI#
#IRE#Ecological stoichiometry has been widely studied in terrestrial ecosystems, but these studies have been limited in terms of symbiotic association between alfalfa and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), especially during regrowth. To evaluate the effect of AMF on the regrowth and C:N:P stoichiometry of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) under well-watered and drought conditions, alfalfa plants inoculated with AMF (Rhizophagus irregularis, M), nitrogen-fixing bacteria (Sinorhizobium, R), both nitrogen-fixing bacteria and AMF or no inoculations (CK) were evaluated in a pot experiment under controlled conditions. The biomass and organic carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) nutritional status of plant leaves and roots were measured under two water treatments during regrowth. Water deficit reduced the accumulation of dry matter and the concentrations of C and N in leaves and P in roots but increased the concentrations of P in leaves and C and N in roots of alfalfa during regrowth. Compared to CK plants, inoculation significantly improved the regrowth biomass and the concentrations of C, N and P in the leaves and roots and especially increased P levels when the plant were inoculated with AMF. However, this effect of microbes on alfalfa regrowth was dependent on the soil water status. Drought reduced the C:N and C:P in the leaves and the C:N in roots, while N:P and C:P increased in the roots. Inoculation of AMF decreased the C:P and N:P in the leaves and the C:N and C:P in the roots, whereas it increased the C:N under water stress. These results indicate that AMF play a significant role in regrowth and C:N:P ecological stoichiometry after defoliation by influencing C assimilation, N and P uptake and that the responses in the leaves and the roots are opposite. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
