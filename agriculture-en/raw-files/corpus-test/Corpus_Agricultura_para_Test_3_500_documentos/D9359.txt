#ITI#Role of Se(VI) in counteracting oxidative damage in Brassica juncea L. under Cr(VI) stress#FTI#
#IRE#Chromium (Cr) is considered to be one of the major environmental hazards and poses a threat to both plant and animal health. Selenium (Se), however, has been recognized as an essential micronutrient in plants. To understand the role of Se(VI) in oxidative stress management and regulation of antioxidative defence mechanism against heavy metal stress, the seedlings of Brassica juncea L. were raised in Petri plates containing nutrient media supplemented with only with Se(VI) and Cr(VI), or their combination. It was observed that of Cr(VI) causes an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the seedlings leading to oxidative stress. Histological studies using confocal and visible microscopy confirmed the biochemical results. Supplementation of up to 4 µM of Se(VI) to media containing 300 µM of Cr(VI) reduced the contents of ROS and increased enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants in the seedlings. At a concentration of 6 µM, however, Se(VI) was toxic. The results suggested that at appropriate concentrations, the exogenous application of Se(VI) enabled the B. juncea seedlings to counteract the effects of Cr(VI), thereby increasing the resistance of plants. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
