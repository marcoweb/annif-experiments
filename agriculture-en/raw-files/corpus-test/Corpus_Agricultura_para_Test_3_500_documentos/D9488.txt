#ITI#Genome-wide identification and expression profiling analysis of brassinolide signal transduction genes regulating apple tree architecture#FTI#
#IRE#Brassinolide (BR) is crucial for regulating plant architecture. Apple dwarfing rootstocks are used to control apple tree size. However, information regarding the effects of BR on apple trees is limited. In addition, the molecular mechanism underlying the dwarfing of apple rootstocks is poorly understood. To elucidate the role of BR signal transduction genes in controlling apple tree architecture, five BR receptor kinase 1 (BRI1), nine BR-signaling kinase 1 (BSK1), two BRI1 KINASE INHIBITOR 1 (BKI1), and seven BR-insensitive 2 (BIN2) genes were analyzed. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that gene duplication events likely contributed to the expansion and evolution of the identified genes. Nine homologs between apple and Arabidopsis thaliana were also identified, and their expression patterns in different tissues were characterized. Exogenous BR treatments increased the primary shoot length and altered the expression of BR signal transduction genes (MdBRI1-5, MdBSK3-8, MdBKI1–2, MdBIN1–4, and MdBIN6/7). The scion of Fuji/Malling 9 (M.9) trees exhibited inhibited growth compared with that of Fuji/Fuji trees. The Fuji/M.9 trees had lower levels of the positive regulators of BR signaling (MdBRI1-5,MdBSK1, MdBSK4/7, and MdBSK6) and higher levels of the negative regulators (MdBIN5-7) compared with the Fuji/Fuji trees. Thus, the above-mentioned genes may help to regulate apple tree size in response to BR. In addition, MdBRI1–5, MdBSK1, MdBSK4/7, MdBSK6, and MdBIN5–7 have important roles in different grafting combinations. Our results may provide the basis for future analyses of BR signal transduction genes regarding their potential involvement in the regulation of plant architecture. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
