#ITI#Influence of silicon on spring wheat seedlings under salt stress#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of the study was to examine the effect of silicon on spring wheat subjected to salt stress. The experiment was conducted in hydroponic conditions on 10-day old wheat seedlings. Salt stress was induced by sodium chloride at the concentration of 70 and 100 mM added to nutrient medium. Silicon (H4SiO4) at the doses of 1.0 and 1.5 mM significantly increased the shoots and roots weight of wheat seedlings and the content of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b, as well as carotenoids) in leaves. It reduced a detrimental effect of salt stress and restricted peroxidation of membrane lipids. We also observed a greater accumulation of nitrates and the decrease in malondialdehyde concentration in plant tissues as a result of silicon addition. Under osmotic stress, silicon did not change the content of sugars in wheat shoots and roots. Silicon did not clearly affect proline content. In general, the obtained results point out that silicon can be used for the alleviation of adverse effect of salinity on plants status. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
