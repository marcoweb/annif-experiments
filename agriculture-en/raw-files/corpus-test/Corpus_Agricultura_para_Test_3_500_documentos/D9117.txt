#ITI#Effects of benzoxazinoids in wheat residues may inhibit the germination, growth and gibberellin-induced α-amylase activity in rice#FTI#
#IRE#There is a rotational cropping system of wheat and rice in many areas. Wheat plants contain significant amounts of glucopyranosides of 6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (MBOA) and benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (BOA). After crop harvesting, MBOA and BOA are produced during the degradation process of wheat residues left in the field. The purpose of this study was evaluation for the effect of MBOA and BOA on rice growth and germination. MBOA and BOA significantly inhibited the rice germination and the rice shoot growth at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.3 mM and higher, respectively. MBOA and BOA also inhibited the induction of α-amylase in rice seeds significantly at concentrations of 0.03 and 0.1 mM and higher, respectively, and inhibited gibberellin-induced α-amylase activity in de-embryonated rice. Significant inhibitions in germination, growth, and α-amylase activity were observed as MBOA and BOA concentrations increased. The inhibitions on the germination, growth, and α-amylase by MBOA were greater than those by BOA, which is the demethoxylated analogue of MBOA. These results suggest that MBOA and BOA may inhibit the germination and subsequent seedling growth of rice by inhibiting the gibberellin-induced α-amylase production. Therefore, wheat straw and roots left in the field after crop harvesting may suppress rice germination and growth, because of MBOA and BOA in the soil originated from wheat residues. Further studies are necessary for the determination of MBOA and BOA levels in field condition after the crop harvesting. © 2015, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
