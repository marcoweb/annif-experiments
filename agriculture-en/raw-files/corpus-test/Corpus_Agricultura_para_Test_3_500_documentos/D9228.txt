#ITI#Mitigating effect of nano-zerovalent iron, iron sulfate and EDTA against oxidative stress induced by chromium in Helianthus annuus L.#FTI#
#IRE#Due to its wide industrial application, chromium (Cr) is known to be a critical environmental pollutant. Contamination of water and agricultural soil by Cr inhibits crop productivity and their physiological and biochemical processes. The objective of the current work was to investigate the effects of appropriate reducing agents such as EDTA, iron sulfate (Fe2+), and zerovalent nano iron (Fe0 nanoparticles) on growth and physiology of sunflower plants under Cr(VI) stress. Results showed that the Cr uptake increased by increasing the amount of EDTA, leading to a significant reduction in morphological and physiological parameters except for MDA and H2O2 contents. Treatment with Fe0 nanoparticles and Fe2+ reduced Cr concentration in root and shoot, increased root and shoot dry weight, plastid pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids) and proline contents; however, the level of MDA and H2O2 decreased significantly. All parameters were affected by Fe2+ during the first week of sampling; however, Fe0 nanoparticles affected all traits until the end of the third sampling stage. A statistically significant and positive correlation was found between root Cr concentration and MDA and H2O2 seedlings treated with EDTA, Fe2+, and Fe0 grown under Cr stress. From the result of this study, it can be concluded that sunflower has the potential for accumulation of Cr as a heavy metal, and treatment with Fe0 nanoparticles to prevent Cr uptake is more effective than other employed treatments. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
