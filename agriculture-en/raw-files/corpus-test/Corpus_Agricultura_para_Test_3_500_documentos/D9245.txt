#ITI#Control of potato tuber dormancy and sprouting by expression of sense and antisense genes of pyrophosphatase in potato#FTI#
#IRE#Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is an enzyme involved in sugar metabolism in potato tubers. In our previous study, we isolated an inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) gene from potato and obtained the transgenic potato plants transformed with the sense and antisense PPase genes respectively. In the present experiment, the physiological indexes, tuber dormancy, and sprouting characteristics of the transgenic potatoes were analyzed and evaluated. The result showed that the PPase activity and the inorganic phosphate content of tubers were lower in the antisense transgenic plant lines but were higher in the sense transgenic plant lines, compared with wild-type tubers. Soluble sugars, such as glucose, fructose and sucrose increased in transgenic plants that had overexpression of the sense PPase gene, but decreased in the antisense transgenic plant lines, compared with wild-type tubers. Tuber sprouting time of the antisense transgenic plants were delayed for 2 and 3 weeks and reached the 100 % sprouting rate only after 14 and 16 weeks storage compared with the wild-type when tubers are stored under 25 and 4 °C, respectively. In contrast, tuber sprouting time of the sense transgenic plants was earlier by approximately 2 weeks than that of wild-type tubers under these storage temperatures. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
