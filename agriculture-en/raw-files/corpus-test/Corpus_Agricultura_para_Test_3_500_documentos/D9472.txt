#ITI#Beating cold by being tough: impact of elevation on leaf characteristics in Phleum himalaicum Mez. endemic to Himalaya#FTI#
#IRE#Effect of altitude on leaf responses in Phleum himalaicum populations was evaluated at three different elevation levels, viz. (Low 1200 m.a.s.l.), middle (1600 m a.s.l.) and high (1900 m a.s.l.) in western part of Himalaya. We hypothesized that physico-chemical properties of soil varied along elevation and Phleum populations located at high elevation would adapt more distinct morphological and physiological traits than those originating from middle and low elevation sites. Our study revealed that soil pH, Ec Mg, Ca, and P decreased at high elevation however, significant increase was recorded in soil K, organic matter, and total nitrogen along the elevation gradient. A significant correlation between leaf characteristics and elevation sites was recorded along the gradient. The outcomes of this study showed that highland population had better adjustments under low temperature and exhibited adaptive traits. These were, decreased number of leaves and leaf area, increased leaf blade thickness, intensive sclerification, and greater stomatal and trichome density. Apart from these, high elevation population had more physiological adjustment in terms of low stomatal conductance, low transpiration rate, high water use efficiency, and synthesis of more osmolytes in leaf. We argued that certain level of sugar and protein must be attained by high population to dodge the aggressive climatic forces in order to grow successfully at the highest elevation. Furthermore, altitude between 1600 and 1900 m was more likely an optimum zone for vigorous growth of P. himalaicum at the highest level of elevation. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
