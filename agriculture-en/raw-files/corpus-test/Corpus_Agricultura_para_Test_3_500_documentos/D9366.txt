#ITI#Alterations in photosynthetic pigments, protein, and carbohydrate metabolism in a wild plant Coronopus didymus L. (Brassicaceae) under lead stress#FTI#
#IRE#Coronopus didymus has been emerged as a promising wild, unpalatable plant species to alleviate lead (Pb) from the contaminated soils. This work investigated the hypothesis regarding various metabolic adaptations of C. didymus under lead (Pb) stress. In pot experiments, we assessed the effect of Pb at varied concentrations (500–2900 mg kg−1) on growth, photosynthetic pigments, alteration of macromolecular (protein and carbohydrate) content, and activities of enzymes like protease, α-and β-amylase, peroxidase (POX), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in C. didymus for 6 weeks. Results revealed that Pb exposure enhanced the growth, protein, and carbohydrate level, but decreased the leaf pigment concentration and activities of hydrolytic enzymes. The activities of POX and PPO in roots increased progressively by ~337 and 675%, respectively, over the control, at 2900 mg kg−1 Pb treatment. Likewise, contemporaneous findings were noticed in shoots of C. didymus, strongly indicating its inherent potential to cope Pb-induced stress. Furthermore, the altered plant biochemical status and upregulated metabolic activities of POX and PPO indulged in polyphenol peroxidation elucidate their role in allocating protection and conferring resistance against Pb instigated stress. The current work suggests that stress induced by Pb in C. didymus stimulated the POX and PPO activities which impart a decisive role in detoxification of peaked Pb levels, perhaps, by forming physical barrier or lignifications. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
