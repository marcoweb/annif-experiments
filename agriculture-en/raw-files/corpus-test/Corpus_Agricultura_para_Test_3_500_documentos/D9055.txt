#ITI#Effects of cadmium and lead stress on somatic embryogenesis of coniferous species. Part I: Evaluation of the genotype-dependent response#FTI#
#IRE#Somatic embryogenesis is an important biotechnological tool that has significant potential to be used in studies related to environmental stress. In this study, embryogenic cell masses of Abies alba and Picea abies were grown on media enriched with 50–500 µM cadmium (Cd2+) or lead (Pb2+). The effects of cadmium and lead were evaluated during the subsequent stages of somatic embryogenesis: proliferation, maturation, and germination. The following characteristics were evaluated: proliferation potential, cell viability, average number of somatic embryos obtained per 1 g of fresh weight, and morphology of the developed somatic embryos. The tested heavy metals significantly reduced the proliferation rate of A. alba and P. abies embryogenic cell masses. The highest tested cadmium concentration markedly slowed or stopped the growth of embryogenic cell masses in both species. Unexpectedly, the proliferation ratio remained fairly high for the P. abies cell lines treated with lead at all concentrations tested. During the maturation stage, the total number of somatic embryos declined under cadmium exposure. The formation of early precotyledonary and cotyledonary somatic embryos in both species was similarly reduced, although cadmium caused a higher death rate and was more toxic than lead. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to study the effects of heavy metals on A. alba embryogenic cell masses during the proliferation stage as well as on the maturation and germination processes of both species. This in vitro system can be used for testing the response of large sets of genotypes, and the best performing lines can be used in the future for in vivo performance tests of heavy metal-polluted soils. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
