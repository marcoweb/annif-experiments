#ITI#Characterization of grain protein content gene (GPC-B1) introgression lines and its potential use in breeding for enhanced grain zinc and iron concentration in spring wheat#FTI#
#IRE#At least two billion people around the world suffer from micronutrient deficiency, or hidden hunger, which is characterized by iron-deficiency anemia, vitamin A and zinc deficiency. As a key staple food crop, wheat provides 20% of the world’s dietary energy and protein, therefore wheat is an ideal vehicle for biofortification. Developing biofortified wheat varieties with genetically enhanced levels of grain zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) concentrations, and protein content provides a cost-effective and sustainable solution to the resource-poor wheat consumers. Large genetic variation for Fe and Zn were found in the primitive and wild relatives of wheat, the potential high Zn and Fe containing genetic resources were used as progenitors to breed high-yielding biofortified wheat varieties with 30–40% higher Zn content. Grain protein content (GPC) determines processing and end-use quality of wheat for making diverse food products. The GPC-B1 allele from Triticum turgidum L. var. dicoccoides have been well characterized for the increase in GPC and the associated pleiotropic effect on grain Zn and Fe concentrations in wheat. In this study effect of GPC-B1 allele on grain Zn and Fe concentrations in wheat were measured in different genetic backgrounds and two different agronomic management practices (with- and without foliar Zn fertilization). Six pairs of near-isogenic lines differing for GPC-B1 gene evaluated at CIMMYT, Mexico showed that GPC-B1 influenced marginal increase for grain Zn, Fe concentrations, grain protein content and slight reduction in kernel weight and grain yield. However, the magnitude of GPC and grain Zn and Fe reductions varied depending on the genetic background. Introgression of GPC-B1 functional allele in combination with normal or delayed maturity alleles in the CIMMYT elite wheat germplasm has the potential to improve GPC and grain Zn and Fe concentrations without the negative effect on grain yield due to early senescence and accelerated maturity. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
