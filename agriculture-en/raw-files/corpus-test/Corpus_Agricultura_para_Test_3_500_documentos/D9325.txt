#ITI#Physiological and anatomical response of foliar silicon application to Dendrocalamus brandisii plantlet leaves under chilling#FTI#
#IRE#The physiological and anatomical responses of different concentrations (0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mM sodium silicate) of Si foliar-application in improving the chilling tolerance of Dendrocalamus brandisii plantlets were investigated. The Si-supplemented D. brandisii plantlets exhibited better chilling tolerance, associated with the enhancement of photosynthetic pigment and soluble sugar and starch content, increasing CAT and SOD activities and decreasing MDA and H2O2 level, as well as thicker leaf blades and mesophyll tissues. Furthermore, distinct changes in phytolith morphology were observed, including formation of a new phytolith morphotype (dumb-bell with nodular shark), significantly higher frequency of elongated phytoliths, and the increased length of elongated and elliptical phytoliths. Results indicated the physiological and anatomical response showed weak positive linkage with increasing amount of silicon applied, and the 1.0 mM sodium silicate on D. brandisii plantlet leaves was the most effective treatment in enhancing chilling tolerance. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
