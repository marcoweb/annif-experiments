#ITI#Effects of external supplied sucrose on the uptake and metabolism of glycine by pakchoi (Brassica chinensis L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Sucrose is crucial for plant growth, but research about the effect of sucrose on the uptake of different nitrogen (N) and the metabolism of glycine is lacking. The uptake of glycine by pakchoi, when it was in a mixture of glycine, nitrate, and ammonium or acted as the single N source under different sucrose levels were detected in a sterilized environment. The optimal sucrose level for pakchoi growth varied with N supply; it was 6 μM in the single N source of glycine, while it was 15 μM in the mixture. The N contribution of glycine increased under the optimal sucrose, while the N contribution of ammonium decreased. The effect of exogenously supplied sucrose on the uptake and metabolism of glycine is dependent on the N supply. With the single N source, the metabolism of glycine to serine in roots rather than uptake was the limiting step under a high sucrose level (300 μM). In the mixed nitrogen, active uptake and the metabolism of glycine to serine are the limiting steps under high sucrose level. Externally supplied sucrose affects the absorption and metabolism of glycine by pakchoi greatly, and this effect varied with nitrogen supply. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
