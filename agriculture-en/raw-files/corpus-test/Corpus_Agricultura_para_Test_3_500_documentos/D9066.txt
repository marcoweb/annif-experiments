#ITI#Evaluation of cold resistance in grapevines via photosynthetic characteristics, carbohydrate metabolism and gene expression levels#FTI#
#IRE#Low temperatures decrease the quality and reduce the yield of grapevine. Sucrose metabolism is among the key factors that explain the differences in cold resistance among different grapevines. We proposed that photosynthetic characteristics and carbohydrate metabolism are also associated with differences in cold resistance. To test this hypothesis, we measured the photosynthetic parameters of net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, ΦPSII (Fv/Fm), and total chlorophyll concentration, as well as the variations of numerous major carbohydrates (starch, sucrose, glucose, fructose, mannose, maltose, and raffinose), under short-term exposure to low temperature. We also examined the gene expression of two sugar-associated metabolizing enzymes, neutral invertase and sucrose phosphate synthase, in different tissues at the transcriptional level under low temperature. The photosynthetic parameters, carbohydrate concentration, and sucrose metabolism–related enzyme activities of grape plantlets all exhibited significant changes under low temperature. Our results showed that these changes differed among cold-resistant varieties and were closely related with cold resistance. This study provides an important theoretical basis for research into the cold resistance of wine grapes. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
