#ITI#The role of selenium in amelioration of heat-induced oxidative damage in cucumber under high temperature stress#FTI#
#IRE#High temperature is an environmental stress which destroys agricultural crops and inhibits their growth and productivity. The aim of current investigation was to examine the role of selenium (Se) on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) cv. Sahil plant growth, physio-biochemical and yield attributes under heat stress (HS) in controlled conditions. Plants were grown under normal temperature (NT; 28/18 °C day/night) from sowing to 32 days after sowing (DAS). All plants were foliar-sprayed with Se (8 µM) at flower-initiation stage (32-DAS) and heat stress (HS; 40/30 °C day/night) was induced from 35-DAS to entire duration of the experiment (75-DAS). Data regarding growth, physio-biochemical and yield traits were measured. Heat stress decreased growth traits, total chlorophyll contents, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, photosynthesis (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (E), antioxidant enzyme activities, membrane stability index (MSI) and yield-related attributes, while increased intercellular CO2 (Ci), ROS production, lipid peroxidation (LPO), non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and compatible solutes. Exogenous application of Se mitigated HS-induced injurious effects by improving growth components, Pn, gs, E, chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, antioxidant enzyme activities, level of osmolytes, MSI and yield attributes and reducing ROS, LPO and NPQ. Selenium reversed heat-induced oxidative damage by strengthening antioxidative mechanism, which resulted in higher scavenging of ROS, thereby minimizing LPO. It is suggested that Se-induced improvement in Pn, growth and productivity associated traits under HS is linked with enhanced antioxidant activities and osmolytes accumulation. In addition, Se applied at flower initiation is highly effective in alleviating heat damage in cucumber. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
