#ITI#Metabolic alternations of some amino acids, coenzymes, phytohormones and vitamins in chickpea crop grown from seeds soaked with defense stimulator#FTI#
#IRE#The metabolite profile of targeted amino acids, coenzymes, phytohormones and vitamins was evaluated in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) crop grown from seeds soaked with defense stimulator salicylic acid, benzothiadiazole or nicotinic acid (0.0, 10.0 or 20.0 µg/mL). The concentrations of analytes were determined at regular intervals covering five critical time points of crop growth. Liquid chromatography was used for the estimation of the test metabolites. In both leaf and root, the treatments progressively enhanced the biosynthesis of phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr), oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), pyridoxine, folic acid, riboflavin and rutin (vitamin P). The concentration of tryptophan (Trp), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), l-ascorbic acid (L-AA), niacin, thiamin (THI), β-carotene (vitamin A) and α-tocopherol (vitamin E) decreased. In leaf, the level of gibberellic acid (GA3) was enhanced and of menadione (vitamin K3) reduced. In root, the level of GA3 was reduced and of vitamin K3 increased. Consequent with the depletion of Trp level in plant, the levels of NAD increased whereas, those of master growth regulator indole-3-acetic acid and its precursor indole-3-butyric acid declined. With this, cytokinin level also reduced. NAD regulated the ratio of NAD: reduced form of NAD (NADH) which was less than that of NADP:NADPH. Tyr, Phe and Trp were the canonical variables for the observed metabolics. A strong correlation between the declining metabolite levels of vitamin E, L-AA, Trp, NADH, THI and vitamin K3 in leaf; and vitamin E, GA3, THI and vitamin A in root firstly attributed stress tolerance in chickpea agro-system. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
