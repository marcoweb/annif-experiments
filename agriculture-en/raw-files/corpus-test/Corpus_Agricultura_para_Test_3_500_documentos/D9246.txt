#ITI#Effects of salinity on activity and expression of enzymes involved in ionic, osmotic, and antioxidant responses in Eurya emarginata#FTI#
#IRE#Major constraints imposed by salinity, include ionic, osmotic, and oxidative stresses, which significantly affect plant growth. In an attempt to explore the mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance, enzymatic activity, and expression of genes involved in ionic, osmotic, and antioxidant responses of the typical coastal plant Eurya emarginata were examined under stressed conditions of 150 and 300 mM NaCl for 35 days. Physiological and biochemical parameters were also assessed. Salt stress adversely affected the growth of E.emarginata, as evidenced by reduced fresh weight (FW), leaf water content (LWC), and chlorophyll a and b contents. The inhibition of growth could be attributed to an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline contents, and Na+ concentration, and a decrease in K+ uptake in the leaves of E.emarginata. MDA and proline contents, and Na+ and K+ concentrations were closely related to activities of H+-ATPase, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS), and proline dehydrogenase (PDH), and antioxidant enzymes such as Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). To understand the basis for the observed differences, five genes encoding these enzymes were cloned from the leaves of E.emarginata by degenerate oligonucleotide-primed PCR to assess transcript levels under salt stress. At 150 mM NaCl, mRNA levels of CAT, GPx, P5CS, and H+-ATPase sharply increased, whereas mRNA levels of Cu/Zn-SOD, CAT, GPx, H+-ATPase, and PDH were significantly down-regulated at 300 mM NaCl. Therefore, the cloned genes may play an important role in determining how salinity tolerance is conferred in E. emarginata, which will facilitate further studies on the regulation of salt stress at the molecular level for this species. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
