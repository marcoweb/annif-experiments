#ITI#Hydroponic cultivation of Mentha spicata and comparison of biochemical and antioxidant activities with soil-grown plants#FTI#
#IRE#The development of controlled environment agriculture techniques such as hydroponics offers a viable alternative to obtain a high efficiency in water use and higher productivity in an environmentally sustainable way. A study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of growing Mentha spicata under hydroponic conditions and to compare its biochemical properties with that of soil-grown plants. The results confirmed that the productivity of M. spicata was higher in terms of crop biometric properties, yield and its influence on the biochemical properties. The per cent yield in M. spicata was 61% higher than the conventional soil farming. The antioxidant activity, enzyme activity and active compounds present in the plant extracts and presence of organic acids were higher in hydroponically grown plants when compared to the soil-grown plants. Similarly, the higher value of phenol and proline in soil-grown plants when compared to hydroponic plants indicated that the plants were subjected to some form of abiotic and biotic stress. Hence, it is suggested that the cultivation of these medicinal plants under hydroponic condition is a viable alternative in urban and peri-urban areas and avoids the problems that are characteristic in conventional cultivation of these plants. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
