#ITI#Impact of bio-fertilizers on germination and early seedling growth of Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) under salt stress#FTI#
#IRE#This study was carried out to study the effects of single and combined inoculation of rhizobial strain and PGPR at varying ratios on Lucerne grown under salt stress. Germination, seedling growth parameters, organic solutes and mineral ions contents of the seedlings were assessed after nine days of sowing. Germination, length and vigor index did not significantly change after inoculation. In contrast, under saline stress, application of inoculums significantly enhanced the germination and growth parameters. In addition, germination was less affected by saline stress than seedling growth, since the levels of reduction in growth-related parameters are higher. The effect of bacterial inoculation was strain specific and ratio dependent. The single inoculation and co-inoculation at the ratio of 2/1 were more effective under salt stress than the other co-inoculations suggesting the existence of synergistic interactions between the used strains. In opposite, the co-inoculation at ratio 1/2 was more effective on germination in the absence of salt stress. The inoculated seedlings accumulated less sodium and chloride as well as they maintained the same levels of K+ content compared to non-inoculated ones. Organic solute levels were not significantly influenced by both salt and bacterial inoculation in most seedlings. These results suggest that the Lucerne salt tolerance strategy does not directly involve organic solutes. These results indicate that application of these strains could alleviate the deleterious effects of soil salinity on seedling germination and growth, suggesting that these strains may be used as bio-fertilizers to enhance alfalfa establishment in arid and semi-arid areas. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
