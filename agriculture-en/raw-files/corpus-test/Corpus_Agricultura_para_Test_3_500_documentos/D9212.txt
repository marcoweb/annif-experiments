#ITI#Effect of silicon on grain yield of rice under cadmium-stress#FTI#
#IRE#Many publications indicated various beneficial effects of the addition of silicon (Si) in soil on the physiology of rice plants. The gene responsible for the Si-uptake in rice, low Si-influx 1 (Lsi1), was identified and cloned for this study. The photosynthetic rate (Pn), grain yield, and resistance to Cadmium (Cd)-stress of the wild-type (WT) and Lsi1-transgenic Lemont rice lines under Cd-stress were examined in an attempt to better understand the mechanism associated with the Si-addition, Cd-stress, and rice physiology. Si-fertilization significantly reduced the Cd-content in rice under Cd-stress. The effect was most significant in the Lsi1-overexpression transgenic Lemont rice (Lsi1-OE line) under high Cd-stress. Conversely, Cd in soil lowered the Si-uptake of the plants indicating a significant interaction between the two elements. During the grain-filling period, Cd-stress greatly reduced the chlorophyll content and Pn of the rice resulting in a diminished grain output. However, Lsi1-OE line with a higher chlorophyll content and Pn than either WT or Lsi1-RNAi transgenic Lemont rice (Lsi1-RNAi line) maintained a high photo-assimilate transportation for high yield potential. At harvest, Lsi1-OE line contained more Si and less Cd than WT, whereas the Lsi1-RNAi line showed an opposite result. In general, Cd-stress reduced, while Si-fertilization significantly increased, the grain yield on rice. However, no significant difference on the grain yields existed between WT and Lsi1-RNAi line. This might be due to a compensation effect generated by Lsi1-RNAi line. It appeared that Si in the soil, as well as the enhancing or inhibiting Lsi1 expression and the resistance to Cd-toxicity of the plants, could significantly affect the rice yield making alternations on these factors a plausible approach for production improvement. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
