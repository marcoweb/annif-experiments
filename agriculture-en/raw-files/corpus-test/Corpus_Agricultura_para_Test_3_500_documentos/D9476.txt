#ITI#Hydro and halo priming: influenced germination responses in wheat Var-HUW-468 under heavy metal stress#FTI#
#IRE#The beneficial effect of seed priming in improving critical growth stages like seed germination and early growth phases has been accepted by Plant Physiologists for many important field crops. In the present investigation, studies were made to see the effect of heavy metal stress imposed during germination using solution of HgCl2 in four different concentrations (0.0, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 mM) in Petri dishes on primed and non-primed seeds of wheat. Priming has been done with distilled water (hydro), Mg(NO3)2 and Ca(NO3)2 (halo) salts. Different germination parameters, such as germination percentage, radicle and plumule lengths, seedling emergence, soluble and insoluble sugar contents and activity of α-amylase in endosperm were studied at different study periods. Primed seeds increased all the germination parameters except insoluble sugar content in respect to non-primed control in the absence of HgCl2. However, the use of primed seeds has shown to overcome the inhibitory effects of heavy metal stress imposed in the form of HgCl2 solution during the period of germination. Hence, the work concludes the mitigating effects of priming under heavy metal stress. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
