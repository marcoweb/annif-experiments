#ITI#Evaluation and representation of ethylene effect on vase life and quality of rose (Rosa hybrida) cv. Vendela#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, changes in the quality and vase life of cut roses cv. Vendela generated by the presence and influence of ethylene were analyzed and represented. A static experiment was proposed to determine vase life by putting fresh floral stems in hermetic containers and introducing different amounts of ethylene in a range of concentrations from 0 up to 7 µL L−1 at 14 °C. The main ethylene response for Vendela roses was the petal abscission. Within the range 0–4 µL L1 vase life decreases as the ethylene concentration increases. At ethylene concentrations over 4 µL L−1, vase life did not change significantly. The results thus obtained allowed to establish that the flower vase life can be considered as a function of the ethylene concentration in the surrounding atmosphere up to a maximum value (5 µL L−1). From experimental data, a mathematical model to represent the cumulative petal fall (%CPF) as a function of exogenous ethylene was successfully adjusted. By using the above equation and by considering the senescence stage as that corresponding to %CPF = 5% a vase life model was established. The model can satisfactorily represent the vase life of cut Vendela roses at different ethylene concentrations and it constitutes a novel and useful tool that can be used to improve postharvest handling and storage and reduce losses of this type of flower. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
