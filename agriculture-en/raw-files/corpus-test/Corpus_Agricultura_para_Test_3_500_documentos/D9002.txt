#ITI#Molecular cloning and characterization of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes in eggplant (Solanum melongena L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Eggplant is rich in anthocyanins, which are one of the important secondary metabolites and beneficial to human health. In this study, four anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, including chalcone synthase (SmCHS), chalcone isomerase (SmCHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (SmF3H) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (SmDFR), were isolated from eggplant. Their expression profiles were investigated along with other two structural genes (SmF3′5′H and SmANS) in different tissues, bagging, and low-temperature treatments. The highest expression levels were observed in peels except for SmF3H which was detected in stems, and SmF3H was also the exclusive gene that did not show correlation with anthocyanin content. Unlike purple peels of the control, the bagged fruits displayed white peels and had no anthocyanin accumulation, because of the expression of SmCHI, SmF3′5′H, SmDFR, and SmANS totally depended on light. As low temperature stimulates anthocyanin accumulation, all the six anthocyanin biosynthesis genes were up-regulated in cold stress experiment, and SmCHS increased most obviously. Moreover, early biosynthesis genes (SmCHS, SmCHI, and SmF3H) responded earlier than late biosynthesis genes (SmF3′5′H, SmDFR, and SmANS) under low temperature. Subcellular localization suggested that the enzymes encoded by the genes cloned in this study were all located in cytosol and nucleus. To further characterize the function, their ectopic expression in Arabidopsis was performed, and overexpression lines displayed higher anthocyanin accumulation in stems and siliques. The present study provides insight into anthocyanin biosynthesis in eggplant and may facilitate genetic engineering for improvement of the anthocyanin content in plants. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
