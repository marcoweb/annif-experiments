#ITI#BcMF11 and its homologous sequences may form a lncRNA family in Brassica diploids#FTI#
#IRE#BcMF11 is a long non-coding RNA that has been identified in Brassica rapa and shown to be involved in pollen development. Here, when re-cloned the gene sequence, multiple paralogous copies of BcMF11 were identified in B. rapa (A genome). Multiple paralogous copies of BcMF11 were also found in B. nigra (B genome) and Brassica oleracea (C genome), the other two primary diploids of Brassica U triangle. While in the early diverging Brassicaceae lineage including Arabidopsis thaliana, no BcMF11 homolog was found. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the BcMF11 homologous sequences cloned from A genome or C genome could be clustered into a separate branch, respectively. However, there was no distinct cluster defined for BcMF11 homologous sequences cloned from B genome. The expression of BcMF11 in B. rapa was investigated and revealed a different result in the previous study. In addition, 12 expressed sequence tags from B. napus and B. rapa showing high similarities with BcMF11 were identified in the NCBI database, which further verified that rather than the useless repeat fragments in the genome, the BcMF11 homologous genes could transcribe. It is possible that BcMF11 and its homologous sequences may form a large gene family which might be originated in the recent ancestral lineage of Brassica. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
