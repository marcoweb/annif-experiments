#ITI#Salicylic acid alleviates oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation caused by clopyralid herbicide in Indian mustard plants#FTI#
#IRE#Two separate farm experiments (split–split plot with randomized complete block design) with three replications were conducted in 2018 and 2019 to determine whether salicylic acid (SA) seed priming or foliar spraying protects Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L.) plants from the adverse physiological and biochemical effects of clopyralid under drought and well-watered conditions. Three days after treatment, a high dose of clopyralid increased antioxidant enzymes activities, such as catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POX), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) proline, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and leaf temperature. It decreased leaf pigments (Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b, and Carotenoids) and plants' leaf water content (LWC). The drought had no significant effects on these traits, but the adverse effects of clopyralid were less under drought than under well-watered conditions. SA application, especially seed priming, significantly decreased oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation by lowering catalase and peroxidase activity and H2O2, proline, and MDA content. SA, particularly seed priming, also increased leaf chlorophyll, carotenoid, and leaf water content compared with clopyralid alone. Improving physiological and biochemical performance due to SA application indicates SA's beneficial impact on clopyralid detoxification. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
