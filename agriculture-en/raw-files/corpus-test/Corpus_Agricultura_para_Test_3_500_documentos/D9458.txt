#ITI#Leaf photosynthesis and CO2 assimilation in response to low nitrogen supply in bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.)#FTI#
#IRE#Photosynthesis plays a vital role in maintaining vigorous, healthy turf under nitrogen (N)-limiting conditions. The effects of low N stress on the aboveground growth of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.) as well as its photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, CO2 assimilation, and carbohydrate pools were studied using hydroponic experiments. Two bermudagrass accessions, Yangjiang (low N tolerant) and C716 (low N sensitive), were used. Low N supply decreased the aboveground dry weight of both accessions. In comparison to C716, Yangjiang maintained better aboveground growth, which was attributed to its smaller reductions in leaf area and the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) at low N conditions. The Pn reduction in both accessions was on account of a reduction in stomatal conductance (Gs) and was partially due to nonstomatal limitations. Furthermore, the smaller Pn reduction in Yangjiang than in C716 was associated with the smaller decrease in CO2 assimilatory capacity in the former, and the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activities decreased based on leaf protein content. Although the leaf sucrose synthesis capacity and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and sucrose synthase (SS) activities in Yangjiang increased more than those in C716, carbohydrates did not accumulate in the leaves of either accession to repress photosynthesis. This work provides new insights into CO2 assimilatory capacity rather than carbohydrate status under conditions of reduced leaf photosynthesis and decreasing aboveground growth in bermudagrass under low N conditions. Hence, bermudagrass accessions with low N tolerance are excellent sources of turf requiring reduced N fertilizer inputs. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
