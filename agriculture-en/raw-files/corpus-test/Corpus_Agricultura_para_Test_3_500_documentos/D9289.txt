#ITI#Effects of exposure of callus cells of two wheat varieties to silver nanoparticles and silver salt (AgNO3)#FTI#
#IRE#Metal nanoparticles significantly affect the physiological properties of plants, e.g., seed germination, growth and metabolism. In the present study, the toxic effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and silver ions were studied on callus cells of two varieties of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.): stress tolerant—Parabola; stress sensitive—Raweta. Stress induced by silver particles or ions (0, 20, 40, 60 ppm) was investigated using different parameters such as morphological characteristics, lipid peroxidation and mobilization of defense system which was determined by analyzing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione (GSH) and proline contents. Microscopic observations revealed deformation of cells after treatment by sol of higher silver concentrations. An increase in malondialdehyde content in both studied varieties was observed. Tested varieties showed an increased proline content in the silver-treated cells. There was no effect of silver on the superoxide dismutases activity, while the activity of catalase was significantly decreased. The changes in the activity of peroxidases in both varieties were opposite. The highest content of intracellular GSH was noticed at a concentration of 20 ppm of both AgNPs and silver ions. The presented results demonstrate a significant similarity of the effects caused by the studied stressors: silver nanoparticles and silver ions. The results characterized the mechanism of action of nanosilver on wheat callus: morphology disorder, damage to cell membranes, severe oxidative stress and in consequence intensification of production of non-enzymatic antioxidants. © 2016, The Author(s).#FRE#
