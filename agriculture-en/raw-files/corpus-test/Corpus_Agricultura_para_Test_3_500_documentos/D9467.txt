#ITI#Genetic diversity and population structure analysis to study the evolution of herbicide resistance in Echinochloa colona ecotypes in Australia#FTI#
#IRE#Echinochloa species is the most competitive and difficult to control weed in agricultural crops. It causes significant economical crop yield losses across the world. Echinochloa ecotypes possess great variability and thereby significantly reduce the efficacy of different herbicides. For effective control and reducing the competition for nutrients and space with crops, the study of genetic variability of among Echinochloa ecotypes is important for the success in weed management. In the present study, diverse ecotypes of Echinochloa colona (E. colona) were collected from infested areas of Queensland (QLD) and New South Wales (NSW) states of Australia, from a region of approximately 1.1 lakh hectares. The collected specimens were subjected to a genetic diversity analysis using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The cross-species transferability of newly developed markers in Echinochloa phyllopogon (E. phyllopogon) (EG302, EG306 and EG320) using the restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) approach exhibited a polymorphism in the E. colona ecotypes. Average polymorphic information content (PIC) was 0.34 across overall primer combinations. The unweighted pair-group method of the arithmetic average (UPGMA) showed a clear distinction amongst the ecotypes which were divided into four clusters in the dendrogram results. A Model-Based structure analysis revealed the presence of two distinct populations. However, four E. colona ecotypes collected from QLD and six from NSW possessed an admixture of alleles, which was suggestive of considerable gene flow between the herbicide-resistant and -susceptible ecotypes. This may have led to the evolution of resistance against the herbicides used to control E. colona ecotypes. Hence, the knowledge of the genetic diversity study in weeds can provide crucial information for designing an effective management strategy for invasive weed control. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
