#ITI#Relationship between lenticel discoloration and biochemical and quality attributes in mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruit#FTI#
#IRE#Postharvest lenticel discoloration (LD) deteriorates the external appearance of mango fruit and is supposed to be associated with biochemical changes in fruit peel. Hence, an experiment was executed to ascertain the relationship between biochemical parameters such as polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), lipoxygenase (LOX), total phenol content (TPC) and fruit quality parameters i.e., external appeal of fruit (EAF), total soluble solids (TSS), total carotenoids (TC) to the incidence of LD. 30 (20 indigenous and 10 exotic) commercial mango varieties of India grown at ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, were harvested at full maturity and stored at ambient conditions (24 ± 4 ºC, 75 ± 5% RH) for 10 days. During the storage duration, fruit analyzed for LD (%), biochemical and quality parameters. Results revealed significant correlations existed between LD % and biochemical parameters as LD vs PPO (r2 = + 0.98), LD vs POD (r2 = + 0.79), LD vs LOX (r2 = + 0.70) were found to be positively correlated, while LD vs TPC was negatively correlated. Similarly, among the quality parameters, LD found to have no relation with internal quality i.e., TSS (r2 = + 0.08) and TC (r2 = + 0.2), whereas negatively correlated with external quality i.e., EAF (r2 = − 0.71). Our findings suggest that monitory loss of mango growers because of LD is solely due to deterioration of external quality. LD does not have any impact on internal/nutritional quality. Furthermore, the positive relationship of LD % with enzymes suggests their role and biochemical basis in causation and control of LD. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
