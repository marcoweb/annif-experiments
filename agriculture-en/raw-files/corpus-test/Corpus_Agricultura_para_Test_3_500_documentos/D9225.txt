#ITI#Proteomic analysis in the induction of nodular cluster cultures in the bromeliad Vriesea reitzii Leme and Costa#FTI#
#IRE#Nodular cluster cultures (NCs) are globular organogenic clumps with a high regenerative potential applied to the large-scale micropropagation of bromeliads. In the present work, we identified differentially expressed proteins involved in the induction of NCs from seeds and leaf explants of the Brazilian native bromeliad Vriesea reitzii. Those explants were inoculated into Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium free of plant growth regulators (PGR). To promote the induction of NCs, the seeds were grown in MS medium supplemented with 4 μM α-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), and the leaf segments in MS medium supplemented with 4 μM NAA and 2 μM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP). After 21 days in culture, samples of each type of explant were collected for histological analysis and protein extraction. Proteomic analysis was performed by two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis and protein identification by MALDI-TOF–TOF mass spectrometry. Enhanced protein content and number of detected spots on cultures supplemented with PGR were observed as compared to the cultures maintained in PGR-free MS culture medium. Five differentially expressed proteins were identified during the induction of NCs: heat shock 22 kDa, chaperone protein dnaJ 50, S-adenosylmethionine synthase 3, UDP-arabinopyranose mutase 1, and 14-3-3-like protein E. Such proteins are involved in stress response, cell metabolism, and cell division. The ability to regulate the effects of stress conditions in which the explants were subjected shows the presence of competent tissues for the acquisition of the morphogenic route associated to the induction of NCs. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
