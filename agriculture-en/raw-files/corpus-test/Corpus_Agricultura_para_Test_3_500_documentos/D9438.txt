#ITI#Toxicities of nanomaterials and metals to rice under low atmospheric pressure#FTI#
#IRE#With the development of agricultural science and technology, the influence of nanomaterials on plants under low pressure is still not reported. Planting at the low-pressure place (in space or high-altitude areas of the Earth) is looking increasingly possible in the future. In this study, rice seedlings were cultured under low and atmospheric pressure, with the application of nanomaterials and Cd into the nutrient solution. We have investigated the influence of Cd, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, cerium oxide nanomaterials and their co-exposure effects on rice seedlings. Physiological parameters such as plant height and root length of rice remained non-significant under nanomaterials treatment. However, nanomaterials with Cd showed the inhibitory effect on plant height and root length as compared to control. Conversely, nanomaterials with Cd had no effects on rice biomass at atmospheric pressure but an average of 34.7% inhibit the biomass at low pressure. The low-pressure group showed that a low concentration of nanomaterials will promote the absorption of Cd in rice, and atmospheric pressure group showed that a high concentration of nanomaterials will promote the absorption of Cd. Transmission electron microscope images revealed that rice seedlings uptake the nanomaterials at both pressures. The results showed that low pressure would affect the growth and development of rice to a great extent, also affect the absorption of nanomaterials and Cd by rice. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
