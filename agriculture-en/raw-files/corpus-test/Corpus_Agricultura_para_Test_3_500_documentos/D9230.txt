#ITI#Comparative proteomic analysis of Phalaenopsis leaves in the vegetative and flowering phase#FTI#
#IRE#Phalaenopsis, an epiphytic crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plant, requires moderate variations of day/night temperatures for flowering. In this study, changes in chlorophyll content, chlorophyll fluorescence, sugar components, titratable acidity and soluble protein content in Phalaenopsis leaves during flowering were observed.  was performed for the first time using iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification). A total of 126 proteins were differentially expressed in Phalaenopsis leaves. Analysis of potential functions revealed that the major categories of predicted function of the up-regulated proteins were protein destination (27 %), photosynthesis (15.9 %), primary metabolism (14.3 %) and defense (12.7 %) in the flowering phase, while the major categories of predicted function of the down-regulated proteins were protein destination (33.3 %), primary metabolism (20.6 %), transportation (14.3 %) and signal transduction (11.1 %). Proteome profile analysis indicated that the proteome changes were consistent with changes in sugar and protein metabolites. Some novel proteins were differentially expressed, most of which were identified as signaling proteins, including 14-3-3 proteins, fibrillin, rapid alkalinization factors (RALF), the Ras-related protein RABB1c, calreticulin and calmodulin. Histone, importin alpha, multidrug resistance proteins and the ABC transporters were also differentially expressed. These results provide insights into the mechanisms that regulate flowering in complex flowering plants. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
