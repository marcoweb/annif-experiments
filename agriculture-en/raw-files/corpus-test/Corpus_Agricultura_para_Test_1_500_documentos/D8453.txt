#ITI#Exogenous melatonin expediently modifies proteome of maize (Zea mays L.) embryo during seed germination#FTI#
#IRE#Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) has a great potential for plant biostimulation. Its role in plant physiology is intensively explored, and its important function in plant stress defence frequently underlined. Melatonin is particularly effective when applied as an additional factor of seed priming. In the presented research, hydroconditioning was chosen experimentally as optimal for maize (Zea mays L.) seeds. The following seed variants were compared: controlled non-treated, hydroprimed with water and hydroprimed with melatonin solutions 50 and 500 μM. To identify modifications in proteome of maize seeds caused by the applied hydroconditioning techniques, protein extracts of germinated seed embryos (24 h, 25 °C) were separated by 2D-PAGE. Next, obtained maps of proteomes were compared (statistically and graphically) using PDQuest software, and characteristic spots of proteins were analysed qualitatively by mass-spectrometric techniques and identified in the Mascot protein databases. Research helped to identify hydropriming-associated proteins, and for the first time those which were expressed only in the presence of melatonin. Study confirmed that suitably selected pre-sowing treatment with melatonin, by embryo proteome modification, effectively prepares plants to adverse environmental conditions. In melatonin treated seeds during the initial state of embryos growth, even under optimal conditions, additional antioxidative, detoxifying, anti-stresses proteins were synthesized. Moreover, the supply of energy from seed storage substances was pretty intensified. The presented results partially explain how melatonin acts in plant stress defence, and why plants with higher melatonin content have exhibited increased capacity for stress tolerance. © 2016, The Author(s).#FRE#
