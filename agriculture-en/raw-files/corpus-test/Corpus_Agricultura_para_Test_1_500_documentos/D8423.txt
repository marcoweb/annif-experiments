#ITI#Modeling seed germination of unprimed and primed seeds of sweet sorghum under PEG-induced water stress through the hydrotime analysis#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of reduced water potential (ψ) on seed germination at 25 and 15 °C in unprimed (UP) and primed (P) seeds of two cultivars of sweet sorghum (cv. Keller and cv. Makueni local), were analyzed through the hydrotime model. Six ψ (from 0 to −1.0 MPa) in polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) solutions were used for the tests. Seeds were primed in 250 g/L PEG solution at 15 °C for 48 h. Decreasing ψ of imbibition solution reduced and delayed germination. At 15 °C seeds germinated less and slower than at 25 °C at any ψ. Seeds of cv. Makueni local exhibited a greater sensitivity to water stress in terms of germination percentage, than seeds of cv. Keller, but they were faster in germination. Osmopriming was beneficial for seed germination, both in terms of final percentage and rate, at any temperature and ψ. The hydrotime analysis revealed that predicted θH constant was increased when temperature was reduced to 15 °C and at this temperature median base water potential [ψb(50)] for germination was higher (less negative) than at 25 °C. Seed priming shifted ψb(50) towards more negative values and reduced θH requirements for germination. At 25 °C the two cultivars behaved similarly while at 15 °C cv. Keller exhibited a ψb more negative but required a greater θH to germinate, indicating a greater water-stress tolerance but a slower germination, than cv. Makueni local. The application of the model allows to identify water stress tolerant cultivars during germination, to include into breeding programs for the selection of well-performing cultivars under stress conditions. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
