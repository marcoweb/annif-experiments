#ITI#Modeling the effects of controlled drainage, N rate and weather on nitrate loss to subsurface drainage#FTI#
#IRE#Controlled subsurface drainage can reduce nitrate loss to tile flow, but the effects may vary with different N application rates and weather conditions. Interactions between these factors can be understood better via combinations of field experiments and modeling. Using an automated parameter estimation method (PEST), the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) was calibrated with measured monthly tile flow, N loss and flow weighted nitrate-N concentration (FWNC) from 2006 to 2008 in a corn and soybean rotation system with free drainage (FD) management. Similar data from 2006 to 2008 with controlled drainage (CD) management were used to evaluate the model. Changing from FD to CD reduced the annual N loss in tile flow by 22 and 32% based on measured and RZWQM2 simulated results, respectively. The model over-predicted the CD effect possibly because of the slope of the field, which reduces the effect of CD but is not simulated by the model. Long-term RZWQM2 simulations (1996-2008) suggest that N loss can be reduced by about 40% in both FD and CD by decreasing N rate from 245 to 140kgNha -1 with little effect on corn yield. A further reduction in N loss of 39% (9.3kgNha -1) was simulated by implementing CD at the reduced N rate, and the reduced N loss to tile flow was mainly associated with increased N loss to seepage (lateral flow) and crop N uptake. The percent of N loss reduction using CD relative to FD was magnified with increased rainfall (from approximately 20 to 50% with annual rainfall ranging from 600 to 1100mm), but the reduction varied only between 38 and 40% under different N rates (0-250kgNha -1). The results indicate that RZWQM2 accurately responded to CD compared to field measurements, and CD management in combination with reduced N application rates can substantially reduce N loss to the environment with little negative effect on corn yield.
