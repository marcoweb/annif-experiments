#ITI#Implementing irrigation: Water balances and irrigation quality in the Lerma basin (Spain)#FTI#
#IRE#The growing necessity to develop more productive agriculture has encouraged the expansion of new irrigated lands. However, water use in agriculture may affect the natural regimes of water systems. This study aims to analyze, for the first time, water use and its dynamics during the creation of a newly irrigated land. Water use was studied through the development of water balances and subsequent application of quality indices for irrigation in two unirrigated years (2004-2005) and three years of gradual implementation of irrigation (2006, 2007 and 2008) in the Lerma basin (752. ha, Spain). Increases in evapotranspiration, drainage and water content in the aquifer were verified during the gradual transformation into irrigated land. Water balances closed adequately, giving consistency to the results and enabling the application of quality indices for irrigation. Irrigation quality analysis showed a use of available water resources equal to 84%. However, the estimated irrigation efficiency presented lower values, mainly due to irrigation drainage (15%) and combined losses by both evaporation and wind drift of sprinkler irrigation systems (13%). The results indicate that the use of water in the Lerma basin is at the same management level of other modern irrigation systems in the Ebro basin, although there is still margin for improvement in irrigation management, such as reducing the irrigation drainage fraction and the evaporation and wind drift losses of sprinkler irrigation systems. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
