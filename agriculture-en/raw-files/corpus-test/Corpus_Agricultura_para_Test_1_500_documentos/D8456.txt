#ITI#Summer pruning improves the branch growth and tea quality of tea trees (Camellia sinensis)#FTI#
#IRE#At present, twice-a-year pruning is usually adopted for the tea garden, in which only spring tea is picked. Effects of different times and heights of summer pruning on tea trees are unknown. Here the effects of summer pruning on ‘Jin Guan Yin’ oolong mature tea trees were studied. The results showed that pruning at 30 cm (summer pruning at 30 cm above the cut surface of spring pruning) on Jul 25 could benefit to the growth of lateral branches, whereas two pruning treatments in August reduced their growth vigor. Pruning at 30 cm could also provide a benefit by decreasing the ratio of total tea polyphenols to free amino acids (TP/AA), an important factor in tea quality. Pruning at 30 cm and two pruning in August all significantly enhanced the contents of ester catechins [‘(−)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) + (−)-epicatechin gallate (ECG)’] as compared to conventional summer pruning. Pruning on Aug 15 (summer pruning at 20 cm on Aug 15) had the lowest (EGCG + ECG)%. In addition, enhanced AA content induced by pruning at 30 cm was significantly associated with enhanced transcription of glutamine synthetase (CsGS) or glutamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (CsGOGAT). In a word, the summer pruning at 30 cm on Jul 25 was best to benefit the growth of lateral branches and spring tea yield and quality, whereas pruning on Aug 15 had the worst comprehensive effects. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
