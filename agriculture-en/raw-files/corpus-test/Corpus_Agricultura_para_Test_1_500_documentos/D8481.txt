#ITI#Identification and transcriptional analysis of dehydrin gene family in cucumber (Cucumis sativus)#FTI#
#IRE#Dehydrins (DHNs) are a group II late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins that play essential roles in plant growth, development and responses to diverse environmental stimuli. Here, four DHNs in cucumber genome were identified using bioinformatics-based methods according to the highly conserved K-, Y- and S-segments, including 1 YnKn-type, 2 YnSKn-type, and 1 SKn-type DHNs. All of them are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and possess a large number of disorder-promoting amino acids. Secondary structure prediction revealed that each of them is composed of high proportion of alpha helix and random coil. Gene structure and phylogenetic analyses with DHNs from cucumber and several other species revealed that some closely related DHN genes had similar gene structures. A number of cis-elements involved in stress responses and phytohormones were found in each CsDHN promoter. The tissue expression profiles suggested that the CsDHN genes have overlapping, but different expression patterns. qRT-PCR results showed that three selected CsDHN genes could respond to heat, cold, osmotic and salt stresses, as well as to signaling molecules such as H2O2 and ABA. These results lay a solid foundation for future functional investigation of the cucumber dehydrin gene family in tissue development and stress responses in plants. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
