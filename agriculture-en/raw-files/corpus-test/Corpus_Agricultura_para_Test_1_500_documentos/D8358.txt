#ITI#An interval multistage classified model for regional inter- and intra-seasonal water management under uncertain and nonstationary condition#FTI#
#IRE#In regional water management, various uncertainties such as randomness, non-stationarities, dynamics and complexities, lead to difficulties for water managers. To deal with the above problems, a new methodology is proposed by introducing two methods nonstationary analysis, where the generalized additive model is selected to analyze and fit the distribution of water inflow; and model optimization, where an interval multistage water classified-allocation model (IMWCA) is formulated to optimally allocate the available water. By incorporating multistage stochastic programming, interval parameter programming and classification thought, the IMWCA model can tackle both stochastic and imprecise uncertainties, realize inter-seasonal dynamic allocation, and address the complexity of various water users. The methodology is applied to the Zhanghe Irrigation District to optimize water allocation for municipality, industry, hydropower and agriculture among winter, spring, summer and autumn. The Zhanghe Reservoir seasonal inflow is found to be nonstationary for all the seasons and can be well fitted by the corresponding distributions, showing the sense of nonstationary analysis. Additionally, the comparison with the other model demonstrates the need for classification. From the results, municipality and industry are more competitive than hydropower. The Dongbao, Dangyang and Zhanghe districts have a higher priority than the Jingzhou and Shayang districts for irrigation water. Water requirements are more likely to be satisfied in autumn. These solutions of optimal targets and optimal water allocation are valuable for optimizing inter- and intra-seasonal water resource allocation under uncertainty. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
