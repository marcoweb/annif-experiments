#ITI#Characterization of cadmium concentration and translocation among ramie cultivars as affected by zinc and iron deficiency#FTI#
#IRE#Zn and Fe are essential nutritional elements in plants and play important roles in various physiological processes of plants. Zn and Fe are chemically similar to cadmium (Cd); therefore, Zn and Fe may mediate Cd-induced physiological or metabolic changes in plants. In order to evaluate the interaction between Cd, Zn and Fe, we conducted a hydroponics experiment to determine the plant biomass, photosynthetic characteristics, and Cd accumulation of ten ramie cultivars under Zn/Fe-sufficient or Zn/Fe-deficient conditions in the presence of 32 µM CdCl2. Ramie varied among cultivars in morpho-physiological response to Cd stress as well as Cd accumulation, translocation and distribution. Zn and Fe deficiency increased the concentration and amount of Cd in plant organs, but decreased TFstem to leaf and TFroot to stem. Cultivars with more Cd in roots and shoots showed smaller increase in Cd accumulation under Zn and Fe-deficiency stress. Xiangzhu 7 and Duobeiti 1 showed a higher capacity of Cd accumulation in their shoots. Zn and Fe deficiency decreased Pn, but increased Ci, Gs, and E in most cultivars. The difference in Cd translocation among ramie cultivars was mainly ascribed to the difference in plant transpiration. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
