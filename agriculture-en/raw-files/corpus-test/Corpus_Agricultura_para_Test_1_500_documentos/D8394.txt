#IRE#Key message: Distinct differences in pioneer and fibrous roots acclimation to climate warming. Abstract: This study was conducted to determine whether belowground parts of plants at different planting density differ in their responses to elevated temperature (ET). We investigated plant growth, pioneer and fibrous roots growth, root nonstructural carbohydrates, and root colonization of Abies faxoniana seedlings grown in environment-controlled chambers with two different planting densities. Warming has more pronounced positive effects at low density. Although ET did not affect total root biomass, fibrous roots biomass increased under ET at low planting density while pioneer roots biomass was unaffected by ET, indicating that this species may maintain the main framework of the root system with a high capability for water and N absorption under ET. ET increased root nonstructural carbohydrates concentration and ectomycorrhiza colonization in fibrous roots. Increased root nonstructural carbohydrates in response to ET might be associated with the increased roots ectomycorrhizal infection under ET. The present study provided experimental evidence of distinct differences in pioneer and fibrous roots acclimation to climate change. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
