#ITI#Comparative proteomic analysis of the response of fibrous roots of nematode-resistant and -sensitive sweet potato cultivars to root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita#FTI#
#IRE#As a major root-knot nematode (RKN), Meloidogyne incognita causes serious losses in the yield of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.). To successfully colonize the host plant, RKNs elicit changes of dramatic physiological and morphological features in the plants. The expression of several genes is regulated as the nematode establishes its feeding site. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the proteomes in the fibrous roots of sweet potato plants by an infection of RKN to understand the effect of the infection on the plant root regions. This study revealed differences in proteomes of the RKN-resistant sweet potato cultivar Juhwangmi and RKN-sensitive cultivar Yulmi. During plant growth, Juhwangmi plants were shown to be more resistant to M. incognita than Yulmi plants. No M. incognita egg formation was observed in Juhwangmi plants, whereas 587 egg masses were formed in Yulmi plants. Differentially expressed 64 spots were confirmed by proteomic analysis using 2-D gel electrophoresis with three spots up-regulated in the two cultivars during RKN infection. Of these 64 protein spots, 20 were identified as belonging to such different functional categories as the defense response, cell structure, and energy metabolism. This study provides insight into the molecular and biochemical mechanics of the defense response and metabolism of sweet potato plant during nematode invasion. We anticipate that this study will also provide a molecular basis for useful crop breeding and the development of nematode-tolerant plants. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
