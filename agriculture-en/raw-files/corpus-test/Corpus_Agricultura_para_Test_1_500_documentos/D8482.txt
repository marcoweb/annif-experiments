#ITI#Nitrogen alleviates NaCl toxicity in maize seedlings by regulating photosynthetic activity and ROS homeostasis#FTI#
#IRE#Seven-day-old maize seedlings were subjected to NaCl (150 mM) without or with the presence of equimolar concentrations of urea, potassium nitrate or ammonium sulfate (at 60 kg N ha−1) for the subsequent 15 days. The results show that NaCl significantly decreased photosynthetic activity parameters (Hill reaction, Pn, Ci and Gs), shoot fresh and dry weights, chlorophylls, protein, GSH and AsA. The activities of ALA-D, Rubisco, PEP-C, MDH, PPDK, SOD, CAT and APX were significantly inhibited. On the contrary, NaCl significantly elevated MDA, O2 ∙−, H2O2, soluble sugars and proline. The application of the nitrogenous sources mostly ameliorated the photosynthetic activity synchronous with counterbalancing the decreases in growth, protein and pigments. The activities of ALA-D, Rubisco, PEP-C, MDH and PPDK enhanced remarkably with N applied under salinity. Furthermore, enhancements were detected in GSH and AsA contents and SOD, CAT and APX activities, which decreased free radicals, soluble sugars and proline. These effects reveal that maize was vulnerable to NaCl stress; however, N overcame the stress status and ameliorated the plant tolerance to salinity concomitant with repairing photosynthetic activity and maintaining higher antioxidants and ROS homeostasis; urea seemed to be the most efficient. Taken together, these findings conclude that N enhanced the capability of maize to tolerate NaCl via protecting photosynthetic apparatus for normal photochemical functioning and improving antioxidants and ROS homeostasis as effective salt tolerance mechanisms. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
