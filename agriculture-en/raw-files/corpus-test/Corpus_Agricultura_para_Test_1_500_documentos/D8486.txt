#ITI#Identification of nutrient deficiency in plants by artificial intelligence#FTI#
#IRE#The deficiency of macro (N, P, S, Ca, Mg and K) and micro (Zn, Cu, B, Mo, Cl, Mn and Fe) minerals has a major effect on plant development. The lack of some nutrient minerals especially of nitrogen, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and iron is a huge problem for agriculture and early warning and prevention of the problem will be very useful for agro-industry. Currently, the methods used to determine nutritional deficiency in plants are soil analysis, plant tissue analysis or combined methods between the two aforementioned ones; however, these methods are time-consuming and costly. This study proposes a new method for determining nutrient deficiency in plants based on the rapid fluorescence of chlorophyll a. In the process of this research bean plants are grown on a complete nutrient solution (control plants) compared with those grown on a nutrient medium, which lacks one of these elements—N, P, K, Ca or Fe. In this article, the mineral deficiency in nutrient solution is evaluated by the stress response of the plants estimated by leaves photosynthetic activity. The photosynthetic activity is estimated by analysis of the chlorophyll fluorescence using JIP test approach that reflects functional activity of Photosystems I and II and physiological state of the photosynthetic apparatus as a whole. Furthermore, the fluorescence transients recorded from plants grown in nutrient solution with deficiency of N, P, K, Ca or Fe, are used as input data in Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This ANN was trained to recognize deficiency of N, P, K, Ca or Fe in the bean plants. The ANN is presented as a potential tool for identifying/predicting nutrient deficiencies in bean plants, using records of the fast fluorescence of chlorophyll a. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
