#ITI#Development of a simulation method for paddy fields based on surface FTABLE of hydrological simulation program–FORTRAN#FTI#
#IRE#The Hydrological Simulation Program–FORTRAN (HSPF) is a widely used watershed-scale model; however, it does not comprise any functions that can be used to simulate rice paddy fields, thereby hindering its applicability in many Asian countries. To address this limitation, a paddy field simulation method was developed by considering the water detention effect and seasonal changes in the outlet height of paddy fields; this was achieved using the existing functions of HSPF. Surface FTABLE, a function of the relationship between surface water storage and outflow, was applied to represent the physical structure and inundated condition of paddy fields. Surface FTABLE was temporally changed by Special Actions, an HSPF module, to reflect the seasonal variation in drainage outlet height. By employing these methods, HSPF was applied to paddy fields for evaluating the model performance. On comparing the simulated and observed values of ponding depth and surface outflow, the model showed good performance with a coefficient of determination that ranged from 0.71 to 0.89 and an index of agreement that ranged from 0.92 to 0.97. Comparing the results of the simulation performed with or without Surface FTABLE, the simulation with Surface FTABLE exhibited a reduced surface outflow (−40.0%) due to the blocking effect of the paddy field, a decreased infiltration (−17.3%) due to the saturation of the upper soil zone, and a higher level of soil water in all subsurface layers. Based on these differences in each component, it is necessary to apply Surface FTABLE when considering the hydrological processes of paddy fields for HSPF modeling. The simulation method developed in this study only uses the existing functions of HSPF without performing any external modifications; therefore, it can be used conveniently to improve the applicability of HSPF in rice-growing regions. © 2022 The Authors#FRE#
