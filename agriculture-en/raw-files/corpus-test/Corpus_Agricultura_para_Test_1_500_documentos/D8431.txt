#ITI#Role of sucrose and phloem–xylem interaction in recovery of water status and hydraulic dehydration impacts in tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum)#FTI#
#IRE#The role of phloem–xylem interaction via sucrose exchanges in recovery of dehydration impacts, specifically xylem embolism, has not been directly investigated thus far. Most previous studies were indirect approaches leading to suggestive conclusions. We hypothesized that a block in phloem loading and so no exchange of sucrose with xylem affect tolerance and recovery of tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum) during dehydration and after the rehydration phase. Transgenic N. tabacum (αNtSUT1-antisense) plants, which showed impaired phloem loading and high accumulation of soluble sugars in leaves, were compared to the wild-type (WT) plants. The water status, osmotic adjustments, leaf turgor, stomatal conductance, xylem cavitation, and stem xylem sucrose content were determined during dehydration and after the rehydration phases. Results showed that retention of sucrose outside phloem conduits highly improved water status, osmotic adjustment and turgidity of the source leaves in the transgenics during drought period. However, no impact occurred on stomata function and tolerance to xylem cavitation in αNtSUT1. After the rehydration period, WT plants with free phloem transport and phloem–-xylem exchange of sucrose recovered better their water status, leaf turgidity, stomatal conductance and xylem functioning than αNtSUT1 plants. The accumulation of sucrose in leaves of transformants ameliorated their tolerance to water deficit by reinforcing the osmotic adjustment mechanism at the leaf level. However, lack of sucrose in phloem sieve resulted in impairment of hydraulic recovery of xylem from drought of αNtSUT1 after rehydration. This suggests a crucial role of the phloem–-xylem exchange of sucrose in refilling of embolized xylem vessels. © 2022, The Author(s).#FRE#
