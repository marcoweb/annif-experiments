#ITI#Physiochemical responses in coconut leaves infected by spiraling whitefly and the associated sooty mold formation#FTI#
#IRE#Biotic stressors contribute significantly towards the major loss of coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) economy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of spiraling whitefly (Aleurodicus rugioperculatus Martin) and sooty mold fungi (Capnodium sp.) on photosynthetic efficiency, metabolomics and oxidative stress as well as antioxidative status in leaves of coconut. Although, the leaves showed severe infection of spiraling whitefly and sooty mold fungi, however, hyphal penetration of the fungus into the tissue was not observed in the leaf. Even then, the combined infection by the fly and the fungi significantly reduced Chl a fluorescence parameters, such as FV/FO (efficiency of water splitting complex), area above the induction curve and PIABS (performance index of PS II on absorption basis), which could reduce the growth by lowering the photosynthesist in leaves. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the infected leaves induced membrane degradation and at the same time, it boosted the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The accumulation of different metabolites, such as amino acids, phenolics, soluble protein and soluble sugar content, was increased in infected leaves. In conclusion, spiraling whitefly and sooty mold infection did not directly disturb the host plant through hyphal penetration but as these organisms covered up the entire leaves, interruption in photosynthesis occurred and resulted in enhancement of various metabolites accumulation necessary to counter this particular biotic stress. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
