#ITI#An insight into the mechanisms of intermittent drought adaptation in sesame (Sesamum indicum L.): linking transpiration efficiency and root architecture to seed yield#FTI#
#IRE#Intermittent drought is a recurrent phenomenon in several parts of the world which limits the productivity of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) under rainfed conditions. As plant roots are the primary organs to sense soil moisture depletion, this study examined root morphological traits [(rooting depth (RL), root volume (RV), and root length density (RLD)] with plant functional traits [total transpiration (T) and transpiration efficiency (TE)]. Nineteen diverse genotypes were used under two water availability environments [intermittent drought (WS) and irrigated (WW) conditions]. The root traits and yield components were studied by growing them in a series of uniform polybag structures. Rooting depth and root length density varied significantly among the genotypes under WS conditions, but there was less variation in WW conditions. A weak relationship was established between root length density and T under both WW (R2: 0.19) and WS (R2: 0.10) conditions indicating that root length density could not be an adaptive trait under both conditions. However, TE with root length density (R2: 0.32), harvest index (HI) with TE (R2: 0.69), seed weight per plant with TE (R2: 0.65), and seed weight with HI (R2: 0.44) explained significant and positive relationship under WS conditions. Among sesame genotypes, IC-204622, IC-132186, IC-132207, IC-205471, and IC-73164 were performed better with high TE, HI, and seed yield under WS than other genotypes suggesting using these genotypes in a crop improvement program for the development of varieties adapted to drought. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
