#ITI#Growth, ionic response, and gene expression of shoots and roots of perennial ryegrass under salinity stress#FTI#
#IRE#Growth, ionic responses, and expression of candidate genes to salinity stress were examined in two perennial ryegrass accessions differing in salinity tolerance. The salinity tolerant (PI265349) and sensitive accessions (PI231595) were subjected to 75-mM NaCl for 14 days in a growth chamber. Across two accessions, salinity stress increased shoot dry weight and concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) and Na+ in the shoots and roots, but decreased shoot Ca2+ and root K+ concentrations. Salinity stress also increased root expressions of SOS1, PIP1, and TIP1. Plant height and chlorophyll content were unaffected by salinity stress in the tolerant accession but significantly decreased in the sensitive accession. Shoot MDA content did not change in the tolerant accession but increased in the sensitive accession. A more dramatic increase in Na+ was found in the roots of the sensitive accession. Relative to the control, salinity stress reduced expression of SOS1, NHX1, PIP1, and TIP1 in the shoots but increased expression of these genes in the roots of the tolerant accession. Expression levels of SOS1 increased in the roots and expression of NHX1 increased in the shoots but decreased in the roots of the sensitive accession under salinity stress. A decline in PIP1 expression in the shoots and dramatic increases in TIP expression in both shoots and roots were found in the sensitive accession under salinity stress. The results suggested maintenance of plant growth and leaf chlorophyll content, lesser Na+ accumulation in the roots, and lower lipid peroxidation in the shoots which could be associated with salinity tolerance. The decreased expressions of SOS1, NHX1, and TIP1 in the shoots, and increased expressions of NHX1 and PIP1 in the roots might also be related to salinity tolerance in perennial ryegrass. © Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków 2018.#FRE#
