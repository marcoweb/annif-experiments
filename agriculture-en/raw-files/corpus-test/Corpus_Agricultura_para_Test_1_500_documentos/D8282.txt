#ITI#Research on automatic irrigation control: State of the art and recent results#FTI#
#IRE#Availability of fresh water is one of the elementary conditions for life on Earth, however, water is a limited resource, which is now under an unprecedented pressure by global population growth, climate change and demand from several economic sectors such as tourism, industry, and agriculture. In particular, irrigated agriculture is one of the major water-consuming sectors. The aforementioned issues justify the need for a sustainable and rational use of water in irrigated crops, which motivates the implementation of new precise automatic irrigation technologies based on control theory. In this paper, we introduce the main concepts of control theory, how can it be applied to irrigation and a literature review of automatic irrigation control systems over the last decade. In addition, we present our latest developments in this field. In particular, we present some promising preliminary experimental results of four different control strategies applied to fruit trees in southern Spain to show the potential of the application of control techniques to irrigation.
