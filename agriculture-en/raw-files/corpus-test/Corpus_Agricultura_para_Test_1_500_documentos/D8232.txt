#ITI#Agroecosystem tradeoffs associated with conversion to subsurface drip irrigation in organic systems#FTI#
#IRE#Subsurface drip (SSD) irrigation is becoming increasingly prevalent in drought-prone irrigated agroecosystems thanks to greater yields and irrigation water productivity (IWP) and decreased weed pressure. However, potential tradeoffs for soil health and biogeochemical cycles remain unclear, especially in organic systems that rely on soil ecosystem services and biological processes for productivity. Gains in IWP and weed control were evaluated with respect to shifts in soil biological and physicochemical parameters in an organic processing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) agroecosystem. Yield, IWP, and spatial distribution of soil resources and microbial processes were measured in furrow and SSD irrigated organic processing tomato on long term organic fields. Higher IWP and lower weed density under SSD confirm known benefits, while altered distributions of inorganic N, salinity, microbial activity, and C/N cycling enzyme activities as a function of shifts in soil moisture highlight the far-reaching impacts of irrigation management on soil organic C (SOC) and N dynamics regulating resource availability. Decreased macroaggregate formation and greater unprotected C under SSD indicate that altered soil wetting patterns may reduce the C sequestration potential of irrigated land. Previously unknown tradeoffs should be integrated to develop irrigation strategies that maintain current and future sustainability and productivity of organic tomato agroecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
