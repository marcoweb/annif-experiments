#ITI#A morphophysiological analysis of the effects of drought and shade on Catalpa bungei plantlets#FTI#
#IRE#The interactive effects of shade and drought on the morphological and physiological traits of Catalpa bungei plantlets were assessed. Seedling growth, biomass, biomass allocation, leaf morphology, chlorophyll (Chl) content and gas-exchange parameters were measured in plants raised for 3 months under three light levels [80% (HI), 50% (MI), 30% (LI)] and two water levels [moisture (M) and drought (D)]. The results showed that shade greatly decreased growth, biomass, leaf area (LA) and Chl a/b; increased specific leaf area (SLA) and Chl content; and reduced photosynthetic rate (Pn). Drought reduced the growth, biomass, LA, SLA, Chl a/b, Pn, stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr) and intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci) and increased the Chl content. Stomatal closure was an early physiological response to water stress. Light, water and their interaction significantly affected plant traits and their bivariate relationships. The phenotypic plasticity index of light (0.47) was much higher than that of water (0.21), indicating that light was the main driver of the variations observed. Under drought stress, growth, biomass, leaf and stem biomass allocation significantly decreased in the HI and MI environments, whereas no significant difference was observed in growth or biomass parameters under the LI condition. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in Pn, Gs, or Tr under the LI condition under water stress. Our results showed that shade did not alter the negative effects caused by drought stress in MI but did alleviate the negative effects of the LI condition. In summary, the effect of drought on C. bungei plantlets depends on the irradiance conditions. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
