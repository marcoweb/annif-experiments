#ITI#Evapotranspiration and crop coefficients from lysimeter measurements for sprinkler-irrigated canola#FTI#
#IRE#Canola is a water-stress tolerant crop, which could be an alternative in areas with limited water resources. However, in arid and semi-arid environments where rainfall events are scarce and increasingly erratic, the use of irrigation is necessary for canola production to reach its maximum yield. The goal of this study was to determine the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and crop coefficients of sprinkler irrigated canola (Brassica napus L.) under non-limiting soil water content conditions. A 2-year field experiment was conducted in the lysimeter facility located in Albacete (SE Spain). A large weighing lysimeter (2.7 × 2.3 × 1.7 m), with an accuracy of 0.04 mm equivalent water depth, was used to measure the daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) rate throughout two growing seasons. ETc values were determined using daily mass change in the lysimeter. Cumulative ETc was replaced in the lysimeter through sprinkler irrigation applications, thus crop water stress was avoided. Seasonal lysimeter based (measured) canola ETc was 472 and 602 mm in 2008 and 2012, respectively. The 28 % higher ETc value in 2012 was mainly due to a much higher evaporative demand during the crop growth mid-season period of 2012. The Kc values were determined using grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo) calculated with the FAO56 Penman-Monteith equation and the ETc calculations from the lysimeter data. The dual crop coefﬁcient approach was used to separate crop transpiration (Kcb) from soil evaporation (Ke). For the two canola seasons, mid-season Kc and Kcb values, after FAO56 climate adjustment, were Kc mid (std) = 1.15 and Kcb mid (std) = 1.11. Those values were reached coinciding with maximum fraction of ground cover (fc) values of up 0.95 and 0.97 for 2008 and 2012, respectively. The seasonal evaporation component for sprinkler-irrigated canola was estimated to be about 24 % and 19 % of ETc in 2008 and 2012, respectively. The good linear relationship found between canola Kcb values and fc and the excellent agreement found between remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs) and different biophysical parameters, such as Kcb and fc, will allow monitoring and estimating the spatially distributed water requirements of canola at field and regional scales using multispectral satellite imagery. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
