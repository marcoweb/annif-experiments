#ITI#Canavanine involvement in the interaction of rice lines and Rhizoctonia solani#FTI#
#IRE#Canavanine is known as antifungal non-protein amino acid found in the legume. In the previous metabolome study of rice lines infected by R. solani, using CE/TOF-MS in positive ion mode showed that canavanine was detected, but unstable. To obtain the stable result, re-analyzed using MassHunter Workstation Quantitative analysis has been done in this study. The improvement analysis showed that canavanine was significantly higher in 32R than in 29S inoculated by R. solani. Furthermore, this result suggests that canavanine involves in the defence mechanism of rice line to the infection of R. solani. � 2016, Franciszek G�rski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Krak�w.#FRE#
