#ITI#Pre-inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum confers NaCl tolerance by improving nitrogen status and ion homeostasis in wild soybean (Glycine soja L.) seedlings#FTI#
#IRE#Leguminous plants and crops subjected to salt stress experience serious adverse conditions, such as ionic toxicity resulting from Na+ and Cl− accumulation, and malnutrition including nitrogen deficiency and chlorine imbalances. In this work, using two wild soybean (Glycine soja L.) accessions, the salt-tolerant BB52 and the salt-sensitive N23227, as the experimental materials, effects of pre-inoculation with Bradyrhizobium japonicum on seedling growth, contents of NH4+, NO3−, total nitrogen, K+, Cl− and Na+, ratios of Cl−/NO3− and Na+/K+, and the transcriptional patterns of NH4+, NO3−, Na+ and Cl− transporter-related genes under NaCl stress were investigated. Results showed that, compared with that on the non-inoculated NaCl-treated soybean seedlings, the salt damage on pre-inoculated seedlings was obviously mitigated as shown by the increased leaf RWC (relative water content) and reduced REL (relative electrolytic leakage) in roots and leaves; in addition, the contents of NH4+, NO3−, total nitrogen, and K+ (except in BB52 roots) in roots, stems and leaves displayed an apparent upward trend, while contents of Cl− and Na+, Cl−/NO3− ratio, and Na+/K+ ratio (except in BB52 roots) decreased markedly. Generally, the ameliorative effect on the salt-sensitive N23227 seedlings was slightly stronger than that on BB52 seedlings. Furthermore, compared with that in non-inoculated soybean seedlings subjected to 150 mM NaCl for 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h, the relative expression levels of most of the ten studied anionic and cationic transporter-related genes, such as GsAMT1.6, GsAMT2.1, GSNRT1-2, GSNRT5-5, GsNRT2 and GsCLC-C2, were clearly enhanced in roots and leaves of pre-inoculated BB52 and N23227 seedlings, and the upregulation of GsNRT1-3, GsNRT1-4, GsSOS1, and GsCLC1 varied only at the levels of soybean accessions and plant organs, i.e., roots and leaves. This suggests that the enhanced NaCl tolerance conferred on G. soja seedlings by pre-inoculation with B. japonicum may involve the upregulated expression of NH4+, NO3−, Na+ and Cl− transporter-related genes. This change in gene expression adjusts the uptake and transport capacity of the plant for these ions and their distribution towards the aerial plant parts, thus improving nitrogen deficiency and chlorine imbalances and re-establishing cationic and anionic homeostasis. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
