#ITI#Identifying patellin-like genes in Glycine max and elucidating their response to phosphorus starvation#FTI#
#IRE#Patellin1 (PATL1) is a plant Sec14-related protein, and several PATL proteins have been discovered in Arabidopsis and zucchini (Cucurbita pepo). However, little knowledge is gained about PATL proteins for crop plants. In this study, we identified seven PATL-like proteins (GmPATL) from soybean (Glycine max). These GmPATL proteins share the typical structure of PATL1, that is, an acidic N-terminal domain, a Sec14 lipid-binding domain and a C-terminal Golgi dynamics domain (GOLD). The predicted GmPATL protein sequences are highly similar within the Sec14 (71–98 %) and GOLD domains (55–99 %). Each of the predicted GmPATL proteins has 50–60 % amino acid sequence similarity to Arabidopsis PATL1 (AtPATL1) sequences. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that each GmPATL belongs to one of the three distinct clades of PATL1, PATL2/3, and PATL4/5/6. RT-PCR analysis showed expression of GmPATL genes occur mainly in the roots and stems, and are also up-regulated by phosphorus (P) starvation. The results from our study are helpful to further understand the molecular functions of PATLs in soybean. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
