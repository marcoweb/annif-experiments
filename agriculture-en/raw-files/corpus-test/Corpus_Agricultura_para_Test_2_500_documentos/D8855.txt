#ITI#A strategy for introducing an endangered plant Mosla hangchowensis to urban area based on nitrogen preference#FTI#
#IRE#To introduce endangered plants to urban green space for ex situ conservation successfully, it is important to better understand the optimal NO3         −/NH4         + ratios for profitable plant. Increasing nitrogen deposition altered the nitrate to ammonium ratio (NO3         −/NH4         +) in soil. This change may strongly affect the fate of endangered plants, which often have little ability to adapt to environmental changes. In this study, we carried out a microcosm hydroponic experiment by growing Mosla hangchowensis (an endangered species) to test its preference to NO3         −/NH4         + ratios and used congeneric M. dianthera (a widespread species) for comparison. Results showed that M. hangchowensis preferred an equal NO3         −/NH4         + ratio to NO3         − as an N source, with a higher biomass observed under NO3         −/NH4         + ratios of 50/50 and 75/25 than other treatments. However, M. dianthera preferred NO3         − as N source, with a higher biomass under NO3         −/NH4         + ratios of 100/0 and 75/25 than other treatments. NH4         + is the dominant form of N in atmospheric deposition in China and continued increasing in nitrogen deposition may be detrimental to M. hangchowensis, while only have minimal effects on M. dianthera. Urban regions are expanding, and the high environmental heterogeneity in urban areas can provide potential habitats for M. hangchowensis. Based on this study, we advise that the ex suit conservation of M. hangchowensis in urban green spaces needs to adjust the fertilization strategy according to the situation of nitrogen deposition to achieve the optimal NO3         −/NH4         + ratio. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
