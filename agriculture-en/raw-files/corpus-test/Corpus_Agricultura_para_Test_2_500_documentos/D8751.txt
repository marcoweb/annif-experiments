#ITI#Nitrogen and phosphorus as the factors affecting ginsenoside production in hairy root cultures of Panax quinquefolium cultivated in shake flasks and nutrient sprinkle bioreactor#FTI#
#IRE#The study assesses the influence of different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus sources on ginsenoside biosynthesis in Panax quinquefolium hairy roots cultivated in shake flasks and a nutrient sprinkle bioreactor. The saponin content was determined using HPLC. The maximum yield (12.45 mg g−1 dw) of the sum of six examined ginsenosides (Rb1, Rb2, Rc, Rd, Re and Rg1) in hairy roots cultivated in shake flasks was achieved in modified Gamborg B-5 medium containing 0.83 mM l−1 phosphate, 12.4 mM l−1 nitrate and 0.5 mM l−1 ammonium. The yield itself was 1.93 times higher than that achieved in standard Gamborg medium. The modified medium also favourably influenced the biosynthesis of studied saponins in bioreactor cultures. The saponin content (35.11 mg g−1 d.w.) was 2.75-times higher than that achieved in control medium. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
