#ITI#Responses of Zea mays L. cultivars ‘Buland’ and ‘Prakash’ to an antiozonant ethylene diurea grown under ambient and elevated levels of ozone#FTI#
#IRE#Increase in surface level of ozone (O3) in last 30 years is one of the major problems for global agriculture. Field experiment was conducted using open top chambers on two Indian maize cultivars (Buland and Prakash) grown under ambient (AO) and elevated (EO) O3 concentrations to evaluate the effect of an antiozonant ethylene diurea (EDU) given as soil drench. EDU application reduced the ROS production with concomitant decrease in lipid peroxidation. Inductions in activities of enzymatic antioxidants along with increased content of non-enzymatic antioxidants were observed in EDU-treated plants, though the response varied between the cultivars. Photosynthetic proteins (PEP carboxylase and RuBisCO large and small subunits) detected through SDS–PAGE analysis increased with EDU treatment. EDU also led to an increase in jasmonic acid and a decline in salicylic acid contents. The protective effect of EDU was further accompanied by increased pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids), foliar carbohydrates (starch and total soluble sugars), enhanced biomass, and economic yield. Effectiveness of EDU was more evident at higher O3 concentration and cultivar Prakash exhibited a more positive response with EDU as compared to Buland. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
