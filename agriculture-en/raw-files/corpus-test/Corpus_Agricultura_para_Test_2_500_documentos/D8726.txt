#ITI#Polyamines in yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L.) tolerance to soil drought#FTI#
#IRE#Polyamines (PAs) are related to many physiological processes, including soil drought stress. Two yellow lupin ‘Morocco 4’ (drought tolerant) and ‘Taper’ (drought sensitive) were exposed to soil drought for 2 weeks. The half of the examined plants were additionally sprayed with a solution of polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor—dl-α-difluoromethylarginine (DFMA). Yellow lupin leaves showed a 19% increase and seeds a 54% decrease in the total PA contents. The seeds contained fourfold less PAs than the leaves under drought conditions. The highest amount of spermidine and lack of agmatine were found in the leaves, while in the seeds the highest content of spermine and the presence of agmatine was confirmed. The use of DFMA under drought conditions decreased the content of spermine in ‘Morocco 4’ and ‘Taper’ (41 and 19%, respectively) and spermidine in ‘Taper’ (by 13%), as well as reduced two out of three of the yield components. More tolerant ‘Morocco 4’, after DFMA treatment was characterized by a higher spermidine and spermine content and a smaller decrease in yield components compared to the less tolerant ‘Taper’. Simultaneously subjecting plants to soil drought and DFMA treatment caused in ‘Morocco 4’ a decline in the number of pods and seeds per plant and seeds dry weight per plant (64, 50 and 54%, respectively), while in ‘Taper’ a reduction of the number of pods per plant and seeds per pod (32 and 27%, respectively) was observed. These results confirm that PAs are involved in yellow lupin tolerance and may play a protective function under soil drought conditions. © 2017, The Author(s).#FRE#
