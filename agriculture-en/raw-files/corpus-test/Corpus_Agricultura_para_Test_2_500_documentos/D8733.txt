#ITI#Better tolerance to water deficit in doubled diploid ‘Carrizo citrange’ compared to diploid seedlings is associated with more limited water consumption#FTI#
#IRE#Tolerance to water deficit in diploid (2x) and doubled diploid (4x) ‘Carrizo citrange’ (Citrus sinensis [L.] Osbeck × Poncirus trifoliata [L.] Raf) was investigated. Water deficit was applied for 4 weeks. Physiological parameters, including stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthesis (A), transpiration (E), leaf and soil water potentials (Ψleaf; Ψsoil), and pot water loss, were monitored throughout the stress. Moreover, ABA, H2O2 contents, and the expression of genes involved in ABA biosynthesis (NCED3), regulation of abscisic acid signaling (ABI1), and coding for a catalase enzyme (CAT2) known to favor H2O2 scavenging were monitored. During the experiment gs, A, and E values were most of the time higher in 2x compared to 4x. During the water deficit period, pot water loss decreased faster in 2x compared to 4x, leading to a faster decrease in all physiological parameters in 2x. The higher sensitivity of 2x compared to 4x was correlated with more numerous thinner roots, higher leaf ABA and H2O2 contents, and with the lower leaf water potential. ABI1 and NCED3 expression was not strictly correlated with the ABA content. However, the higher CAT2 expression in 4x was correlated with the lower leaf H2O2 contents. Therefore, the better tolerance observed in 4x ‘Carrizo citrange’ compared to 2x was associated with more limited water consumption and better and H2O2 scavenging. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
