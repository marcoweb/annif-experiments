#ITI#Comparative response of two wucai (Brassica campestris L.) genotypes to heat stress on antioxidative system and cell ultrastructure in root#FTI#
#IRE#The effects on root growth, root antioxidant capacity, and cellular ultrastructure were investigated using two wucai genotypes (heat-tolerant WS-1 and heat-sensitive WS-6) under heat stress (40/30 °C) for 5 days. Heat stress caused decreases in root biomass, relative water content (RWC), root vigor, and root traits of two wucai genotypes. In addition, it resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, superoxide anion (O2         −) formation rate, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content, but the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) were inhibited to different extents in two genotype wucai roots. However, these data indicated that the decline extent of WS-1 (heat tolerant) in root growth and antioxidant capacity was significantly lower than that of WS-6 (Heat sensitive). Microscopic analyses revealed that WS-1 (heat tolerant) showed a better cellular shape than WS-6 under heat stress and slightly oxidative damage; nuclear and mitochondria in WS-1 were of a better intact shape and clear bilayer membrane. Most importantly, the thicker root cell wall in heat-tolerant wucai genotype responding to heat stress was first reported. These results suggested that the ability of heat-tolerant wucai genotype to minimize the heat stress depended upon the higher self-regulation capacity and effectiveness of the antioxidant metabolism. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
