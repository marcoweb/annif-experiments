#ITI#Impact of specific environmental characteristics of the site of origin (shady, sunny) on anthocyanin and flavonol contents of replanted plants at common cyclamen (Cyclamen purpurascens Mill.)#FTI#
#IRE#The value of plant provenance (plant origin) is well-known phenomena in woody plants, but less is known in herbaceous plants (perennials). This study with common cyclamen (Cyclamen purpurascens Mill.) was conducted to reveal the importance of specific environmental site properties of plant origin for plant growth and plant quality in the next years. The plants were observed in years 2013 and 2014, more than 10 years after removing and replanting them from the original sites. Morphological characteristics of plants were evaluated by measuring the length and the width of plant rosettes, whereby plants originated from different sites did not show any significant differences. Additionally, the pigment composition, flavonol and anthocyanin content of plant leaves were evaluated. Plants removed from sunny sites showed significantly lower chlorophyll values (total chlorophyll, chlorophyll a) in the both observed years; lower carotenoid and total pigment values were measured only in year 2013. The prevailing anthocyanin in cyclamen leaves was malvidin-3,5-diglucoside with 57.28 µg l−1 FW in the year 2013 and with 103.68 µg l−1 FW in the year 2014. Plants originated from the sunny sites accumulated in 2013 significantly more malvidin-3,5-diglucoside in comparison with plants from shady sites of origin. The major substances from the flavonol group were quercetin-3-O-rutinoside and quercetin-dirhamnosyl-glucoside in both analysed years. The cyclamen leaves originated from sunny sites contained in 2013 significant more quercetin-dirhamnosyl-glucoside than cyclamen leaves from shady sites. The results of the study show that different stress parameters (irradiation and water supply in specific year) have a significant impact on the morphological and also internal parameters of cyclamen leaves. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
