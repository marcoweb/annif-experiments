#ITI#Different acclimatization mechanisms of two grass pea cultivars to osmotic stress in in vitro culture#FTI#
#IRE#Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a legume crop known from its tolerance to various abiotic stresses, especially drought. In this study, we investigated: (1) the response of grass pea seedlings to osmotic stress generated in vitro by polyethylene glycol (PEG); (2) potential drought acclimatization mechanisms of two polish grass pea cultivars. Grass pea seeds of two cultivars were sown on media containing different PEG concentrations (0, 5.5, 11.0 mM) and cultivated for 14 days in controlled conditions. Plants’ dry matter increased under osmotic stress (regardless of PEG concentration). In turn, the highest dose of PEG caused a reduction in seedling growth in both cultivars. Furthermore, PEG caused the peroxidase activity increase in whole seedlings and catalase (CAT) activity in roots. However, differences between cultivars were noted in: CAT activity in shoots; while phenols and anthocyanin content as well as electrolyte leakage in shoots and roots. In turn, in both tested genotypes, accumulation of proline increased in shoots under osmotic stress. Obtained results indicate that the examined plants, although belonging to the same species, differ in acclimatization processes leading to elevated tolerance to osmotic stress. © 2017, The Author(s).#FRE#
