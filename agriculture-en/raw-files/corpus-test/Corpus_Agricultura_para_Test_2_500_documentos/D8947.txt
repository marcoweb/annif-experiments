#ITI#Heat susceptibility of grain filling in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) linked with rapid chlorophyll loss during a 3-day heat treatment#FTI#
#IRE#Brief heat events (1–3 days, >30 °C) commonly reduce wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain size and consequently yield. To identify mechanisms of tolerance to such short heat events, 36 wheat genotypes were treated under day/night temperatures of 37 °C/27 °C for 3-days in a growth chamber, at 10 days after anthesis, and a range of developmental, chlorophyll and yield-related traits monitored. The degree of flag leaf chlorophyll loss during the treatment was the variable that showed the highest correlation to grain weight loss (r = 0.63; p < 0.001), identifying chlorophyll stability during this brief period as a potential determinant or indicator of grain weight stability under heat. Variables summarizing the combined during- and post-heat chlorophyll losses showed similar or lower correlations with heat tolerance of grain filling, despite the fact that genotypes varied in their ability to resume normal chlorophyll loss rates after the heat treatment. Additionally, heat tolerance of grain size showed no correlation with grain filling duration or traits relating to utilization of stem carbon reserves under heat stress. Measurement of chlorophyll loss over a forecasted heat wave was thereby identified as a potential basis for developing tools to help breeders select heat tolerant genotypes. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
