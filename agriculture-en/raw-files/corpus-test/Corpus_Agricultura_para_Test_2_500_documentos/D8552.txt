#ITI#Foliar application of betaine alleviates cadmium toxicity in maize seedlings#FTI#
#IRE#Greenhouse hydroponic experiments were performed to investigate the effect of the foliar application of betaine on the growth and physiological traits of maize seedlings in a setting of cadmium (Cd) toxicity. The foliar application of 500 μM betaine for maize exposed to culture medium containing 50 μM Cd significantly alleviated Cd-induced growth inhibition and dramatically decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation and shoot Cd concentration. Exogenous betaine significantly elevated the Cd-depressed soil plant analysis development (SPAD) value and improved photosynthetic performance (i.e., net photosynthetic rate, intercellular CO2 concentration, transpiration rate, and water use efficiency). External betaine significantly increased betaine content, shoot soluble protein content and catalase (CAT) activity in shoots and roots, but did not affect the ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and guaiacol peroxidase (POD) activities; furthermore, betaine enhanced the Cd-induced decrease in root Zn, Cu, and Fe concentrations and dramatically decreased Cd-induced increases in Na+K+-, Ca2+Mg2+- and total ATPase activities, which recovered to levels similar to those of the control. Furthermore, addition of betaine ameliorated the Cd-induced damage to the leaf/root ultrastructure. This research may elucidate how betaine improves the stress resistance of crops. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
