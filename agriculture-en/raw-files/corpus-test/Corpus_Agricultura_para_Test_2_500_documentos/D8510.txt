#ITI#Different chilling stresses stimulated the accumulation of different types of ginsenosides in Panax ginseng cells#FTI#
#IRE#Ginseng (Panax ginseng) is one of the most medically important plants in the world. Dammarane-type ginsenosides, which mainly include protopanaxatriol-type (PPT-type) and protopanaxadiol-type (PPD-type) ginsenosides, are the major pharmacologically relevant compounds that are produced by ginseng. Dammarenediol-II synthase (DDS) is the first committed enzyme in the ginsenoside biosynthetic pathway for dammarane-type ginsenosides, and PPD-type and PPT-type ginsenosides are catalyzed by protopanaxadiol synthase (PPDS) and protopanaxatriol synthase (PPTS), respectively. Ginseng cells are often used in stress studies. During their growth and development, ginseng plants are often exposed to cold stress. This study evaluated the effects of different chilling stresses on the accumulation of ginsenosides and the expressions of the DDS, PPDS and PPTS genes in ginseng cells. The results showed that continuous chilling (5 °C for 12 h) induced the PPT-type ginsenosides; whereas intermittent chilling (25 °C for 12 h and 5 °C for 12 h) stimulated the accumulation of PPD-type ginsenosides. The expression levels of DDS, PPDS and PPTS were clearly consistent with the accumulation pattern for PPT-type ginsenosides under continuous chilling stress or PPD-type ginsenosides under intermittent chilling stress, as was their order of involvement in the PPT-type or PPD-type biosynthetic pathway. These results indicate that different chilling treatments stimulated the accumulation of different types of ginsenosides, suggesting that cold stress may be one of the reasons for ginsenoside accumulation in ginseng cells. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
