#IRE#Rates of lipid peroxidation (LPX) and protein carbonylation levels under oxidative stress in plants with different tolerance to oxygen deficiency were studied. Rice and wheat seedlings were subjected to 24 h of anoxia followed by reexposure to normoxic conditions or treated with H2O2 and generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as methyl viologen, menadione, and a mixture of Cu2+ and ascorbate. Measuring thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), we showed that more severe LPX occurs in wheat under stress conditions compared to hypoxia-tolerant rice. However, in rice roots the initial concentration of TBARS was higher than in wheat. Post-anoxia also induced protein carbonylation in both plants but it was significantly higher in wheat seedlings. Immunoblotting analysis of carbonylation level revealed that protein damage caused by reaeration was more severe compared to the effects of oxidative agents in wheat. Generally, anoxia caused most LPX in plant shoots while protein carbonylation was more pronounced in the roots. LPX and protein carbonylation were reduced in rice after 24 h reaeration while wheat failed to decrease the level of oxidative modifications to the initial values during prolonged post-anoxia. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
