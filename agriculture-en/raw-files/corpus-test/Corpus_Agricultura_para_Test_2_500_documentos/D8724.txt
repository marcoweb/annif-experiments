#ITI#Chemical and hydraulic signals regulate stomatal behavior and photosynthetic activity in maize during progressive drought#FTI#
#IRE#The objectives of this study were to investigate stomatal regulation in maize seedlings during progressive soil drying and to determine the impact of stomatal movement on photosynthetic activity. In well-watered and drought-stressed plants, leaf water potential (Ψleaf), relative water content (RWC), stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf instantaneous water use efficiency (iWUEleaf), and abscisic acid (ABA) and zeatin-riboside (ZR) accumulation were measured. Results showed that gs decreased significantly with progressive drought and stomatal limitations were responsible for inhibiting photosynthesis in the initial stages of short-term drought. However, after 5 days of withholding water, non-stomatal limitations, such as damage to the PSII reaction center, became the main limiting factor. Stomatal behavior was correlated with changes in both hydraulic and chemical signals; however, changes in ABA and ZR occurred prior to any change in leaf water status. ABA in leaf and root tissue increased progressively during soil drying, and further analysis found that leaf ABA was negatively correlated with gs (R2 = 0.907, p < 0.05). In contrast, leaf and root ZR decreased gradually. ZR in leaf tissue was positively correlated with gs (R2 = 0.859, p < 0.05). These results indicate that ABA could induce stomatal closure, and ZR works antagonistically against ABA in stomatal behavior. In addition, the ABA/ZR ratio also had a strong correlation with gs, suggesting that the combined chemical signal (the interaction between ABA and cytokinin) plays a role in coordinating stomatal behavior. In addition, Ψleaf and RWC decreased significantly after only 3 days of drought stress, also affecting stomatal behavior. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
