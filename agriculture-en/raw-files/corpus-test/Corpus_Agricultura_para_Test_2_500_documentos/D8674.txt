#ITI#Azelaic acid accumulates in phloem exudates of TMV-infected tobacco leaves, but its application does not induce local or systemic resistance against selected viral and bacterial pathogens#FTI#
#IRE#Local and systemic effects of azelaic acid (AzA) pretreatments on local necrotic lesion formation induced by Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) were studied in Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi nc plants as measured by a semi-automated, computer-assisted method. Local application of AzA (0.2–1.0 mM) showed no or limited influence (either increase or decrease) on lesion size of TMV-inoculated leaves. In addition, AzA pretreatment did not modify the multiplication of TMV detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR. No significant systemic effect of AzA on lesion size of TMV was detectable in distant leaves. Moreover, AzA treatment had no considerable local and systemic effect on symptom expression and multiplication of incompatible (P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000) and compatible (P. syringae pv. tabaci) bacteria. The response of the viral and bacterial pathogens to AzA was not different if tobacco plants were exposed to light or darkness after AzA treatment. However, the amount of AzA, measured by HPLC–MS, was doubled in phloem exudates of TMV infected leaves as compared to the control leaves, but concentrated exudates containing AzA did not induce local resistance response. In addition, the amounts of two other short-chain dicarboxylic acids (suberic acid and sebacic acid) increased in phloem exudates of virus-infected leaves. All these results suggest that, at least in tobacco, AzA does not induce considerable local or systemic effects on viral and bacterial infections. Therefore, its formerly reported role in signal transduction and/or induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in Arabidopsis cannot be confirmed in tobacco. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
