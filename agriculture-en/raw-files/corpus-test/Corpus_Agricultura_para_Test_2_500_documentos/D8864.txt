#ITI#Fatty acid composition and PlFADs expression related to α-linolenic acid biosynthesis in herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.)#FTI#
#IRE#As a new α-linolenic acid (ALA) resource, there has been little known about the relationship between expression levels of fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes during seed development and fatty acid (FA) composition in herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.). In this study, oil content and FA composition of nine cultivars were measured at four different stages during seed development. Moreover, five genes including PlFAD2-1, PlFAD2-2, PlFAD3-2, PlFAD6 and PlFAD7 related to the ALA biosynthesis were isolated. Furthermore, the relative expression levels of these genes in seeds were investigated in two cultivars, that is, ‘PL1’ and ‘PL2’ with higher and lower ALA content, respectively. The results showed that oil content was from 17.03 ± 0.15 to 24.51 ± 0.15%; 15 kinds of FA were detected. However, the relative content of ALA was decreased during seed development. Although, the genes PlFAD2-1, PlFAD2-2, PlFAD3-2, PlFAD6 and PlFAD7 were all expressed during the seed development, the expression levels varied significantly. Most of the genes were expressed strongly in the early stage but weakly in the late stage except PlFAD6. Moreover, expression level of gene PlFAD2-2 was the highest while that of PlFAD7 was lowest at S1. In addition, the relative expression level of genes in ‘PL1’ (high ALA content) was higher than those in ‘PL2’ (low ALA content) during the early stage of the seed development apart from gene PlFAD6. This study provides a reliable theoretical basis for improving the contents of ALA by means of genetic engineering in the herbaceous peony seed oil. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
