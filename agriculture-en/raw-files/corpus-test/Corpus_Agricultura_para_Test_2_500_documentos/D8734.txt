#ITI#Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the GRAS family proteins in Medicago truncatula#FTI#
#IRE#The GRAS gene family performs a variety of functions in plant growth and development processes, and they also play essential roles in plant response to environmental stresses. Medicago truncatula is a diploid plant with a small genome used as a model organism. Despite the vital role of GRAS genes in plant growth regulation, few studies on these genes in M. truncatula have been conducted to date. Using the M. truncatula reference genome data, we identified 68 MtGRAS genes, which were classified into 16 groups by phylogenetic analysis, located on eight chromosomes. The structure analysis indicated that MtGRAS genes retained a relatively constant exon–intron composition during the evolution of the M. truncatula genome. Most of the closely related members in the phylogenetic tree had similar motif compositions. Different motifs distributed in different groups of the MtGRAS genes were the sources of their functional divergence. Twenty-eight MtGRAS genes were expressed in six tissues, namely root, bud, blade, seedpod, nodule, and flower tissues, suggesting their putative function in many aspects of plant growth and development. Nine MtGRAS genes were upregulated under cold, freezing, drought, ABA, and salt stress treatments, indicating that they play vital roles in the response to abiotic stress in M. truncatula. Our study provides valuable information that can be utilized to improve the quality and agronomic benefits of M. truncatula and other plants. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
