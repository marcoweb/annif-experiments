#ITI#Field performance of micropropagated and cryopreserved shoot tips-derived pineapple plants grown in the field for 14 months#FTI#
#IRE#Globally, production of pineapple fruits reached more than 25 million tons in 2013. Therefore, many scientists are searching for new varieties and ways for the conservation of pineapple genetic resources. Cryoconservation in liquid nitrogen has been described as a suitable technology in many plant species. However, its potential effects in the subsequent plant growth in the field should be studied before large-scale implementation of cryopreserved germplasm banks. This short communication describes the field performance of cryopreserved shoot tip-derived pineapple adult plants grown in the field for 14 months. Three genetic materials [cv. MD-2; cv. Red Spanish Florencia; Hybrid 54 (Smooth Cayenne/Red Spanish)] were compared. The following treatments were established in the field: (1) conventional micropropagation-derived plants; (2) plants from shoot tips never exposed to liquid nitrogen but submitted to pre-cryostorage conditioning treatments; and (3) plants from shoot tips exposed to liquid nitrogen. Results indicated that shoot tip exposure to liquid nitrogen did not alter pineapple field performance which supports cryopreservation as an important tool for conservation of pineapple germplasm. As far as we know, this is the first publication of a detailed study of pineapple agricultural traits after cryopreservation. © 2019, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
