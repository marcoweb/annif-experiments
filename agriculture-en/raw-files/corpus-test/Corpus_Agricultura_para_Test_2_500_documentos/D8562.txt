#ITI#Hydraulic regulation strategies for whole-plant water balance of two maize inbred lines differing in drought resistance under short-term osmotic stress#FTI#
#IRE#The conservation of water in agriculture requires an understanding of the mechanisms of plant–water relations. This study aimed to reveal hydraulic regulation strategies of maize (Zea mays L.) for maintaining the plant water balance during drought. The water relations of two maize inbred lines (Tian4 and 478) that differ in their resistance to drought in the field were investigated under well-watered conditions and osmotic stress induced with 10 % PEG 6000. The leaf transpiration rate and leaf water potential of 478 varied diurnally, but remained constant in Tian4, which is more drought resistant. Tian4 plants showed morphological, anatomical and physiological advantages that protected them from foliar water loss. The strategies of leaf hydraulics to regulate leaf water balance during the day and during short-term osmotic stress also differed between Tian4 and 478. The leaf hydraulic conductivity of Tian4 and 478 increased temporarily, but their root hydraulic conductivities were reduced under osmotic stress. However, the root hydraulic conductivity of Tian4 subsequently recovered. Lower and rapidly reduced leaf transpiration and the ability of root hydraulics to recover from short-term osmotic stress can help explain the strategies for plant water balance of drought-tolerant maize. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
