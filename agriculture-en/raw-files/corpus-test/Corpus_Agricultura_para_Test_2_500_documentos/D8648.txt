#ITI#Changes in physio-biochemical attributes and dry matter accumulation vis a vis analysis of genes during drought and stress recovery at tillering stage of sugarcane#FTI#
#IRE#Drought is one of the major factors affecting the productivity of bio-energy crop sugarcane which adversely affects plant growth and cane yield. Sugarcane plant responds to such stress by activating various physiological and biochemical attributes. In the present pursuit effect of drought imposed at tillering stage wherein changes in physio-biochemical and differential expression profile of genes associated with drought under field condition is envisaged using one commercial variety (CoLk94184) of sugarcane. Stress was imposed (120 DAP) by withholding irrigation for 90 days and then relative water content, chlorophyll and proline content were measured at 15 days intervals as well as at 2 weeks of re-hydration of the stressed plants. Plants under stress exhibited reduced RWC and chlorophyll content compared to their controls during progressive drought but regained significantly after recovery from stress. Proline content of stressed plant increased to 38.83% which declined to 7.9% compared to control plant after recovery. Growth parameters like cane length, cane weight, cane girth declined under stress over control by 55, 86 and 26% respectively. Overall dry matter reduction was 77.5, 70.9 and 14.2% over control when recorded at the end of the stress period, after 15 days of re-watering and at maturity, respectively. In general the overall expression of genes associated with drought dwindled concomitant with increase in sucrose% juice and Brix by 3.99 and 2.92% respectively, measured at maturity. The semi-qRT-PCR analysis showed differential expression patterns of POX, PROT, BADH, osmotin and lipoxygenase genes and activation of transcription factors like TF1, MYB and DREB genes when plants were exposed to stress which subsides after stress recovery. Results indicated that though drought imposed at early stage of the growth have significantly impacted the cane yield, better recovery potential after withdrawal of stress as exhibited by sugarcane, in turn, compensated cane yield by improving sucrose% juice in matured cane. © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
