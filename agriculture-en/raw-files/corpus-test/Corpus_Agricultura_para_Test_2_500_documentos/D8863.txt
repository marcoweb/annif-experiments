#ITI#Cold-induced physiological and biochemical responses of three grapevine cultivars differing in cold tolerance#FTI#
#IRE#In this study the cold tolerance potential of three Vitis vinifera cultivars including ‘Red Sultana’, ‘White Sultana,’ and ‘Flame Seedless’ was evaluated under greenhouse condition. After 15 leaves stage in average, the grapevine plants were subjected to cold stress regimes (4, 0 and − 4 °C) and compared with control plants (24 °C). A clear increase in leaf electrolyte leakage (EL), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and H2O2 concentrations was observed with decreasing temperature from 4 to − 4 °C in all grapevine cultivars. Chilled plants showed marked increases in their abscisic acid (ABA), soluble sugars, and proline contents in compared to control vines. Upon exposure to cold stress, the EL, TBARS, H2O2, and relative water content of ‘Red Sultana’ were found to be lower compared to ‘White Sultana’ and ‘Flame Seedless’. Under 0 °C condition, ‘Red Sultana’ had the highest superoxide dismutase, guaiacol peroxidase and catalase activities, which was approximately twofold higher than those of all other cultivars. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose increased from 4 to − 4 °C. These increments were higher in ‘Red Sultana’ compared to other cultivars which was concomitant with higher accumulation of endogenous ABA concentration in this cultivar. Higher accumulation of ABA and soluble sugars in ‘Red Sultana’ confirmed the key roles of these compounds in cold tolerance which could be applied as a cold tolerance marker for early selection of grapevine cultivars with the aim to establish vineyards in cold winter regions. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
