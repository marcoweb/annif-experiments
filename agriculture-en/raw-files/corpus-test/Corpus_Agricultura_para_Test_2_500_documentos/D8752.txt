#ITI#Exploring root plasticity to resource patches based on swarm behavior#FTI#
#IRE#Root architecture is of prime importance to assess the process of root plasticity affected by the resource distribution around growth zone of roots. Researches have revealed that roots demonstrate social behavior based on mutual interaction with their neighbors. Root-system architecture may be determined by two types of mechanisms: chemotropism and swarm behavior. Effects of the two mechanisms on the root plasticity attempt to be compared when root is grown under three different resource patches’ distributions using a three-dimensional architectural root model. Resource patches distributions included: (1) a completely random resource set, (2) a layered resource set, and (3) a gradient resource set. Roots length, total uptake, resource contribution rate for unit root length, and roots distribution in soil are analyzed to demonstrate comparison results. No significant differences with root length and soil profiles were observed between the two mechanisms at the three scenarios. For chemotropic mechanism, root uptake was more efficient than that of swarm behavior. For mechanism of swarm behavior, resource contribution rate for unit root length was higher than that for chemotropic mechanism. Swarm behavior may be considered as a working hypothesis and a plastic strategy for development and growth of roots. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
