#ITI#Morpho-biochemical traits and macro-elements of Lallemantia iberica (M.B.) Fischer & Meyer, as affected by winter (late autumn) sowing, chemical and nano-fertilizer sources#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of sowing season and nano-fertilizer source were studied on the morphological traits, biochemical compounds, and elements of dragon’s heads in a factorial experiment based on a randomized complete block design with 12 treatments and three replications at the research farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Urmia University in the 2017–2018 crop year. The experimental treatments were composed of two sowing seasons including spring and winter and six fertilization treatments including control, soil-incorporated NPK (NPK-s), nano-NPK (NPK-n), nano-chelated Fe (Fe), nano-NPK + nano-chelated Fe (NPK-n + Fe), soil-incorporated NPK + nano-NPK + nano-chelated (NPK-s + NPK-n + Fe). Based on the results, the interaction of the winter sowing and NPK-n + Fe produced the highest leaf area index, 1000-seed weight, and biological yield. In addition, the winter-sown plants treated with NPK-n + Fe exhibited higher chlorophyll and carotenoid contents and NPK contents. But, proline content was higher in the interaction of the spring sowing and the control. The same treatment also produced the highest carbohydrate content. Overall, the results indicate that the sowing season and fertilizer source have a significant impact on the quantitative and qualitative yield of dragon’s heads in Azerbaijan. Therefore, sowing season and fertilizer source should be simultaneously taken into account to attain a superior crop considering the environmental conditions. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
