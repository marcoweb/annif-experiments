#ITI#Effect of salinity and waterlogging on growth, anatomical and antioxidative responses in Mentha aquatica L.#FTI#
#IRE#Salinity and waterlogging are two stresses which in nature often occur simultaneously. In this work, effects of combined waterlogging and salinity stresses are studied on the anatomical alteration, changes of enzymatic antioxidant system and lipid peroxidation in Mentha aquatica L. plants. Seedlings were cultured in half-strength Hoagland medium 50 days after sowing, and were treated under combination of three waterlogging levels (well drained, moderately drained and waterlogging) and NaCl (0, 50, 100, 150 mM) for 30 days. Moderately drained and waterlogging conditions induced differently aerenchyma formation in roots of M. aquatica salt-treated and untreated plants. Moreover, stele diameter and endodermis layer were also affected by salt stress and waterlogging. Salt stress significantly decreased growth, relative water content (RWC), protein level, catalase (CAT) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities, and increased proline content, MDA content, H2O2 level and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Waterlogging in salt-untreated plants increased significantly growth parameters, RWC, protein content, antioxidant enzyme activity, and decreased proline content, H2O2 and MDA levels. In salt-treated plant, waterlogging caused strong induction of antioxidant enzymes activities especially at severe stress condition. These results suggest M. aquatica is a waterlogging tolerant plant due to significant increase of antioxidant activity, membrane stability and growth under water stress. High antioxidant capacity under waterlogging can be a protective strategy against oxidative damage, and help to salt stress alleviation. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
