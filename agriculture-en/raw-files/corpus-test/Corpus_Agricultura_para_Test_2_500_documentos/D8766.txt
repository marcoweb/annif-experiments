#ITI#Application of hydrotime model to predict early vigour of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) under abiotic stresses#FTI#
#IRE#Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is important for edible oil production in semi-arid areas. Abiotic stresses are threatening rapeseed production in such areas. This study was conducted to find tolerant genotypes of rapeseed and to determine which traits of crop establishment is related to abiotic stress tolerance. Hydrotime model parameters were determined in a laboratory germination test, and seedling emergence and growth were evaluated in pot experiments under control, drought, salinity, deep sowing, low and high temperatures for 19 rapeseed genotypes. Results indicated that the predicted germination time courses at the various water potentials generally fitted well with the observed germination data. The estimated values of θH, ψb(50), and σψb differed significantly across genotypes. Seedling emergence and growth differed significantly under each environmental condition. PCA showed that genotypes of Hayola 401 and line 285 were the most tolerant to abiotic stresses during crop establishment and seedling growth. The first PC explained 40% of variations, and a correlation was observed between PC1 and ψb(50). Correlations among hydrotime model parameters and early seed vigour variables indicated that ψb(50) negatively correlated with seedling emergence percentage and rate (day−1) under all abiotic stresses. It shows that genotypes with more negative values of ψb(50) have more seedling emergence percentage and a larger seedling emergence rate (days−1) under a wide range of environmental conditions. Thus, it can be concluded that, to identify tolerant genotypes of rapesee to abiotic stresses, ψb(50) is a good trait and that breeders can focus on reducing ψb(50) to increase tolerance of abiotic stresses. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
