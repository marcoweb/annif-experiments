#ITI#Characterization of ERF76 promoter cloned from Populus simonii × P. nigra#FTI#
#IRE#The poplar transcription factor ERF76 gene is salt-inducible and plays an important role in regulating stress-related genes. To understand the regulatory mechanisms of ERF76 gene, the 1537-bp upstream DNA sequence of ERF76 gene was cloned from di-haploid Populus simonii × P. nigra. Sequence analysis indicated that the fragment contains a series of regulatory elements related to defense and stress responsiveness. The protein–DNA interaction assay indicated that the sequence interacted with proteins involved in oxidoreductase activity and plant defense and stress response. Biological evidence from promoter segmentation and deletion analysis demonstrated that the promoter segments in different length possess different transcriptional activity and respond to salt stress differentially in transgenic Arabidopsis. The characterization of ERF76 promoter provides mechanistic understanding of ERF76 gene in salt stress responses. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
