#ITI#Is duality between proline metabolic mutation (p5cs 1-4) and durum wheat dehydrin transgenic contexts a “pacemaker” for salt tolerance process in Arabidopsis thaliana?#FTI#
#IRE#                             According to both the proline metabolic mutation context (p5cs 1-4) and the effective involvement of the durum wheat dehydrin transgenic context (DH2 and DH4) against salt stress, we report here some response elements that can give rise to clarification if there is duality between proline metabolic mutation context (p5cs 1-4) and the durum wheat dehydrin transgenic context for salt tolerance process acquisition. Furthermore, some physiological, biochemical and metabolic assessments were monitored. The studied lines (Wt, DH2, DH4 and P5CS1-4) share the same chlorophyll level (82, 76, 77 and 79, respectively), under MS medium. In MS–proline and MS–proline–NaCl media, the chlorophyll level of transgenic lines (DH2 and DH4) upgrades per comparison with Wt and P5CS1-4 (92, 96, 84 and 82, respectively). The same fact is observed in the MS–NaCl medium. The proline accumulation and also the P5CS activity determination give rise to proportional behaviors for both the studied lines under the studied cultural conditions. Those results and others described here give birth to two parameters, the global ROS scavenging system index (GI) and the system apparent velocity (µ                             app                             ) giving proof of the enhancement of the capability to tolerate salinity in Arabidopsis transgenic plants. Eventually, the described fact is illustrated using the “Deming wheel” model.                          © 2019, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
