#ITI#Greenhouse performance, genetic stability and biochemical compounds in Chrysanthemum morifolium ‘Hangju’ plants regenerated from cryopreserved shoot tips#FTI#
#IRE#Chrysanthemum morifolium ‘Hangju’ is a valuable medicinal plant. We previously reported cryopreservation of shoot tips of C. morifolium ‘Hangju’. The present study further evaluated greenhouse performance, assessed genetic stability and analyzed biochemical compounds in the greenhouse-grown plants regenerated from cryopreservation. The results showed that although some minor alternations were detected in early vegetative growth, there were no differences in major parameters of vegetative growth and flower production between the plants regenerated from cryopreservation and in vitro shoots (the control). Morphologies of leaves and flowers were identical between the two types of the plants. No polymorphic bands revealed by ISSR and RAPD, and no alternations at ploidy levels analyzed by FCM were found in the cryo-derived plants. The types and number of biochemical compounds analyzed by UPLC-MS/MS were identical between the two types of the plants. Quantitative analyses by HPLC showed no differences in the contents of the five selected biochemical compounds produced between the plants regenerated from cryopreservation and in vitro shoots. Therefore, cryopreservation would provide a technical platform for establishment of cryo-banking of Chrysanthemum germplasm with medicinal values. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
