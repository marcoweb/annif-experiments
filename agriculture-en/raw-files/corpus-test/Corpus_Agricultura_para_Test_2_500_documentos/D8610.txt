#ITI#From green to red: large-scale transcriptome comparison of a bud sport in poplar (Populus deltoides)#FTI#
#IRE#The red-leaf coloration of Quanhong poplar (QHP) (Populus deltoides), resulting from a bud sport, is a distinctive trait conferring high ornamental value. However, the underlying molecular coloration mechanism of the red-leaf poplar remains unknown. In this study, tissue buds and leaves from mutant QHP(red)and its wild-type progenitor L2025 (green) were used to study the coloration mechanism by high-throughput RNA sequencing and comparative analysis of the transcriptomes. A total of 12,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. Functional enrichment using Gene Ontology (GO) and, Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations showed that 4951 bud DEGs and 1927 leaf DEGs participate in many important biological and metabolic pathways, including anthocyanin biosynthesis. Importantly, some structural genes that contribute to photosynthesis were down-regulated, and some candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene and anthocyanin were up-regulated in the QHP mutant. The DEGs identified provided insight into the novel traits of the mutant. The unigene dataset that was used to discover candidate genes provides a comprehensive resource for molecular research in red-leaf poplar and may provide insight into coloration of other woody plants. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
