#ITI#Silicon nutrition alleviates the lipid peroxidation and ion imbalance of Glycyrrhiza uralensis seedlings under salt stress#FTI#
#IRE#Soil salinity reduces growth of Glycyrrhiza uralensis in arid and semi-arid areas of north-west in China. Silicon (Si) nutrition may alleviate salt stress in many crops including grain crop, fruit crop, and vegetable crop. In this study, the alleviating effects of Si on growth characteristics, antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD and POD) and MDA concentration, and K+ and Na+ concentrations in G. uralensis seedlings subjected to 50 mM NaCl stress were investigated. The results showed that NaCl stress imposed significant reduction in root length, secondary root number, leaf number, and stem and total dry weight of G. uralensis. NaCl stress also significantly reduced the activities of SOD and POD, and ration of K+/Na+, but significantly increased MDA concentration in leaves of G. uralensis seedling. The addition of Si increased SOD and POD activities, and reduced MDA concentration, which resulting in greater reactive oxygen species detoxification and lower lipid peroxidation. Si also significantly increased the ratio of K+/Na+ in stem and leaves of G. uralensis. In conclusion, Si could alleviate adverse effects of salt stress probably by decreasing Na+ concentration and improving antioxidant enzyme activity of G. uralensis, and these alleviating effects were dependent on Si concentration and on Si processing time. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
