#ITI#Adventitious rhizogenesis in Basilicum polystachyon (L.) Moench callus and HPLC analysis of phenolic acids#FTI#
#IRE#Key message: This is the successful report of adventitious rhizogenesis from leaf segment of in vitro grown Basilicum polystachyon (L.) Moench in MS medium supplemented with NAA and BAP. The presence of phenolic acids, viz., rosmarinic acid and p-coumaric acid in adventitious root extracts of rhizogenic callus is also a significant observation. Abstract: Rhizogenic callus was induced directly from the leaf segment explants of in vitro grown Basilicum polystachyon (L) Moench. Light green and compact callus with adventitious roots was induced on MS medium supplemented with 1 mg L−1 NAA and 1 mg L−1 BAP. MS medium with addition of 1.0 mg L−1 2,4-D and 1.0 mg L−1 BAP induced white and compact callus. Maximum callus induction efficiency (98%) was obtained in MS medium supplemented with NAA and BAP. The highest numbers of adventitious roots (24 ± 0.35) per callus were regenerated on MS medium supplemented with 1 mg L−1 of NAA and 1 mg L−1 of BAP. The adventitious root origination was studied with stereo-microscope and field emission scanning electron microscope. The induced rhizogenic callus was also a good source of phenolic acids. The presence of phenolic acids such as rosmarinic acid (10 µg/ml) and p-coumaric acid (14 µg/ml) in adventitious roots was determined by RP-HPLC analysis. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
