#ITI#Unraveling the inheritance pattern of yield and associated traits in Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.)#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, 56 F1 crosses of B. napus, including their eight parents, were developed through complete diallel mating design. Analysis of variances (ANOVA) of combining ability showed very highly significant (P ≤ 0.01) values for the general combining (GCA), specific combining (SCA) and the reciprocal combining ability (RCA) towards yield and its associated traits. Parental lines, AUP-9 (3.51), AUP-18 (37.26), AUP-20 (0.12), AUP-7 (0.11), and AUP-18 (5.66), were found as the best general combiners for each of the traits: pods on main raceme, pods on individual plant, seeds on each pod, 1000 seed weight and seed yield plant−1, respectively, whereas, based on desirable SCA effects, crosses found best were AUP-14 × AUP-18, AUP-14 × AUP-20, AUP-8 × AUP-20, AUP-2 × AUP-18, AUP-2 × AUP-14, and AUP-2 × AUP-9 for pods main raceme−1, pods plant−1, seeds pod−1, 1000 seed weight and seed yield plant−1, respectively. Superior reciprocal hybrids for economically important traits such as pods main raceme−1, pods plant−1, seeds pod−1, and seed yield plant−1 were AUP-17 × AUP-9, AUP-14 × AUP-2, AUP-18 × AUP-7 and AUP-20 × AUP-8, respectively, involving at least one best general combiner (parental line). Estimates of combining ability variances and predictability ratio (σ2GCA/σ2SCA <1.00) revealed the preponderance of a non-additive gene action and was further confirmed by higher values of variances due to SCA than GCA. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
