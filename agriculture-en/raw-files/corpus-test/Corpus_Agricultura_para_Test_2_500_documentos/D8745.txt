#ITI#Novel antimicrobial and antioxidative activity by endophytic Penicillium roqueforti and Trichoderma reesei isolated from Solanum surattense#FTI#
#IRE#Crop protection against phyto-pathogens has become a global challenge that can be tackled efficiently through natural resources, including endophytic fungi. Endophytes serve as a reservoir for the vast array of potent bioactive metabolites. We investigated the antioxidant and antibacterial potency of endophytes from the roots of Solanum surattense. The non-polar fraction of the cultural filtrate from the isolated strains was tried for antibacterial potency through agar plate diffusion assay. Among the isolated strains, Penicillium roqueforti (CGF-1) and Trichoderma reesei (CGF-11) had broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against phyto-pathogenic bacteria (Xanthomonas oryzae, Pseudomonas syringae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and Ralstonia solanacearum). The extracts of CGF-1 and CGF-11 achieved the best result against A. tumefaciens. Similarly, qualitative analysis of the ethyl acetate extracts P. roqueforti and T. reesei exposed the occurrence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, steroids, and tannins. HPLC analysis also confirmed the presence ferulic acid, cinnamic acid, quercetin, and rutin in the non-polar fraction of the cultural filtrate from the isolated strains. The results conclude that P. roqueforti and T. reesei can play an active role against the plant pathogens by secreting the bioactive compounds to protect host plant. Furthermore, the antibacterial and antioxidant potential of the P. roqueforti and T. reesei suggests its use in agriculture and pharmaceutical industry. © 2019, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
