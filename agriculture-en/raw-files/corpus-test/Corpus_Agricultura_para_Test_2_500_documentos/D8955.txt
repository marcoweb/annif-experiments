#ITI#Herbicidal effects of essential oils from selected plant species against common coffee (Coffea arabica L.) weed species#FTI#
#IRE#This study was designed to evaluate the inhibitory potential of plant extract and essential oils (EOs) extracted from Artemisia abyssinica, Cinnamomum verum, Cymbopogon citratus, C. martinii, C. winterianus, Curcuma longa, Cupressus lusitanica, Eucalyptus citriodora, E. globules, Lantana camara, Rosmarinus officinalis, and Thymus schimperi against some of the most troublesome weed species in the coffee field via a series of lath-house and field conditions using various application frequencies at the rate of 5% (v/v) arranged in RCBD with three replications. Our result showed that EOs significantly reduced the shoot height (58 to 100%) and root length (52 to 100%) as well as total biomass of G. parviflora seedlings compared to untreated control. The inhibitory effects were measured to be varied among EOs of the tested plants followed application frequencies dependent manner. The potential herbicidal properties of EOs from selected plants based on their efficacy in the lath-house experiments were further tested against weeds of coffee under the field. Except for EO from E. citriodora, all the tested materials showed strong inhibitory effects (ranging from 23.22 to 46.27%) on all weed species compared to untreated control. In conclusion, the application of EOs from Cymbopogon species had the potential to retard the growth of weeds in coffee and may be used as a component of integrated weed management options. However, further study needs to be done to investigate the mechanism of inhibition and the exact active ingredient responsible for the inhibitory effects. © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
