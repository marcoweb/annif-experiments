#ITI#Improving performance of olive trees by the enhancement of key physiological parameters of olive leaves in response to foliar fertilization#FTI#
#IRE#Most of the studies investigated the effects of nutrient-based fertilizers on olive fruits and oil quality; few studies have been interested in the modification of the chemical composition of olive leaves in response to fertilization. Thus, the current study aims to examine the effects of foliar fertilization on the mineral profile of olive leaves as well as the concentrations of chlorophyll, antioxidants (phenolic compounds) and carbohydrates. Experimentation consists of the annual application of six treatments during two successive growing seasons (2009–2010): TC (untreated trees), P1 (nitrogen-based fertilizer), P2 (contains boron, magnesium and manganese), P3 (phosphorus and potassium based fertilizer), P4 (rich in calcium and phosphorus), T5 (P1 and P2 application) and T6 (P1, P2, P3 and P4 application). At the end of the experiment, mineral analysis of olive leaves showed an increase in the concentrations of most nutrients which induced changes in biochemical composition: an increase of chlorophyll content, a reduction of total phenols and oleuropein concentrations coupled with an increase of hydroxytyrosol level. Moreover, an increase of total sugar content and most individual sugars, principally translocated forms of sugars (mannitol, sucrose and raffinose), was also observed. The accumulation of these key physiological parameters by foliar fertilization suggests an improvement of physiological performance and photosynthetic capacity of olive trees. Moreover, from a biological point of view, the results of the study revealed the possibility to improve plants of medicinal interest by enhancing the accumulation of some bio-active compounds, such as hydroxytyrosol and mannitol, via foliar nutrient supply. © Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków 2016.#FRE#
