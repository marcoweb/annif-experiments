#ITI#Identification for soybean host factors interacting with P3N-PIPO protein of Soybean mosaic virus#FTI#
#IRE#Previous evidence suggested the potyviral frame-shift protein P3N-PIPO is required for efficient viral intercellular movement. Host proteins are essential for virus to establish successful infection, many virus proteins play key roles in the viral infection cycle by interacting with that. Here, a yeast two-hybrid screening analysis was completed using Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) P3N-PIPO as the bait and a cDNA library from soybean infected with SMV as the prey to characterize the function of SMV P3N-PIPO. Fifty-four genes were isolated and analyzed by BLAST tools. Several genes encoding proteins that interacted with SMV P3N-PIPO were screened, including genes for inhibitory and transcription factors and those related to defense, transport, and photosynthesis. Some genes encoded proteins involved in metabolic activities in the chloroplast, such as photosystem I subunit PsaD and Calvin cycle protein CP12-2. Some genes were associated with defense responses, such as pathogenesis-related protein 1-like protein, stress-related protein-like protein, and stress enhanced protein 2. Other genes encoded defense-related transcription factors, such as WRKY transcription factor 51, while others were related to signal transduction, including a translationally-controlled tumor protein homolog, calcium-transporting ATPase 12, plasma membrane-type calcium-transporting ATPase 12-like protein, and calcineurin B-like protein 1-like isoform X1. Some genes coding for proteins related to affect viral plasmodesmata tracking, such as glucan endo-1,3-β-glucosidase (acidic isoform GL153). This study is the first to preliminarily delineate the interactions between SMV P3N-PIPO and host proteins related to defense responses during SMV infection. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
