#ITI#28-Homobrassinolide potential for oxidative interface in Brassica juncea under temperature stress#FTI#
#IRE#Exploration of scavenging potential of 28-homobrassinolide (28-homoBL) in mitigating the oxidative stress caused by free radicals (·O2         −, H2O2, ·NO, OH−) produced due to temperature stress (4, 44 °C) in Brassica juncea L. was made in the present research. Brassica juncea var. RLC-1 seeds were given pre-sowing soaking of different concentrations of 10−9 M 28-homoBL for 8 h. Seeds were sown in bedded petri plates lined with 10 No. What’s man filter paper under controlled laboratory conditions. Temperature of 4 and 44 °C, taken as low- and high-temperature stress, suppressed membrane stability and overall growth of the seedlings, while cell death was triggered. Accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and nitric oxide (NO) was boosted which resulted in enhanced oxidative stress on the 10th day after sowing. Activity level of antioxidant enzymes viz. superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPOX), and ascorbate peroxidase (APOX) was enhanced which was ensued for up-regulation of total antioxidant potential in 10-day-old plants exposed to negative effect of temperature stress. Priming treatment of 28-homoBL at seed level helped in maintaining the growth of seedlings to higher level as compared to only stressed as well as from control double distilled water-raised seedlings. 10−9 M 28-HBL found to be the best in enhancing the enzymatic activities of SOD, CAT, GPOX, and APOX and thus maintained antioxidant potential at higher level which accounted for alleviating oxidative stress caused due to extreme temperature stress. Dead cell formation reduced significantly in 28-homoBL-treated plants, membrane stability was upturned, while production of MDA, H2O2, and NO was under control. These results suggested and try to establish 28-homoBL as effective stress protector for B. juncea particularly from the oxidative damage induced by extreme temperatures. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
