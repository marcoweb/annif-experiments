#IRE#To determine whether differences in olive susceptibility to Verticillium dahliae are accompanied by differential biochemical and physiological defense responses, we monitored the changes in fungal DNA concentration, membrane conductivity, total polyphenols, orthodihydroxyphenols, lignin and defense-related enzymes in the stems and roots of two olive cultivars differing by their susceptibility to V. dahliae. Fungal DNA was detected in the roots at 4 dai and attains a pick of 3.614 and 2.475 ng/100 ng of total DNA, respectively, in the susceptible and resistant cultivars. V. dahliae DNA in the stems was detected from 15 dai and raised slowly to attain a pick of 0.231 ng/100 ng of total DNA in the susceptible cultivar. Correlation tests between the biochemical and physiological parameters revealed that high membrane conductivity, together with early activation of peroxidase (POX) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), resulted in a reduced root rot and wilt symptoms in the resistant cultivar Sayali when compared to the susceptible cultivar Chemlali. Monitoring of chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase genes’ expression levels indicates that early and simultaneous upregulation of both genes is correlated with reduced susceptibility in the resistant cultivar Sayali. Correlation tests performed between the different studied parameters, revealed a clear association between, POX activity and lignin content (r = 0.873), polyphenols and lignin contents (r = 0.886), PPO activity and OD phenols content (0.795), chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase activities (0.878) in the resistant cultivar Sayali. By contrast, lower correlation coefficients were obtained for the susceptible cultivar Chemlali. Overall, this study provides new insights into the improvement of olive genetic resources. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
