#ITI#Environmental conditions modulate plasticity in the physiological responses of three plant species of the Neotropical savannah#FTI#
#IRE#Plasticity in plants could be changed due to abiotic factors, tending to increase fitness across environments. In the Neotropical savannah, a strong water deficit during the dry season is one of the main factors limiting the plasticity in physiological responses of plants. The present study aims to assess the plasticity in physiological responses and vegetative phenology of three plant species of the Neotropical savannah (Cerrado in Brazil) during the dry and the rainy seasons. The three species, Byrsonima verbascifolia, Roupala montana, and Solanum lycocarpum, occur in Serra do Cipó in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The development and vegetative phenology of individuals of these three species were evaluated over the course of 1 year. In February 2012 (rainy season) and August 2012 (dry season), stomatal conductance (gs), water potential (Ψ), photosynthetic quantum yield, and concentration of leaf photosynthetic pigments were measured. The relative distance among the physiological parameters of all individuals within each season was measured using the relative distance plasticity index. B. verbascifolia has pronounced senescence in July and lost leaves completely by the early September, while R. montana and S. lycocarpum have green leaves throughout the year. The three studied species had greater control of stomatal opening during the dry season. S. lycocarpum and R. montana had negative water potential values in the dry season and in the middle of the day in both seasons. In the dry season, the three species exhibited a decrease in Fv/Fm, with values between 0.7 and 0.75. The relative distance plasticity index varied from 0 to 1. R. montana demonstrated the greatest plasticity and S. lycocarpum had lower plasticity. Then, a seasonal effect on physiological response was observed in all three model-species, with lower values for leaf water potential and stomatal conductance, and increased photoinhibition, in the dry season. Ecophysiological traits, such as stomatal conductance and leaf water potential, exhibited the greatest plasticity. In addition, there was a seasonal effect on the plasticity in physiological responses of the three plants species of the Neotropical savannah. The results are contradicting the idea that water restriction in the dry season would reduce the plasticity in most species of the Neotropical savannah. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
