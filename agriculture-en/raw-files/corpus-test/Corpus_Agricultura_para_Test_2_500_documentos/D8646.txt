#ITI#Putrescine application reduces softening and maintains the quality of pear fruit during cold storage#FTI#
#IRE#To enhance the storage potential of pear cv. Punjab Beauty fruit, the effect of putrescine (PUT) treatments was evaluated by analysing various physico-chemical characteristics and enzymatic activities. Postharvest dip treatments of PUT (1, 2 and 3 mM) were given to uniform and healthy fruit, while tap water was used for the control fruit. Treated fruit were stored at 0–1 °C and 90–95% RH for 75 days. Evaluation of fruit quality parameters was made on the 0th, 15th, 30th, 45th, 60th, 67th and 75th days of storage. The PUT treatments (2 and 3 mM) proved to be effective to diminish the softening and enhance the storage potential with acceptable quality. These treatments also suppressed the pectin methyl esterase and cellulase activity, reduced the weight loss and spoilage compared with control. Moreover, 2 and 3 mM PUT applications delayed colour changes, retained higher soluble solids content, starch content and titratable acidity at the end of storage than in control. These findings suggested that exogenous PUT application of 2 and 3 mM could effectively maintain fruit quality and prolong the storage potential of pear cv. Punjab Beauty fruit by reducing the softening during storage. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
