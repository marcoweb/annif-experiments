#ITI#Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of the lipoxygenase gene family during peach fruit ripening under different postharvest treatments#FTI#
#IRE#In plants, lipoxygenase (LOX), facilitated by the LOX family genes is closely related to fruit ripening and senescence, but research on LOX in peach fruit is limited. To study the roles of LOX family genes in fruit ripening during storage, a comprehensive overview of the LOX gene family in peach is presented, including their phylogenetic relationships, gene structures and subcellular localizations. Additionally, the fruit quality, including fruit firmness, ethylene production and soluble solids content under different storage conditions, were assessed. Finally, 12 peach genes that encode LOX proteins have been identified, and comparisons of the PpaLOX gene expression levels under different postharvest treatments in peach fruit suggest that PpaLOX2.1, PpaLOX7.1, PpaLOX7.2, and especially PpaLOX2.2, may be required in peach fruit ripening during storage. The results will be useful to further analyze the functions of the LOX family of genes in plants. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
