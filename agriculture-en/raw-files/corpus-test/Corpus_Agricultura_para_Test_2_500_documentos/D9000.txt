#ITI#Analysis of elements and bacosides in in vitro shoot culture of Bacopa monnieri#FTI#
#IRE#The experiments on Bacopa monnieri from Scrophulariaceae family were performed in in vitro shoot cultures conditions in media enriched with Mg ions and serine or anthranilic acid (L1 vitamin). As there is limited literature data available on the content of elements in shoots from B. monnieri in vitro cultures, analyses of magnesium, zinc, potassium, calcium, copper, sodium and iron in plant shoots constituted the aim of the present study. The next aim of the work, for the first time, consists of evaluation of the content and concentration of magnesium and other metals in in vitro shoot cultures of B. monnieri and their influence on bacoside levels, as well as establishment of interactions between the listed analytes. The highest accumulation of magnesium was determined in the plant tissues cultured in media doped with 0.1 g/L serine and 0.5 g/L Mg (2104 µg/g dry weight), and 0.5 mg/g of anthranilic acid and 1.0 g/L Mg (2163 µg/g). The highest concentration of bacosides in the obtained in vitro shoot cultures of B. monnieri (37.3 mg/g dry weight) was found in cultures of the following media composition: MS1 with addition of 0.25 g/L serine and 0.1 g/L Mg, and MS1 with addition of 0.5 g/L serine and 0.5 g/L magnesium. Considering the observed shortage of plant reserves in the natural environment and its curative properties, it seems to be of utmost importance to obtain, as a result of the presented experiment, in vitro shoot cultures of B. monnieri characterized by optimal and reproducible composition of the physiologically active elements and metabolites. © 2016, The Author(s).#FRE#
