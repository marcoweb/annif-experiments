#ITI#Morphophysiological and nutritional characteristics of Crambe abyssinica Hochst under hydric restriction in different phenological stages#FTI#
#IRE#Crambe is an oilseed whose oil is used mainly for biodiesel production, but crambe is still a developing agricultural crop. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to evaluate the growth and the physiological and nutritional parameters of Crambe abyssinica Hochst (crambe) cultivated under hydric restriction for 20 days. The experiment occurred in the greenhouse and consisted of comparing control and hydric restriction treatments for 20 days during the vegetative and flowering stages. The hydric restriction effect was evaluated by assessing plant height, the number of leaves, dry biomass and leaf area. The dry biomass and leaf area values were used to calculate physiological indexes such as the specific leaf area (SLA), leaf area ratio (LAR), liquid assimilation rate (LRA) and relative growth rate of the crop (RGR). The macro- and micronutrient leaf compositions were also analysed. The means were compared with those of the control according to the Dunnett test. A reduction leaf area and LAR as well as in the concentration of the minerals N, Ca, K, Mg and Zn was observed at the vegetative stage, whereas at flowering, the hydric restriction treatment reduced the SLA, LRA and Mg but increased the minerals K and Na. Thus, we conclude that there was an effect of hydric restriction on the morphological, physiological and nutritional characteristics of crambe plants on at least one of the phenological stages studied. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
