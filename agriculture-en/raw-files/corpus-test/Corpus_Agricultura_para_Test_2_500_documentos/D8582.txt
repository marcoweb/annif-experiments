#ITI#Norway spruce ecotypes distinguished by chlorophyll a fluorescence kinetics#FTI#
#IRE#Fast kinetics of chlorophyll a fluorescence in three Norway spruce ecotypes was investigated. Spruce ecotypes that come from different parts of the provenance regions were used to establish a common garden experiment in Central Bohemia (Czech Republic) in 1972. The hypothesis was based on the presumption that high-mountain spruce ecotype will benefit less from plain site compared to the mountain and lowland one after prolonged period of drought in 2018. FluorPen FP 110, spectrophotometer, and pressure chamber of Scholander type were used for fast kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence induction, chlorophyll content, and water potential measurement. With exception of selected structural parameters, quantum yield of photosystem II (φP0) values did not signify any kind of stress so did the performance index (PIABS) The experiment confirmed high adaption potential for high-mountain spruce ecotype planted in low elevations. © 2021, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
