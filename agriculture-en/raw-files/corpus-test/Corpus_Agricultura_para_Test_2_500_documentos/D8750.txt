#ITI#Role of lutoid membrane transport and protein synthesis in the regeneration mechanism of latex in different Hevea clones#FTI#
#IRE#Natural rubber (cis-1,4 polyisoprene) is synthesised in the milky cytoplasm, the latex, of specialized cells called laticifers in the bark tissues of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Regeneration mechanism of latex after each tapping (controlled wounding of the bark) was studied in relation to lutoid membrane enzymes and protein synthesis in twelve rubber clones with varying yield potentials during the peak rubber yielding season. High activity of membrane enzymes and better availability of biochemical energy [ATP] were observed in clones viz; RRII 105, RRIM 600, PB 260, RRII 422 and RRII 430. The highest protein biosynthetic capacity was noticed in clone PB 260 and RRIM 600. However, high ATP content, increased invertase activity and protein biosynthesis were observed in the medium yielding clone GT1 compared to clones with low rubber yield potential. Very low sugar content and increased invertase activity in the latex of clone PB 260 indicated intense latex metabolism with high protein turnover that implies fast recouping of the cellular metabolites lost during latex harvesting. Clone PB 217 was characterized by very high sucrose and low ATP concentration and ATPase activity in latex indicating slow metabolism and hence be suitable for inducing latex metabolism using ethylene stimulant. Low rubber yielding clones such as RRII 33 and RRII 38 were consistently recorded a high sucrose content but very low activity of membrane enzymes, reduced ATP concentration and low protein biosynthesis in latex. Among the recently released modern clones (RRII 400 series), latex regeneration capacity was higher in RRII 422 and RRII 430. The significance of lutoid membrane transport and protein synthesis is discussed in relation to general latex metabolism of these rubber clones. The outcome of this study would be helpful to design suitable latex harvesting systems and yield stimulation methods for optimizing latex production in each clone based on metabolic profiling. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
