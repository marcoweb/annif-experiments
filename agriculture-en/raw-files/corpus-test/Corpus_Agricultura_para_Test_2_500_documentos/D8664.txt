#ITI#Response to strigolactone treatment in chrysanthemum axillary buds is influenced by auxin transport inhibition and sucrose availability#FTI#
#IRE#Axillary bud outgrowth is regulated by both environmental cues and internal plant hormone signaling. Central to this regulation is the balance between auxins, cytokinins, and strigolactones. Auxins are transported basipetally and inhibit the axillary bud outgrowth indirectly by either restricting auxin export from the axillary buds to the stem (canalization model) or inducing strigolactone biosynthesis and limiting cytokinin levels (second messenger model). Both models have supporting evidence and are not mutually exclusive. In this study, we used a modified split-plate bioassay to apply different plant growth regulators to isolated stem segments of chrysanthemum and measure their effect on axillary bud growth. Results showed axillary bud outgrowth in the bioassay within 5 days after nodal stem excision. Treatments with apical auxin (IAA) inhibited bud outgrowth which was counteracted by treatments with basal cytokinins (TDZ, zeatin, 2-ip). Treatments with basal strigolactone (GR24) could inhibit axillary bud growth without an apical auxin treatment. GR24 inhibition of axillary buds could be counteracted with auxin transport inhibitors (TIBA and NPA). Treatments with sucrose in the medium resulted in stronger axillary bud growth, which could be inhibited with apical auxin treatment but not with basal strigolactone treatment. These observations provide support for both the canalization model and the second messenger model with, on the one hand, the influence of auxin transport on strigolactone inhibition of axillary buds and, on the other hand, the inhibition of axillary bud growth by strigolactone without an apical auxin source. The inability of GR24 to inhibit bud growth in a sucrose treatment raises an interesting question about the role of strigolactone and sucrose in axillary bud outgrowth and calls for further investigation. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
