#ITI#Effects of mycorrhizal fungi inoculation and soil amendment with hydrogel on leaf anatomy, growth and physiology performance of olive plantlets under two contrasting water regimes#FTI#
#IRE#Abiotic stresses present a real environmental problem in agriculture field. In our paper, we examine the significance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and soil amendment with water retaining superpolymers (hydrogel) on growth and physiology performance of olive plantlets. Our experiment was carried out in nursery conditions, to test the impact of hydrogel (TH) and mycorrhizal fungi (TM), used individually or combined (THM), and compare them with non inoculated plants (TC), to understand and reduce the water stress damage in olive plantlets (cv. Chemlali). We also evaluate interactions between hydrogel, mycorrhizal treatments and water regimes. Results of mycorrhization (M%) show that roots colonized by Rhizophagus irregularis of well-watered plants were about 40.87%. In combined treatment (THM), M% was about 32.14%. Compared to TC treatment, TM treatment enhances significantly the dry weights of the whole plant under the two water regimes. The TM treatment had the highest relative water content (66.50%) and Chl (a + b) (0.83 mg g− 1) in stressed conditions. We found also that under water stress, the maximal quantum efficiency of the photosystem II measurements in leaves were significantly improved by 50.70% in TH treatment compared to control. For phenolic contents, TH treatment decreased significantly total phenols by 50.10% compared to TC. Our study gives evidence that the use of AMF and the hydrogel separately or in combination may enhance the capacity to avoid drought damages of olive plantlets and improve olive performances. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
