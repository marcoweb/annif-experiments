#ITI#Antioxidative response of Arabidopsis thaliana to combined action of low temperature and high light illumination when lutein is missing#FTI#
#IRE#Plants of Arabidopsis thaliana, wt and lut2, mutant that do not contain lutein, were subjected to combined treatment with two stress factors, low temperature and high light illumination for 6 days. The extent of suffered oxidative stress was evaluated by the content of H2O2 and level of lipid peroxidation. The stress-induced alterations in the content of non-enzymatic (carotenoids, anthocyanins and ascorbate) and enzymatic (superoxide dismutase—SOD, ascorbate peroxidase—APX and catalase—CAT) antioxidants were evaluated. A remarkable increase of H2O2 content, lipid peroxidation, anthocyanins and ascorbate amount and activities of scavenging enzymes was registered after 6 days of combined action with two stress factors. The higher activity of CAT and level of anthocyanins and ascorbate at the longest period of exposure to two stress factors in lut2 indicate that the mutant needed higher antioxidant support when compared with wt. During the recovery period, the stress-generated H2O2 remained high but the three antioxidant enzymes were able to control the content of ROS and to prevent membrane damage. The most effective enzyme, scavenging of H2O2 in wt plants was APX, while for lut2 plants the most effective was CAT. Anthocyanins and ascorbate also contributed to the antioxidative defense strategy against combined stress, more pronounced in lut2 plants. © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
