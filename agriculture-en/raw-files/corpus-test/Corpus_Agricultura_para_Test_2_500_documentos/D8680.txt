#ITI#Morphological, physiological and biochemical adaptations of Eucalyptus citriodora seedlings under NaCl stress in hydroponic conditions#FTI#
#IRE#Salinity stress could be managed by the growth of economically important tree species. Adaptations of Eucalyptus citriodora to NaCl stress was investigated under different concentrations of NaCl (15–75 mM). After 2 and 6 months of treatments, data were recorded for growth performance (shoot and root length, leaf number and area), physiological attributes [chlorophylla (Chla), chlorophyllb (Chlb), total chlorophyll (TC), carotenoids, relative water content (RWC)] and osmolyte accumulation [proline, glycine betaine (GB) and trehalose] parameters. After 2 months, changes in morphological parameters of treated plants were negligible (1–1.8-folds) in comparison to control, which is correlated with 2–8-, 1.12–7.7- and 1.73–3.94-folds increase in GB, proline and trehalose contents, respectively. At 6 months, though there was plant mortality, 70–80 % decrease in TC contents and reduction in osmolyte contents but 20 % increase in RWC of stressed plants were monitored. Survival at higher salt concentrations with accumulation of sodium shows significant salt tolerance in this species. © 2015, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
