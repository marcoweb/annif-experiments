#IRE#Key message: The immature seeds of Dendrobium nobile acquire resistance to freezing and long-term storage in a cryobank at the age of 6 months after pollination. Abstract: Seed maturation of Dendrobium nobile Lindl to establish the optimal stage for long-term storage of immature seeds in liquid nitrogen was studied. Immature seeds can germinate in vitro starting from 3 months after pollination (MAP) but only develop up to the stage of embryo swelling or protocorm without rhizoids. The maximum staining of embryos with vital dyes FDA and TTC occurs at 4 and 5 MAP that corresponds to the release of suspensor beyond the embryo sac. Embryo staining does not correlate with germination capacity and seed viability in cryogenic storage. The immature seeds acquire resistance to drying in airflow and cryostorage at the age of 6 MAP. 11% of seeds germinated after cryogenic storage at 6 MAP, and 81–94% at 7–10 MAP. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
