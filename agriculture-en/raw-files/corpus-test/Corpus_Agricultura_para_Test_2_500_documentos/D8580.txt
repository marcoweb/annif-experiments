#ITI#Transcriptomic analysis reveals ethylene’s regulation involved in adventitious roots formation in lotus (Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn.)#FTI#
#IRE#Adventitious roots (ARs) play an irreplaceable role in the uptake of water and nutrients due to under-developed principle root in plants. The process of ARs formation is affected by plant hormone. In this study, by employing High-Throughout Tag-sequencing Technique and ELISA method, we analyzed of the transcriptome and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content to monitor the changes of metabolism regulated by ethylene signaling in lotus. Exogenous application of ethephon (ethylene precursor) dramatically accelerated ARs development, and while restrained by 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP, the ethylene perception inhibitor), indicating the crucial role ethylene in ARs development. Transcriptomic analysis showed that both treatment of ethephon and 1-MCP dramatically altered the expression of numerous genes. In total, transcriptional expressions of 694 genes were induced and 554 genes were suppressed in ETH/CK0 stages compared with MCP/CK0 stages. Most of these up-regulated genes exhibited the one-three folds changes. In ETH/MCP libraries, we found nine and five genes involved in the metabolism or transcriptional responses to ethylene and IAA, and fourteen genes, which were considered to NAC, bHLH, AP2-EREBP, MYB, LOB, bHLH and bZIP families, respectively, exhibited an increase in transcriptional level. In addition, an enhanced mRNA levels of seven genes [1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO), leucine-rich repeat receptor, pectinesterase, pyruvate decarboxylase, ethylene oxide synthase, respiratory burst oxidase homolog protein and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase] relevant to ARs formation were detected in was detected in ETH/MCP libraries. Furthermore, we found that IAA content was obviously decreased after applications were detected on ethephon and 1-MCP. However, the decreased IAA level in 1-MCP treatment was more pronounced than that in ethephon treatment, and kept a low level during the whole periods of ARs development. Taken together, our findings provided a comprehensive understanding of ethylene’s regulation during ARs formation in lotus seedlings. © 2019, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
