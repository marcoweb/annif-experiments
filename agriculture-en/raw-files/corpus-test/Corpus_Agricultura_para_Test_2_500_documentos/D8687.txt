#ITI#The combined treatment of Mn and Al alleviates the toxicity of Al or Mn stress alone in barley#FTI#
#IRE#Aluminum (Al) and manganese (Mn) toxicity commonly coexists in acid soil, so the crop cultivars suitable for planting in acid soil should show high tolerance to both elements simultaneously. However, it is still not clear if the toxicity of Mn and Al on plant growth is antagonistic or synergistic, and the plants with Al tolerance are also tolerant to Mn toxicity. In this study, three barley genotypes (one Tibetan wild and two cultivated), differing in Al tolerance, were characterized for growth and physiological responses to Al or Mn toxicity as well as the combined treatment of the two toxic elements. Interestingly, it has been found that the combined treatment of both metals was less affected in comparison with Al or Mn treatment alone, in terms of plant growth, Al or Mn concentration in plant tissues, and photosynthetic parameters, indicating antagonistic interaction of Al and Mn for their effect on plant growth and physiological traits. The results also showed that there was a dramatic difference among barley genotypes in Mn toxicity tolerance and XZ16 showed much higher tolerance than other two genotypes. High Mn tolerance is mainly described to less Mn uptake and lower Mn concentration in plants, and Mn tolerance is independent of Al tolerance. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
