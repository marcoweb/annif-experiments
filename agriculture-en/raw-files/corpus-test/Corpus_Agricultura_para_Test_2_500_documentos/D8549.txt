#ITI#The involvement of TsFtsH8 in Thellungiella salsuginea tolerance to cold and high light stresses#FTI#
#IRE#Thellungiella salsuginea is a plant that commonly grows in harsh environments of salinity and low temperature. Although the molecular mechanism underlying salt tolerance in T. salsuginea has been extensively explored, our understanding of how this species tolerates cold stress is limited. In a previous study, Wong et al. (2006) identified a cold-inducible TsFtsH8 gene in T. salsuginea. Based on the role of AtFtsH in D1 protein turnover and in maintaining the normal function of photosystem II, we hypothesized that TsFtsH8 might be related to cold tolerance in T. salsuginea. In the present study, RNAi lines of TsFtsH8 were generated and its tolerance to cold was evaluated. The results showed that in early spring, TsFtsH8-RNAi lines underwent leaf variegation, severe chlorophyll decomposition, organelle deterioration, decrease in the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and in the proportion of open photosystem II reaction centers (qP), and incomplete degradation of the 23 kDa fragment of the D1 protein. These findings suggest that TsFtsH8 is involved in the development of T. salsuginea in the early spring. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
