#ITI#Responsiveness comparison of three stress inducible promoters in transgenic rice#FTI#
#IRE#Although dozens of stress inducible promoters have been identified in rice, detailed and comparative investigations under uniform condition are still limited. In this study, we selected eight previously reported drought-inducible genes [Oshox24, hypothetical protein (hp), OsLEA3-1, OsNAC5, OsNCED3, Rab21, RRJ1 and Wsi18] and analyzed their transcriptional responses to drought and osmotic stresses in rice. Based on their transcription patterns and the required standards for inducible promoters, Oshox24, Rab21 and OsLEA3-1 were chosen for cloning of their promoters for detailed analyses at both the RNA and protein/activity levels, with rice oxalate oxidase gene (OsOxO3) as a reporter gene. By generating transgenic plants and determining oxalate oxidase activity that is activated under different stresses, we defined more quantitatively that the promoters of Oshox24, OsLEA3-1 and Rab21 are ideally applicable to transgene expression for inducibly controlling drought resistance genes or other functional genes in rice. The results provided a quantitative assessment of the strength, sensitivity, stress specificity and time course of the three promoters. Such detailed information is essential for the selection of promoters for use in improving stress resistance. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
