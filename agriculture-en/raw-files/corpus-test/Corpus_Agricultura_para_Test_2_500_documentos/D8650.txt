#ITI#The effect of abscisic acid on cold tolerance and chloroplasts ultrastructure in wheat under optimal and cold stress conditions#FTI#
#IRE#The effect of abscisic acid (0.1 mM) on cold tolerance of leaf cells and ultrastructure of chloroplasts in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under optimal (22 °C) and cold stress conditions (4 °C) was studied. Results indicated that exogenous abscisic acid induces a rise in the cold tolerance of wheat along with a number of significant ultrastructural changes in chloroplasts both at 22 and at 4 °C. Some of them (increase in density of chloroplasts stroma, formation of “distorted” and “dilated” thylakoids, appearance of invaginations, changes in the shape of chloroplasts and increase of their dimension owing to the stroma area) were common to the two types of treatments. At the same time, the character of changes in the membrane system of plastids was temperature specific, i.e. if at 22 °C the hormone caused a considerable increase in the length of photosynthetic membranes in chloroplast owing the length of both appressed and non-appressed membranes of thylakoids, then in cold stress conditions observed an increase in the number of grana and the length of appressed membranes of thylakoids. These results suggested that the rise in the cold tolerance of abscisic acid-treated plants is associated with the ultrastructural reorganization of chloroplasts aimed to defense plant cells against chilling injury and to maintain the activity of the photosynthetic system. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
