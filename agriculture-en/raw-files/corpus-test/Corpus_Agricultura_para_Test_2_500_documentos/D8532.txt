#ITI#Selenium nano-particle induced alterations in expression patterns of heat shock factor A4A (HSFA4A), and high molecular weight glutenin subunit 1Bx (Glu-1Bx) and enhanced nitrate reductase activity in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Taking account of heat shock factor A4A (HSFA4A) as a hydrogen peroxide sensor, anti-apoptosis agent, and crosslink component with critical signaling cascades, the current study was carried out to monitor possible changes in expression of this gene as well as some other important characteristics in wheat plants exposed to selenium nano-particle (nSe). Wheat seedlings were treated with nSe (0, 5, 10, and 50 mgl−1). In germinating stage, plant fresh weights were reduced in nSe-treated seedlings, among which the nSe of 50 provoked roots turned brown. The nSe triggered the increases in the expressions of HSFA4A, in the plate. In the pot condition, shoot fresh weights in nSe-supplemented seedlings were decreased by approximately 22%. The nSe of 5 and 10 mgl−1, respectively induced the expression of HSFA4A by 3.4- and 9.15-folds, contrasted with nSe50. Increasing times of sprays caused the dramatic reductions of the expression of HSFA4A in the nSe-supplemented groups. Moreover, the treatment of nSe stimulated expression of high molecular weight glutenin subunit 1Bx (Glu-1Bx) by fourfold, over the control. While the dramatic decrease in the expression of Glu-1Bx was recorded with increasing times of spray. Nitrate reductase activities were significantly improved by approximately 47% in nSe-fortified seedlings. Also, the foliar supplementation of nSe of 5 mgl−1 provoked the significant inductions in peroxidase activity by 8%, whereas two other nSe treatments declined it. It may be stated that the nSe may modify the expression of HSFA4A, thereby triggering specific signaling and altering metabolism. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
