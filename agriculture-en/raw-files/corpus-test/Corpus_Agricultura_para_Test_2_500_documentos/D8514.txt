#ITI#Identification and comparative analysis of Brassica juncea pathogenesis-related genes in response to hormonal, biotic and abiotic stresses#FTI#
#IRE#Pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) are the antimicrobial proteins which are commonly used as signatures of defense signaling pathways and systemic acquired resistance. However, in Brassica juncea most of the PR proteins have not been fully characterized and remains largely enigmatic. In this study, full-length cDNA sequences of SA (PR1, PR2, PR5) and JA (PR3, PR12 and PR13) marker genes were isolated from B. juncea and were named as BjPR proteins. BjPR proteins showed maximum identity with known PR proteins of Brassica species. Further, expression profiling of BjPR genes were investigated after hormonal, biotic and abiotic stresses. Pre-treatment with SA and JA stimulators downregulates each other signature genes suggesting an antagonistic relationship between SA and JA in B. juncea. After abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, SA signatures were downregulated while as JA signature genes were upregulated. During Erysiphe cruciferarum infection, SA- and JA-dependent BjPR genes showed distinct expression pattern both locally and systemically, thus suggesting the activation of SA- and JA-dependent signaling pathways. Further, expression of SA marker genes decreases while as JA-responsive genes increases during drought stress. Interestingly, both SA and JA signature genes were induced after salt stress. We also found that BjPR genes displayed ABA-independent gene expression pattern during abiotic stresses thus providing the evidence of SA/JA cross talk. Further, in silico analysis of the upstream regions (1.5 kb) of both SA and JA marker genes showed important cis-regulatory elements related to biotic, abiotic and hormonal stresses. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
