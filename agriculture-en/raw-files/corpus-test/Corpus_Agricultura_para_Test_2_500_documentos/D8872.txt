#IRE#Guava is an important tropical and subtropical climacteric fruit rich in vitamin C. At ambient conditions, the fruit cannot be stored for a long period due to fast ripening, abrupt softening and fungal growth. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of postharvest sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment, a nitric oxide donor, on senescence and physicochemical quality of guava fruit. Mature-green fruits were given immersion treatment of sodium nitroprusside (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mM) for 5 min while, fruits under control were dipped in distilled water for the same duration. After the treatment, fruits were stored at ambient condition (20 ± 3 °C). Among the treatments, the best result with minimum weight loss (16.31%) and decay loss (22.22%) after 12 days of storage was noted in 1.0 mM SNP-treated fruits. Malondialdehyde content of fruits under this treatment also showed minimum increase of 5.3-fold indicating delayed senescence, as compared to control and other SNP-treated fruits. Fruits under this treatment exhibited delayed ripening, resulting minimum loss (53.23%) of chlorophyll, and slower increase in carotenoid pigments. Prestorage treatment of guava with SNP (1.0 mM) presented minimum loss of total soluble solids and acidity as compared to control fruits. The loss in ascorbic acid (21.30%), phenols (22.25%), flavonoids (26.14%), antioxidant capacity (25.61%), and radical scavenging activity (34.21%) was minimum in guava fruits treated with 1.0 mM SNP. The study indicated that storage life of guava at ambient condition can be prolonged by postharvest immersion treatment of 1.0 mM SNP. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
