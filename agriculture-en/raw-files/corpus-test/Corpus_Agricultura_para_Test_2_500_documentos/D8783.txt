#ITI#Effects of potassium deficiency on the enzymatic changes in developing cotton fibers#FTI#
#IRE#Although effects of potassium (K) on cotton growth have been explored extensively, the effects of K deficiency on the physiological changes closely related to cotton fiber development are lacking. Thus, a 2-year field experiment was conducted with two cotton cultivars (Simian 3 and Siza 3) under 0 kg K2O ha−1 (K deficiency) and 300 kg K2O ha−1 (K sufficiency). The results showed that tonoplast adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase), pyrophosphatase (PPase), plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PM H+-ATPase), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), sucrose synthesis (SuSy) and vacuolar invertase (V-INV) were highly sensitive to K deficiency. The decreases in those enzymes resulted in low malate and soluble sugar contents, which together with low K concentration declined the driving force for fiber elongation, leading to significantly lower fiber length in the 0 kg K2O ha−1 treatment. The activity of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) was obviously increased by K deficiency before 20 days post anthesis (DPA), which could partly explain the acceleration of fiber cellulose synthesis and the increase in fiber strength in the 0 kg K2O ha−1 treatment in the early stage. However, SPS activity was decreased by K deficiency after 20 DPA and SuSy activity was reduced by K deficiency at any sampling date, resulting in low fiber strength in the end. Compared with Simian 3, the enzymes V-ATPase, PPase, PM H+-ATPase, PEPC and SuSy during fiber elongation stage were more sensitive to K deficiency in Siza 3, and the enzymes SuSy and SPS during fiber-thickening stage were more sensitive to K deficiency in Siza 3, which were the important reasons causing greater decreases in final fiber length and final fiber strength for Siza 3 than Simian 3 under K deficiency. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
