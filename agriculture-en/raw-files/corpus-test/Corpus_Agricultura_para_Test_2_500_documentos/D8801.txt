#ITI#Identification of salt-induced transcripts by suppression subtractive hybridization and their expression analysis under the combination of salt and elevated CO2 conditions in Salicornia brachiata#FTI#
#IRE#Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress that affects global agricultural productivity. Exploring the mechanisms that halophytes employ to thrive and flourish under saline environments is essential to increase the salt tolerance in sensitive crop species. Of the three halophytes used in this study Salicornia brachiata and Suaeda maritima belong to the same family Chenopodiaceae, while Sesuvium portulacastrum, a mangrove-associated halophyte, belongs to the family Aizoaceae. Assuming that halophytes of same family share similar salt tolerance mechanisms, we generated a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH1) cDNA library from salt-treated leaf tissues of S. brachiata as tester and that of S. maritima as driver to identify salt-responsive genes unique to S. brachiata. To elucidate the difference in salt-tolerance mechanisms, and to identify salt-tolerance mechanisms amongst different families of halophytes, SSH2 library was generated from salt-treated leaf tissue of S. brachiata as tester and that of S. portulacastrum as driver. Totally, 87 and 49 EST clones representing unique genes were obtained from SSH1 and SSH2 libraries, respectively. Examination of the expression patterns of 17 (SSH1) and 15 (SSH2) differentially expressed genes using semi-quantitative RT-PCR confirmed up-regulation of these genes in shoots in response to salt treatment and elevated CO2 condition, but to a different extent. This study has provided insights into the molecular responses of S. brachiata to salt stress and elevated CO2 conditions. © 2018, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
