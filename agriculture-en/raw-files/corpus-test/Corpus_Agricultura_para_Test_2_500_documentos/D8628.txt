#ITI#The role of gibberellins and auxin on the tomato cell layers in pericarp via the expression of ARFs regulated by miRNAs in fruit set#FTI#
#IRE#Phytohormones, such as auxin (IAA) and gibberellin (GA), are known to be essential for fruit development. We utilized GA-deficient (gib-3) and diageotropica (dgt) tomato mutants to elucidate the effects of single hormones in the pericarp. The application of IAA or GA, respectively, to gib-3 or dgt single mutants induced a significant morphological difference in the fruit set. We found that IAA application induced cell division in the gib-3 pericarp and that GA application did not increase the cell layers in the dgt pericarp. In molecular studies, the expression levels of SlARF6, SlARF8, SlARF10 and SlARF16 were downregulated by IAA application, whereas the expression of their regulators miRNA160 and miRNA167 was upregulated by IAA application in gib-3 plants. Furthermore, the expression levels of SlARF6, SlARF8, SlARF10 and SlARF16 were upregulated by GA application, whereas the expression levels of miRNAs were reduced in the dgt mutant. These results imply that the expression levels of SlARF6, SlARF8, SlARF10 and SlARF16 were negatively correlated with the number of cell layers in the pericarp during fruit set. To further support this hypothesis, 35s:mSlARF10 transgenic plants resistant to SlmiR160 cleavage of SlARF10 mRNA were used to investigate the cell layers in fruit. These results revealed that mSlARF10 overexpression indeed resulted in fewer cell layers than in wild type fruit. Together, our data suggest that GA- and IAA-mediated miRNAs and their target ARFs influence the formation of pericarp cell layers during fruit set development. © 2016, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
