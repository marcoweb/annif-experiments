#ITI#Enhancement of paclitaxel content in induced tetraploid Corylus avellana L. cell suspension culture with regulating the expression of genes in paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway#FTI#
#IRE#During recent years, hazel cell suspension culture has been significantly considered as a new important source of paclitaxel. Artificial polyploidy alters different characters in plants which results in amplifying the secondary metabolites in medicinal plants. In this paper, the effects of tetraploidy induction on paclitaxel content and gene expression in hazel cell suspension culture were investigated. Various concentrations of colchicine and duration of exposure in solid and liquid media were examined and the ploidy level of cells was determined using flow cytometric analysis. The tetraploid cells were obtained from 0.2% colchicine in the exposure time of 5 and 6 days in solid medium and 0.3% colchicine in the exposure time of 3 and 4 days in liquid medium. Tetraploid cells were employed to prepare cell suspension. 3 µM of phenylalanine and 0.05 mM of vanadyl sulfate were added to both tetraploid and diploid (control) suspension to elicit paclitaxel induction. High performance liquid chromatography analysis demonstrated that the tetraploid cell suspensions produced paclitaxel of about [9.88 µg g−1 (DW)] 1.7-fold compared with diploid cells [5.74 µg g−1 (DW)]. The application of phenylalanine and vanadyl sulfate increased the concentration of paclitaxel in both diploid and tetraploid cells. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of GGPPS gene was significantly increased and PAL gene expression was altered after tetraploidization. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
