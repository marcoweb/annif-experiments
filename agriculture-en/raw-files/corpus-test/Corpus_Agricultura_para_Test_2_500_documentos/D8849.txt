#ITI#Seasonal and micro-environmental factors controlling clonal propagation of mature trees of marwar teak [Tecomella undulata (Sm.) Seem]#FTI#
#IRE#A simple method has been developed for clonal propagation of mature trees of Tecomella undulata (Sm.) Seem, a medicinally important deciduous timber tree of hot arid regions, via multiple shoot proliferation from axillary buds after examining the role of season influences and physico–chemical conditions on micropropagation. Spring season (March–April) was the best period for contamination free establishment of explants and maximum sprouting of healthy axillary buds. Shoots proliferated directly from the explant nodes cultured on Murashige and Skoog’s medium containing cytokinins, BAP supporting better growth compared to kinetin during shoot induction as well as multiplication phase. Cytokinin concentration influenced the bud induction frequency and optimal response of 2.6 buds per explant was achieved in 86.66% explants on media supplemented with 10 µM BAP. Stunted shoot buds with excessive callus were observed when cytokinin concentration was increased beyond optimal levels. Ascorbic acid (50 mg/l), arginine and citric acid (25 mg/l each) were added to proliferation and multiplication media for reducing callus proliferation and better shoot growth. Among the media (B5, MS, NN, WPM and SH) tested, SH was best for shoot multiplication. Shoot cultures were multiplied by regular subculture of axillary shoots on SH medium containing 5.0 µM each of BAP and kinetin. Shoots produced roots when cultured on ½× SH medium + 10 μM IBA. Regenerated plantlets were successfully transferred to field after hardening and acclimatization. Genetic homogeneity of tissue culture raised plants was confirmed by generation of monomorphic DNA fragments with Start codon targeted and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. © 2017, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
