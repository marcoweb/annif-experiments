#ITI#Morpho-physiological and biochemical changes in black gram (Vigna mungo L. Hepper) genotypes under drought stress at flowering stage#FTI#
#IRE#The response of drought stress on morpho-physiological and biochemical characters was assessed in black gram genotypes in a pot culture experiment. Water stress was applied at flowering stage of the crop and various morpho-physiological and biochemical characters were analyzed under control and water stress conditions. The genotypes, water levels and their interaction varied significantly for majority of the traits quantified revealing the presence of substantial genetic diversity. Based on these studies, genotypes PGRU95016, COBG05, IPU99209, IPU941 and IPU243 were identified as tolerant to drought stress conditions. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, total chlorophyll, proline content and peroxidase activity could be useful to screen for drought tolerance in black gram. © 2019, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
