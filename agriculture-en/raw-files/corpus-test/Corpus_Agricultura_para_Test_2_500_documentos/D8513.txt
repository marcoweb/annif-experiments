#ITI#Antioxidant response of wheat to tire rubber ash and ZnO nanoparticles and ionic zinc exposure in nutrient solution culture#FTI#
#IRE#This study aimed to investigate oxidative stress and antioxidant response of wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Back Cross Rushan) after treatment with different zinc (Zn) concentrations i.e., 0.1 (control), 10, 100 and 300 µM Zn in the form of Zn-sulfate and nanoparticles of waste tire rubber ash (RA NPs) and zinc oxide (ZnO NPs). Both zinc deficiency and excess conditions caused significant increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the plant leaves and the highest level MDA concentration was observed in the leaves of plants treated with Zn-sulfate. Increasing Zn level significantly increased catalase (CAT) activity under Zn-sulfate and ZnO NPs treatments. Activity of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) was increased by elevating Zn level up to 100 μM and then it was decreased at the 300 μM level. A significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was observed both under zinc deficiency (0.1 μM) and excess conditions (100 and 300 μM). The highest shoot Zn concentration was found at the 300 µM Zn level, applied as Zn-sulfate which significantly reduced the plant biomass. In general, the toxic effects were higher under ionic Zn (Zn-sulfate) treatment than that under nanoparticles treatments, suggesting that the toxicity was due to released Zn2+ ions. The nanoparticles of waste tire rubber ash are a clean source of Zn for application in Zn-deficient calcareous soils. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
