#ITI#Seed priming with gibberellic acid rescues chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) from chilling stress#FTI#
#IRE#Chickpea is sensitive to low temperature stress, especially during germination and stand establishment. Present study was planned to rescue the chickpea seedlings from chilling stress through seed priming with gibberellic acid. A study comprising of two chickpea cultivars (cv.) viz. Çağatay (a chilling tolerant cultivar: CTC) and Akçin (a chilling sensitive cultivar: CSC) in combination with 0, hydropriming, 5 µM, 10 µM, 15 µM, 20 µM gibberellic acid (GA3) seed priming treatments was tested in completely randomized design under chilling temperature. Primed and unprimed seeds were sown at 9 ± 0.5 °C day temperature for 14 h and 7 ± 0.5 °C night temperatures for 10 h. Final emergence percentage (FEP) in both cultivars was noted higher in 10 µM GA3 seed priming. Coefficient of uniformity of emergence (CUE) was increased and time taken to 50% emergence (E50) was shorten with the application of 5 or 15 µM GA3. Mean emergence time (MET) was reduced in both cultivars in 20 µM GA3 seed treatment. Emergence energy (EE) and emergence index (EI) of CTC were increased in 15 µM GA3. In CSC 5 µM GA3, seed treatment was most productive treatment under low temperature. Higher doses of GA3 seed treatments in CSC were proved very effective in maintaining high relative water contents and low electrolyte leakage. Plant height, root length and number of flowers were also increased in GA3 primed treatments. In conclusion, seed priming with GA3 can be used in chickpea for good stand establishment, crop growth, reducing electrolyte leakage and maintaining high relative water contents. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
