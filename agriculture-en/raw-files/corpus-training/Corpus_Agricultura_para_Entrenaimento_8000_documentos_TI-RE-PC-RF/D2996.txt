#ITI#Estimation of correlation coefficient among yield and attributing traits of field pea (Pisum sativum l.)#FTI#
#IRE#In order to best exploit the available genetic wealth in the crop, the information would have paramount important. Therefore, this study was conceived to examine the variability and determines the relative importance of primary and secondary traits as selection criteria to improve productivity. Field pea (Pisum sativum L. var. arvense) is amongst the most important legume crop of India. The experimental material comprised of 120 field pea germplasm including 40 indigenous and 10 exotic collections of pea and 4 check varieties viz., HUDP-15, HFP-4, HUP-2, Rachna. Five competitive plants from each plot were randomly selected for recording observations for all the quantitative characters except days to 50 per cent flowering and days to maturity, which were recorded on line basis. In present study a strong and positive association of seed yield per plant observed with harvest index, biological yield per plant, plant height, number of seeds per pod, number of primary branches per plant, number of pods per plant and 100-seed weight. Days to maturity and number of seeds per pod showed positive correlation with days to 50 per cent flowering and number of primary branches per plant respectively. Days to maturity and 100-seed weight and number of pods per plant showed weak association with seed yield per plant in positive direction. Thus, these characters emerged as most vital component traits and associated positively with seed yield per plant. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
