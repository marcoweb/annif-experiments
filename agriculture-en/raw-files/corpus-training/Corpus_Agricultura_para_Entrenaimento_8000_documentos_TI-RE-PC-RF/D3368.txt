#ITI#Influence of Temperature and Daylight Length on Barley Infection by Pyrenophora Teres#FTI#
#IRE#Net blotch caused by Pyrenophora teres is the most important disease of barley in many regions in which this cereal is cultivated. In the performed work the influence of solarization period and temperature on infection of barley by P. teres was estimated. Three isolates of each P. teres f. teres and P. teres f. maculata were used. The response of six barley genotypes to the pathogen was estimated. Barley infection was differentiated and depended on solarization period, and the isolate of P. teres. Number of infected plants increased with the increase of temperature. Interaction occurred among length of solarization period and temperature. The highest barley infection by P. teres f. teres was observed at 10 hours of solarization and temperature 25°C. © 2008, Versita. All rights reserved.#FRE#
