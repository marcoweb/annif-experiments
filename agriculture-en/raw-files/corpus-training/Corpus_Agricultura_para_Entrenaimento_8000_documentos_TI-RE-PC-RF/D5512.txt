#ITI#Chronic effects of moniliformin in broilers and turkeys fed dietary treatments to market age#FTI#
#IRE#Floor pen studies were conducted, with broilers from 1 to 7 wk of age and with turkeys from 1 to 14 wk of age, to evaluate the chronic effects of moniliformin (M). Fusarium fujikuroi (M-1214) culture material was added to typical corn-soybean basal diets to supply 0, 25, or 50 mg M/kg diet (broilers) or 0, 12.5, 25, 37.5, or 50 mg M/kg diet (turkeys). Compared with controls, chicks fed diets containing 50 mg M/kg consumed more feed, had lower body weight gain, were less efficient in converting feed to body weight gain, and had increased relative heart and proventriculus weights. Chicks fed the diet containing 50 mg M/kg also had significantly higher mortality and decreased mean corpuscular volumes compared with controls. Broilers fed 25 and 50 mg M/kg also had increased serum gamma glutamyltransferase activities. Feed intake, body weight gain, and feed conversion of turkeys fed dietary M were not affected. At 6 and 14 wk, turkeys fed 25, 37.5, or 50 mg M/kg diet had increased (P < 0.05) relative heart weights when compared with controls. At week 14, turkeys fed diets containing 37.5 or 50 mg M/kg also had increased (P < 0.05) relative liver weights compared with turkeys fed 0, 12.5, or 25 mg M/kg diet. Lesions, observed only in the hearts of broilers and turkeys fed 50 mg M/kg, were loss of cardiomyocyte cross striations, increased cardiomyocyte nuclear size, and an increased number of cardiomyocyte mitotic figures (turkeys only). Results indicate that ≥37.5 mg M/kg is hepatoxic and ≥25 mg M/ kg is cardiotoxic to turkeys and 50 mg M/kg diet is toxic to broilers fed to market age.#FRE#
