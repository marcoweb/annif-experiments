#ITI#Susceptibility of the selected crops in storage to sitophilus zeamais motschulsky in southwestern nigeria#FTI#
#IRE#Susceptibility of the selected Nigerian cultivars of twelve crops to Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky was evaluated in the laboratory (28 ± 2°C temperature and 69 ± 5% relative humidity). The crops were: maize (Zea mays L.), millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) X R. Br.], sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], rice (Oryza sativa L.), and yam (Dioscorea rotundata Poir). Others were cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp], groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), melon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)], soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and bambara groundnut [Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc]. The result of antixenosis prescreen shows that S. zeamais preferred cereals and tubers to legumes and oil crops. S. zeamais preference for maize was highest at 1, 24 and 48 hours after infestation (HAI) and was not significantly different from its preference for pepper, millet, sorghum and yam. At 48 HAI, S. zeamais preference for cereals, tubers and pepper was not significantly different. Soybean and bambara groundnut were the least preferred species. The highest level of damage was observed in cereals and tubers. Millet suffered significantly greater damage than maize at 2-8 weeks after infestation (WAI). Damage done to maize was not significantly different from damage done to tubers at 6 and 8 WAI. Pepper, legumes and oil crops suffered significantly lower levels of damage than maize throughout the experimental period. Cumulative number of adult was significantly higher in small-seeded cereals than maize and was of the order: sorghum>millet>rice. Cowpea, soybean and pepper did not support reproduction and longevity of S. zeamais. Longevity was best supported by cassava. The results show that in storage, cereals and tubers were more susceptible to S. zeamais infestation than legumes, spices and oil crops. © 2008, Versita. All rights reserved.#FRE#
