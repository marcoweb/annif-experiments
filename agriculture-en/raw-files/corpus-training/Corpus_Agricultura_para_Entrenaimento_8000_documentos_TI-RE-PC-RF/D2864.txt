#ITI#Studies on genetic variability, character association and path co-efficient analysis in greengram [Vigna Radiata.(L.)Wilczek]#FTI#
#IRE#Thirty five divergent genotypes of greengram [Vigna radiata.(L.) Wilczek] were evaluated for yield and yield attributes during rabi, 2009-10. Genotypes differed significantly for all the characters studied. High genetic advance coupled with high heritability was observed for characters viz., plant height, number of pods/plant, shoot dry matter/plant and seed yield/plant, indicating there by the preponderance of additive gene action for these characters. Correlation analysis indicated that seed yield /plant was positive and significantly associated with days to maturity, plant height, number of pods/plant, number of seeds/pod, 100-seed weight, shoot nitrogen, seed protein and shoot dry matter/plant. Path co-efficient analysis revealed that days to flowering, days to maturity, number of pods/plant, seed protein, shoot dry matter/plant and 100-seed weight had positive direct effects on seed yield/plant. Hence, selection on these traits could be improving seed yield in greengram.#FRE#
