#ITI#Germination niche breadth of invasive Iris pseudacorus (L.) suggests continued recruitment from seeds with global warming#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Understanding recruitment processes of invasive species is central to conservation and management strategies. Iris pseudacorus, an emergent macrophyte, has established invasive populations across a broad global range, and reduces biodiversity in wetland ecosystems. Climate change is altering germination cues, yet studies on the invasion of wetland macrophytes often ignore germination ecology despite its importance to their establishment and spread. Methods: We explored germination of seeds from invasive I. pseudacorus populations in California in response to seed coat presence or absence, and several environmental factors. Using experimental results in a thermal time model, we derived germination temperature thresholds. Results: Germination of I. pseudacorus seeds did not require cold or warm stratification, and was not affected by seed coat presence or absence. Germination occurred in the dark, although germinability was two- to threefold times greater under light. At constant temperature, thermal time model estimates included 18.3 ± 1.8°C base germination temperature (Formula presented.)); 28.2 ± 0.5°C optimal temperature (Formula presented.)); and 41.0 ± 1.7°C ceiling temperature (Formula presented.)). Seeds exposed to 36.0°C achieved over 10% germination, and embryos of ungerminated seeds presented 76% viability. Overall, germinability remained relatively low at constant temperatures (≤25%) but was close to 90% under alternating daily temperatures. Conclusions: Exposure to diurnally fluctuating temperatures is essential for this species to achieve high germination rates. Our study reveals that I. pseudacorus has a broad germination niche supporting its establishment in a relatively wide range of environments, including at high temperatures more frequent with climate change. © 2022 The Authors.
