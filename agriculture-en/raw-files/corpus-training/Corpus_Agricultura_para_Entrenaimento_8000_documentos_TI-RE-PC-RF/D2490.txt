#ITI#In vitro investigation of biopriming on seed quality parameters in Green Gram [vigna radiata (L.)]#FTI#
#IRE#The in vitro investigation was conducted during the kharif 2017 in the Department of Seed Science and Technology, College of Agriculture, Vijayapura. The experiment comprised of nine biopriming treatments along with control. The experiment was laid out in CRD with three replications. The seeds were subjected to in vitro studies and data was analysed statistically. The seed bioprimed with Rhizobium leguminosarum @ 20 per cent recorded higher seed germination percentage (90.50 %), shoot length (19.27 cm), root length (12.38 cm), seedling length (31.65 cm), seedling dry weight (373.0 mg), seedling vigour index I (2864), seedling vigour index II (33.75), dehydrogenase enzyme activity (1.010 OD value) and lower electrical conductivity (0.107 dS m-1) followed by Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 20 per cent, Fluorescent pseudomonad sp. @ 20 per cent as compared to control.
