#ITI#Growth and tissue nutrient responses of adults of Sarracenia alata to prey exclusion, nutrient addition, and neighbor reduction#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Carnivorous plants are often associated with nutrient-poor soils and fires. Fire can decrease available soil nitrogen (N) and increase light availability, thus potentially favoring carnivory if prey provide N. Prey can also be a source of phosphorus (P), however, and soil P-availability often increases and competition for prey can decrease following fire. Carnivory thus might be more advantageous before fire when prey and/or soil P are more limiting. Methods: We examined nutrient limitation of growth in a carnivorous plant, Sarracenia alata, in a wet pine savanna in southeastern Mississippi, USA. We measured growth and N:P tissue concentration responses of adult plants to a factorial arrangement of prey capture, neighbor reduction, and addition of N, P, and ash to the soil. We tested two hypotheses: (1) Prey provide N, and neighbor reduction and ash addition increase light and soil P and thus the benefit of carnivory; and (2) Prey provide P, neighbor reduction increases prey and/or P, and prey exclusion reduces growth the most when neighbors are not reduced. Results: The exclusion of prey reduced growth more when neighbors were not reduced, an effect that was ameliorated slightly by the addition of P to the soil (the P-limitation hypothesis). Prey exclusion caused a decrease in tissue P when N was added to the soil. Conclusions: The results of this study with adult plants differed from those of a previous study using small juvenile plants, suggesting a shift from light limitation to P and prey limitation with increasing size. © 2022 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
