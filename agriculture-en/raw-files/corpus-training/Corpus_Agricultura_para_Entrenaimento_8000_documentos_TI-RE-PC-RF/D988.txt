#ITI#Study on the photosynthetic growth characters in Cimicifuga dahurica (Turcz.) Maxim under different supplemental light environments#FTI#
#IRE#Cimicifuga dahurica (C. dahurica) is an important medicinal plant in the northern region of China. The best supplemental light environment helps plant growth, development, and metabolism. In this study, we used two-year-old seedlings as experimental materials. The white light as the control (CK). The different ratios of red (R) and blue (B) combined light were supplemented (T1, 2R: 1B, 255.37 μmol m−2·s−1; T2, 3R: 1B, 279.69 μmol m−2·s−1; T3, 7R: 1B, 211.16 μmol m−2·s−1). The growth characteristics, photosynthetic pigment content, photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and primary metabolite content were studied in seedlings. The results showed that: 1) The fresh weight from shoot, root, and total fresh weight were significantly (P < 0.05) increased under T2 and T3 treatment. 2) The contents of chlorophyll a (Chl a), chlorophyll b (Chl b), and total chlorophyll (Chl) were significantly (P < 0.05) increased under T2 treatment, and carotenoid (car) content was reduced. 3) The photochemical quenching (qP), the actual photosynthetic efficiency of PSII (Y(II)), and the photosynthetic electron transfer rate (ETR) from leaves were significantly (P < 0.05) increased under T1 treatment. The Net photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and transpiration rate (Tr) were significantly (P < 0.05) increased under T2 and T3 treatments. 4) A total of 52 primary metabolites were detected in C. dahurica leaves. Compared with CK, 14, 15, and 18 differential metabolites were screened under T1, T2, and T3 treatments. In addition, D-xylose, D-glucose, glycerol, glycolic acid, and succinic acid were significantly (P < 0.05) accumulated under the T2 treatment, which could regulate the TCA cycle metabolism pathway. The correlation analysis suggested that plant growth was promoted by regulating the change of D-mannose content in galactinol metabolism and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. In summary, the growth of C. dahurica was improved under T2 treatment. © 2024#FRE#
