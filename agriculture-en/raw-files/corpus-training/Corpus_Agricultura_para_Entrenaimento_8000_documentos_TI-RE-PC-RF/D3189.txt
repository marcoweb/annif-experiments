#ITI#Chloride salts inhibit emergence and seedling growth of chickpea rather than germination#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of chloride salts (NaCl, MgCl2 and CaCl2) with the same electrical conductivity (EC) values on germination, emergence, seedling growth and Cl content of seedling in chickpea cultivars (Akçin 91, Aziziye, Gökçe, Inci, Işık-05 and Yaşa-05) were investigated. The EC values of the chloride salts were adjusted to 4, 8 and 16 dS m-1 and the distilled water was served as control. Germination percentage, mean germination time, radicula and plumula lengths, fresh and dry radicula and plumula weight, chloride (Cl-) content of seedling in germination test, and seedling length, fresh and dry seedling weight in emergence test were measured. The results revealed that increasing salt doses caused a significant reduction in parameters of all cultivars. The dose of 16 dS m-1 from each salt was found to be lethal. Cl- content of seedling was increased from 0.05 ppm in control to 4.10 ppm in 16 dS m-1; resulting in decreasing germination, emergence and seedling growth. The cultivar Aziziye presented better performance and gave higher emergence rates in NaCl, while Işık-05 in CaCl2 and Gökçe in MgCl2; indicating that there was a genotypic variation towards different salt sources. It was concluded that emergence and seedling growth were severely influenced by increasing salinity without changing germination and emergence was not possible at 16 dS m-1. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
