#ITI#The water transfer effects on agricultural development in the lower Tarim River, Xinjiang of China#FTI#
#IRE#The ecological process in the Tarim River, Xinjiang, northwest China, has undergone great changes due to human disturbance over the past 50 years. Most notably, alteration in the spatial-temporal pattern of water resources has resulted in a damaged or degraded vegetative ecosystem in the lower reaches of Tarim River, a condition that restricts local economical development. However, after raising the water level by watering to the lower Tarim River, such ecological degradation was obviously reversed within a certain region of the water channel. Both agricultural production and animal husbandry improved greatly as well. Taking the 35th state farm as an example, the areas utilized or available for farming increased greatly; furthermore, the total value of agricultural production is 1293.13 × 104 US$, increased by 128% (the rate between the increased production and the original one) after adoption of new management of water. Livestock population has experienced a growth trend as a result of water transfer compared before water transfer. The results of this investigation suggest that the reversible state of the eco-environment following watering has had a positive effect on local agricultural development. In addition, we analyzed the relationship between ecological change and agricultural development and discuss water resource management and its ecological significance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
