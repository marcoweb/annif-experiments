#ITI#Ammonium improved cell wall and cell membrane P reutilization and external P uptake in a putrescine and ethylene dependent pathway#FTI#
#IRE#Ammonium promotes rice P uptake and reutilization better than nitrate, under P starvation conditions; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, ammonium treatment significantly increased putrescine and ethylene content in rice roots under P deficient conditions, by increasing the protein content of ornithine decarboxylase and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase compared with nitrate treatment. Ammonium treatment increased rice root cell wall P release by increasing pectin content and pectin methyl esterase (PME) activity, increased rice shoot cell membrane P release by decreasing phosphorus-containing lipid components, and maintained internal P homeostasis by increasing OsPT2/6/8 expression compared with nitrate treatment. Ammonium also improved external P uptake by regulating root morphology and increased rice grain yield by increasing the panicle number compared with nitrate treatment. The application of putrescine and ethylene synthesis precursor ACC further improved the above process. Our results demonstrate for the first time that ammonium increases rice P acquisition, reutilization, and homeostasis, and rice grain yield, in a putrescine- and ethylene-dependent manner, better than nitrate, under P starvation conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
