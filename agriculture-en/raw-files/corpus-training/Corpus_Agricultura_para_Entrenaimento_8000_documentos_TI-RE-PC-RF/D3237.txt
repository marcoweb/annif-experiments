#ITI#Reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR analysis of gene expression in mung bean under abiotic stress and cercospora canescens infection#FTI#
#IRE#The objective of the study was to identify suitable reference genes that can be used for quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis in mung bean (Vigna radiata). Therefore, 10 potential reference genes were selected and the results showed that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme was suitable as reference under drought and pathogen infection stress; elongation factor 1-α was the most stable gene under waterlogging; and actin performed the best under saline stress. These selected reference genes were further confirmed by analysis of the expression profiles of catalase and peroxidase under waterlogging. Our results will contribute to the improvement of the accuracy of gene expression evaluation in mung bean. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
