#ITI#Production and nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium absorption of sword bean leaf (Canavalia gladiata) in application of rock phosphate and VAM inoculation#FTI#
#IRE#Sword Beans (Canavalia gladiata) have high biomass, resistant to drought, pests and diseases, high fertility and seed productivity. The research purpose was to know rock phosphate dose effect on production and nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium uptake of sword bean leaf with VAM application. The design used was completely randomized design (CRD) with 2x5 factorial and repeated three times. The first factor was VAM; M0: Without VAM and M1: With VAM of 10 g/bag. The second factor was rock phosphate; P0: Without rock phosphate, P1: Rock phosphate fertilization; 100 kg / ha, P2: 200 kg / ha, P3: 300 kg / ha and P4: 400 kg / ha. The results; dry matter and calcium absorption of sword bean leaves showed similar results for VAM and without VAM application. The nitrogen uptake of VAM inoculated plants differed significantly higher than non VAM application. In phosphorus uptake there was VAM and rock phosphate interaction.
