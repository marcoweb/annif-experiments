#ITI#Growth and fecundity of colonizing hybrid Raphanus populations are environmentally dependent#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Hybrid gene pools harbor more genetic variation than progenitor populations. Thus, we expect hybrid populations to exhibit more dynamic evolutionary responses to environmental variation. We ask how environmental variation experienced by adapted and transplanted populations influence the success of late-generation hybrid populations during invasion. Methods: For four generations, 20 wild (Raphanus raphanistrum) and 20 hybrid radish (R. sativus × R. raphanistrum) plant populations evolved under experimentally manipulated moisture conditions (dry, wet, control-sheltered, or control-unsheltered plots; i.e., evolutionary environment) in old fields near Toronto, Canada. We planted advanced-generation wild and hybrid radishes in sheltered plots and exposed them to either an evolutionary or a novel watering environment. To determine how soil moisture would influence invasion success, we compared the phenotype and fecundity of plants grown in these various environments. Results: Hybridization produced larger plants. In wet environments, hybrid seedlings emerged more frequently and expressed higher photosynthetic activity. Low-moisture, novel conditions delayed and reduced seedling emergence frequency. Hybrid plants and those that evolved under relatively wet environments exhibited higher aboveground biomass. Hybrid plants from control-sheltered plots colonizing novel moisture environments were more fecund than comparable wild plants. Conclusions: Dry environments are less likely than other evolutionary environments to contribute colonists. However, relatively wet locations support the evolution of relatively fecund plants, especially crop-wild hybrid populations. Thus, our results provide a strong mechanistic explanation for variation in the relative success of crop-wild hybrids among study locations and a new standard for studies that assess the risk of crop-wild hybridization events. © 2021 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
