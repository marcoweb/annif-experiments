#ITI#Evaluation of mustard meal as organic fertiliser on tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc) Trotter) under field and greenhouse conditions#FTI#
#IRE#Experiments were conducted to evaluate the potential use of mustard meal as organic fertiliser on tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc) Trotter). Mustard meal is a high quality nutrient source with 6.35% lignin, 2.1% total extractable polyphenol, C to N ratio of 14 and lignin to N ratio of 1.1. Under field conditions the effect of tef on Nitosol was studied in a split plot design with three replications. Grain yield increases due to increased mustard meal N rate varied from 2 to 116% over the control. The agronomic efficiency was 3.0, 8.3 and 13.5 kg when N was applied at 15, 23 and 31 kg ha-1, respectively. The mustard meal N use efficiency was 7.6, 20.6 and 33.7% for the above-indicated N rates. Application of mustard meal in powder form was more effective than granular. In the greenhouse, the effect of mustard meal and urea N mixed in different quantity was studied with 15N technique. The N derived from fertiliser was lowest (3.5%) when 20 mg pot-1 from urea was combined with 100 mg pot-1 from mustard meal and highest (11%) when 67 and 33 mg pot-1 as urea and mustard meal were combined, respectively. The N derived from mustard meal was lowest (3.3%) when mustard meal and urea N were combined at 50 mg N pot -1 each, and highest (8.9%) when combined at 20 and 100 mg N pot-1, respectively. The urea and mustard meal N yields significantly varied between the treatments. The N use efficiency from urea (FNUE) varied from 38.4 to 43%. Combining urea and mustard meal N at 50 mg N pot-1 each has decreased FNUE to 4.4% compared to the urea N applied alone at 50 mg N pot-1. N use efficiency (NUE) from mustard meal was highest (38.4%) when mustard meal and urea N were combined at 33 and 67 mg N pot-1, respectively, and lowest when it was combined at 67 and 33 mg N pot-1.
