#ITI#Effects of planting distance and seed rate on the growth and yield of egusi melon (Citrullus colocynthis)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Egusi melon production is declining, even though the crop plays a significant role in the well-being of farmers. Few farmers that grow the crop do not allow adequate spacing and seed rate which compels the crop to produce flourishing vegetative parts without producing many fruits. The study was therefore, aimed at determining the effect of planting distance and seed rate on the growth and yield of egusi melon. Methods: A split-plot design which was replicated thrice was adopted to carry out the study during 2018 and 2019 planting seasons. Twenty-four plots were made and were randomly assigned to eight treatment groups with each replicating thrice. The egusi melon seeds were sown in four different seed rates of one seed/hole, two seeds/hole, three seeds/hole and four seeds/hole and four different spacing of 30cm × 50cm, 45cm × 70cm, 60cm × 60cm and 60cm × 90cm respectively. Analysis of variance was used to analyze the data collected and was tested at 0.05 level of probability. Result: The number of leaves/plant, branches/plant, flowers/plant, fruits/plant and fruit weight (g) were significantly higher in egusi melon planted at 60cm × 90cm. Furthermore, the parameters measured were significantly higher in egusi melon planted at 1 seed/hole. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
