#IRE#With this study, it is aimed to determine the effects of some abiotic factors on the exit of poppy root weevils (Ethelcus denticulatus Schrank) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) from their overwintering area. Poppy root weevils is the most important harmful pest of poppy fields (Papaver somniferum L.) (Rhoedales; Papaveraceae). According to the findings, the first adults were seen on the soil on March 10, 2014. It has been observed that as the temperature of the air increases, the number of adults on the soil surface also increases. Thus, it was determined that the number of adults in square meters reached the highest level on April 21, 2014. After this date, it was determined that the number of wintering adults decreased gradually. While the first insect on the surface of the field was caught on March 09, 2015 in the second year. It was determined that the number of highest poppy root weevils caught on the soil surface and in the traps was on April 13, 2015. After this date, it was determined that both the trapped insects and their numbers in m2 decreased. There were significant (P>0.05) correlations between the poppy root weevil exit from their overwintering area and soil temperature (r=0.648, r2=0.461, n=84 P=0.000) and temperature (r=0.59, r2=0.277, n=84, P=0.004) whereas there was no significant correlation between it and soil moisture (r=0.310, r2=0.021, n=84, P=0.466), humidity (r=0.32, r2=0.108, n=84, P=0.87) and rain (r=0.38, r2=0.101, n=84, P=0.73).
