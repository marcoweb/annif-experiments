#ITI#Effects of prior coinfection with different Salmonella serovars on the progression of a Salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis infection in hens undergoing induced molt#FTI#
#IRE#Four trials were conducted to evaluate whether prior infection with Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (S. typhimurium) or Salmonella enterica serovar muenchen (S. muenchen) would modify the severity or the transmission of Salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (S. enteritidis) challenge in hens undergoing molt via feed withdrawal. Hens were separated into two groups where one group received a prior S. typhimurium or S. muenchen infection, whereas the other group remained untreated until S. enteritidis challenge. In trials 1 and 2, one group of hens was infected with S. typhimurium 5 days prior to feed withdrawal. Both groups of hens were then challenged with S. enteritidis on day 4 post feed withdrawal. In trials 3 and 4, one group of hens received S. typhimurium or S. muenchen, respectively, 1 day after feed was withdrawn. Transmission of S. enteritidis was evaluated by challenging the center hen in rows of 11 hens per row with S. enteritidis at 4 days post feed withdrawal and following the progression of the S. enteritidis down the row of hens over time. In trials land 2, where hens received S. typhimurium 5 days prior to feed withdrawal, shedding of the S. enteritidis challenge was significantly reduced in hens on day 10 postchallenge in trial 1 and on days 3 and 10 postchallenge in trial 2 compared with the hens subjected only to the molt procedure. Significantly fewer S. enteritidis were recovered in livers and spleens at day 9 postchallenge in trial 2 from hens receiving the prior S. typhimurium infection. In trial 3, where hens received S. typhimurium 1 day after feed withdrawal, S. enteritidis transmission was significantly reduced in these hens on days 3, 10, and 24 postchallenge. In trial 4, similar in methodology to trial 3 except that, rather than S. typhimurium, hens received S. muenchen, a Salmonella organism totally lacking any antigen cross-reactive with S. enteritidis, S. enteritidis transmission was significantly reduced on days 3, 10, 17, and 24 postchallenge, suggesting that factors other than specific immunity were involved in the observed resistance to S. enteritidis infection. These results indicate that prior infection of a flock with a non-S. enteritidis paratyphoid Salmonella can reduce S. enteritidis problems that may occur during a molt.#FRE#
