#ITI#Interactions between the membranes of turkey cells and Mycoplasma meleagridis#FTI#
#IRE#We used Mycoplasma meleagridis (MM) to infect the RP-9 cells and the eggshell membranes and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy to study the interactions between the organisms and the cell surfaces. The surface of the RP-9 cells contained numerous projections. After 24 hr of infection with MM, those projections were either lost or aggregated to the side; MM-like particles could be seen on the surface of the cells, and surface fluorescence could be detected by confocal microscopy. On the surface of MM-infected shell membranes were necrotic fibrous tissues and cells detected by SEM and an intense surface fluorescence detected by confocal microscopy. These results indicate that MM infection of the cell surface can result in cellular damage.#FRE#
