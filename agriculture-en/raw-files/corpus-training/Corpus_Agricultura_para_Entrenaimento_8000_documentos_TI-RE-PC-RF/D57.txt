#ITI#Classification of various nutrient deficiencies in tomato plants through electrophysiological signal decomposition and sample space reduction#FTI#
#IRE#Plants leave testimonies of undergoing physical state by depicting distinct variations in their electrophysiological data. Adequate nutrition of plants signifies their role in the growth and a plentiful harvest. Plant signal data carries enough information to detect and analyse nutrient deficiency. Classification of nutrient deficiencies through signal decomposition and bilevel measurements has not been reported earlier. The proposed work explores tomato plants in four-time cycles (Early Morning, Morning, After Noon, Night) of macronutrients Calcium (Ca), Nitrogen (N) and micronutrients Manganese (Mn), Iron (Fe). Using the Empirical Mode Decomposition method (EMD), signals are decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) in 10-levels. Further, Intrinsic mode functions are grouped into two clusters to extract descriptive data statistics and bi-level measurements. Then a novel sample selection method is proposed to achieve a better classification rate by reducing sample space. A binary classification model is built to train and test 15 features individually using discriminant analysis and naïve-Bayes classifier variants. The reported results achieved a classification rate up to 98% after 5-fold cross-validation. Attained findings endorse novel pathways for detection and classification of nutrient deficiencies in the early stages, consequently promoting prevention and treatment approaches earliest to the appearance of symptoms, also helping to enhance plant growth. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
