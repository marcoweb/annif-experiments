#ITI#Evapotranspiration of flood-irrigated pecans#FTI#
#IRE#Pecan orchards require more irrigation water to maximize yield than any other crop grown in the Southwest US. This paper reports daily evapotranspiration (Et) measurements for 2001 and 2002 in a 5.1 ha, mature pecan orchard on the Rio Grande floodplain, 7 km south of Las Cruces, NM, USA. The 21-year-old stand had an average tree height of 12.8 m, diameter at breast height of 30 cm, and tree spacing of 9.7 m × 9.7 m. Additional pecan orchards surrounded the study orchard. When the tensiometer reached a suction of 65 kPa at the 45 cm depth, the orchard was flood-irrigated. Sparling meters were installed on the pumps and read before and after each irrigation. The total irrigation amount was 1940 mm in 2001 and 1870 mm in 2002. A walk-up tower was placed in the orchard's center to support flux sensors at 16 m height. The instrument package included a net radiation (Rn), discs for soil heat flux (G), and two sets of one-propeller eddy covariance (OPEC) sensors. OPEC systems measure sensible heat flux (H) with a sensitive, vertically oriented propeller anemometer and a fine-wire thermocouple. Latent heat flux (LE) was obtained as a residual in the surface energy balance LE = Rn - G - H. The maximum daily evapotranspiration was 8 mm/day, and the yearly cumulative evapotranspiration averaged for 2 years was 1420 mm, resulting in a yearly average irrigation application efficiency of 79%. The crop coefficient (daily measured Et/reference Penman Et) ranged from 0.2 to 1.1. Increased evaporation due to irrigation was detected only for the April 9 irrigation in 2001. The seasonal water use was 4% lower in 2001 and 12% lower in 2002 than previously reported values. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
