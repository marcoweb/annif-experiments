#ITI#H5 antibody detection by blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a monoclonal antibody#FTI#
#IRE#Many commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are unable to differentiate antibody responses to different avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes. Developing an ELISA for specifically detecting the H5 antibody is the purpose of this study. Four monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were raised using A/duck/Yunlin/04 (H5N2). They were confirmed as being specific to H5. Two of these antibodies showed hemagglutination inhibition (HI) activity using the HI test. Using immunodot blot assays, three Mabs recognized both Eurasian and American H5, whereas the other Mab recognized only the tested Eurasian H5 virus. When testing denatured H5 antigen, one of the Mabs lost its antigen binding activity using Western blotting. For detecting the H5 humoral response in serum, one monoclonal antibody was purified and labeled with horseradish peroxidase to set up a blocking ELISA. Chicken sera that blocked H5 Mab binding by >29% were considered H5 antibody positive. Inhibition percentages for sera from chickens infected with other AIV subtypes, H1 to H15, were <29%. This blocking ELISA was used for 478 field chicken serum samples. The results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of this ELISA were 98.3% (232/236) and 95.9% (232/242), respectively. This blocking ELISA could be used specifically for detecting the H5 humoral responses in chickens.#FRE#
