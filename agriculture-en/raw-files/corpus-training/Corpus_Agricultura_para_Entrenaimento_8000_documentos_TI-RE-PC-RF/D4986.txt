#ITI#Antigenic and genetic characterization of an avian poxvirus isolated from an endangered hawaiian goose (Branta sandvicensis)#FTI#
#IRE#An avian poxvirus from cutaneous lesions in a Hawaiian goose (Branta sandvicensis) was characterized in this study. The virus was isolated by inoculation onto the chorioallantoic membranes (CAMs) of developing chicken embryos. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed on histopathological examination of CAM lesions. Western blotting analysis using polyclonal antiserum against fowl poxvirus (FWPV) showed differences from FWPV, but a similar antigenic profile between Hawaiian goosepox (HGP) isolate and two previous Hawaiian poxvirus isolates were observed. Still three avian poxviruses from Hawaiian birds showed distinguishable reaction in approximately 27, 34, 35, and 81 kDa proteins when polyclonal antibodies against the Hawaiian poxvirus isolate (Alala/lanakila) were used. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of DNA of this isolate also showed differences from those of FWPV and previous avianpox isolates from Hawaiian forest birds. While nucleotide sequences of a 5.3-kb PstI-HindIII fragment of the genome of HGP isolate revealed very high homology (99% identities) with Canary poxvirus (CNPV) ORF266-274, and like CNPV, homologs of three FWPV ORFs (199, 200, and 202) including any reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) sequences are not present in the genome of HGP isolate.#FRE#
