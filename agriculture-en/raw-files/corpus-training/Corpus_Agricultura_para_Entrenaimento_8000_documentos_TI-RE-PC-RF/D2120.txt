#ITI#Phosphorus availability to soyabean from an indigenous phosphate rock sample in soils from southwest Nigeria#FTI#
#IRE#Laboratory and grecnhouse experiments were conducted on 12 soil samples in Ogun State of Nigeria to evaluate the comparative transformation of Ogun phosphate rock (OPR), single Superphosphate (SSP) and OPR: SSP mixture within soils, and to determine the response of soyabean to the direct application of these sources. The OPR sample was found to contain 0.3% P soluble in water (2.7% of total P) and 3.4% P soluble in 2% formic acid (28.5% of total). Changes in the values of the P fractions in soils were affected significantly by soil type, P source and rate of application. The percent increase in Olsen P from OPR after 12 weeks of incubation averaged 44.5, 39.6 and 36.7% in Entisols, Alfisols and Ultisols, respectively. All the soils responded to OPR, OPR: SSP and SSP application. Responses to OPR were found to be related inversely to soil pH (r = 0.82). At the application rate of 60kg P ha-1, the relative agronomic effectiveness of OPR and OPR: SSP varied from 11.6 to 92.3% (mean 61.3%) and 11.6 to 101.1% (mean 51.4%), respectively. It was concluded that direct application of OPR as P source for soyabean in soils from southwest Nigeria is feasible.#FRE#
