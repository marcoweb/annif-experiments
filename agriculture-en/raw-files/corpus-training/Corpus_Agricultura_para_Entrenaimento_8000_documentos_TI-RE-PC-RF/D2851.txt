#ITI#Knowledge and adoption level of rhizobium culture among pulse cultivators of Orissa#FTI#
#IRE#Rhizobium culture was introduced as a bio-fertiliser in the pulse production programme of Orissa during pre-eighties. A study was undertaken in Balasore district during the year 2007-08 to find out the extent of adoption and knowledge level of the farmers on Rhizobium culture. It was revealed that only 4 per cent of the respondents had adopted it, whereas 41 per cent were yet to hear of it. Television was used as the source of information by the highest numbers of farmers (34%) followed by radio (28%). Nearly half of the responding farmers did not possess the knowledge of the recommended dose.#FRE#
