#IRE#Soybean-maize rotation is a profitable cropping system and is used under rain fed conditions in north China. Since crop yields have been reported to decrease when K fertilizers are not used, we analyzed the productivity trends, soil-exchangeable and non-exchangeable K contents, and K balance in a continuous cropping experiment conducted in an area with an alfisol soil in the Liaohe River plain, China. The trial, established in early 1990 and continued till 2007, included 8 combinations of recycled manure and N, P, and K fertilizers. In the unfertilized plot, the yields of soybean and maize were 1,486 and 4,124 kg ha-1 respectively (mean yield over 18 years). The yields of both soybean and maize increased to 2,195 and 7,476 kg ha-1, respectively, in response to the application of inorganic N, P, and K fertilizers. The maximum yields of soybean (2,424 kg ha-1) and maize (7,790 kg ha -1) were obtained in the plots under treatment with N, P, and K fertilizers and recycled manure. K was one of the yield-limiting macronutrients: regular K application was required to make investments in the application of other mineral nutrients profitable. The decrease in the yields of soybean and maize owing to the absence of K application averaged 400 and 780 kg ha -1, respectively. Soybean seed and maize grain yields significantly increased with the application of recycled manure. For both these crops, the variation coefficients of grain were lower with treatments that included recycled manure than without treatment. After 18 years, the soil-exchangeable and non-exchangeable K concentrations decreased; the concentrations in the case of treatments that did not include K fertilizers were not significantly different. Treatment with N, P, and K fertilizers appreciably improved the fertility level of the soil, increased the concentration of soil-exchangeable K, and decreased the non-exchangeable K concentration. In soils under treatment with N, P, and K fertilizers and recycled manure, the soil-exchangeable and non-exchangeable K levels in the 0-20 cm-deep soil layer increased by 34% and 2%, respectively, over the initial levels. Both soil-exchangeable and non-exchangeable K concentrations were the highest with on treatment with N, P, and K fertilizers and recycled manure, followed by treatment with N, P, and K fertilizers. These concentrations were lowest in unfertilized soils; the other treatments yielded intermediate results. The results showed a total removal of K by the crops, and the amount removed exceeded the amount of K added to the soil; in treatments that did not include K fertilizers, a net negative K balance was observed, from 184 to 575 kg ha-2. The combined use of N, P, and K fertilizers and recycled manure increased the K content of the 0-20 cm-deep soil layer by 125% compared to the increase obtained with the application of N, P, and K fertilizers alone. The results clearly reveal that current mineral fertilizer applications are inadequate; instead, the annual application of recycled manure along with N, P, and K fertilizers could sustain future yields and soil productivity.
