#ITI#Histopathologic findings in chickens experimentally infected with Gallibacterium anatis by nasal instillation#FTI#
#IRE#Histologic findings in chickens experimentally infected by nasal instillation with reference strains of Gallibacterium anatis are described. No clinical signs were observed in experimentally infected birds; however, sequential histologic examinations of trachea, lung, air sacs, and liver revealed lesions in all infected chickens. Our observations suggest that the reference strains of G. anatis used in this experiment are capable of causing primary infection in chickens. Despite that the experimental birds were inoculated by intranasal route, lesions were detected in the liver, suggesting a probable bacteremia. Because several degrees of severity were established in histopathologic lesions, probable variations in virulence, among the experimental strains, also are discussed.
