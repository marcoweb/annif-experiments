#ITI#Studies on genetic variability and character association for yield and yield related traits in french bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Eighteen genotypes of french bean were evaluated for genetic variability and correlation studies for pod yield and its attributing characters. Both GCV and PCV corresponded closely for all the characters indicating low environmental influence. Highest GCV and PCV were recorded for seed weight per pod (145.12 % and 144.87%, respectively). The highest heritability estimate was observed for number of pods per plant (99.71 %). Pod yield per plant was significantly and positively correlated with number of pods per plant, flower per inflorescence, pod set per inflorescence, plant height and number of leaves per plant. Six characters viz., number of pods per plant (0.917), pod girth (0.791), plant height (0.765), flowers per inflorescence (0.529), pod length (0.284) and days to first flowering (0.134) had high and positive direct effect on pod yield. Therefore, plant height, flower per inflorescence and number of pods per plant emerged as the three most important characters influencing pod yield and selection based on these characters may improve the pod yield.
