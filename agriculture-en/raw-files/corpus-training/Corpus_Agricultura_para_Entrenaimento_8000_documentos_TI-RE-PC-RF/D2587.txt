#ITI#Effect of diverse nutrient application on symbiotic traits, yield attributes, nutrient uptake, microbial population, dehydrogenase activity and productivity of chickpea (Cicer arietinum l.) in black soils#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments conducted in black soils, having low organic carbon and available N, medium P, high K and extractable molybdenum below the critical limit (<0.2ppm), to assess the effect of fertilizers, vermicompost (VC), amritpani (AP), biofertilizers inoculation (BFSI) viz., Rhizobium + Phosphorus solublizing bacteria + Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria with molybdenum application on chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Eight treatments viz. T1-Control (Recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF), T2-RDF + Ammonium molybdate (AM) @ 1 g kg-1 seed with BFSI, T3-Spray of AP at 30 and 60 DAS + AM @ 1 g kg-1 seed with BFSI, T4-VC @ 2 t ha-1 + AM @ 1 g kg-1 seed with BFSI, T5-AP spray at 30 and 60 DAS + VC@ 2 t ha-1 + AM @ 1 g kg-1 seed with BFSI, treatments: T6, T7 and T8 consisted of 50% RDF with T3, T4 and T5 respectively, were tried in RBD. Nodulation, plant height, branches plant-1, number of pods plant-1, seed index, chlorophyll content and Uptake of NPK recorded significantly higher with T2,T6,T7 and T8 over T1 with maximum under T8 (50% RDF + T4 ) followed by with T7 . As regards the grain yield, treatments T7, T8 and T2 resulted in significant yield increase by 27.5, 28.2 and 25.6% over RDF alone (1692 kg ha-1). Actinomycetes, Fungi and DHA recorded higher in soil wherever organics (vermicompost) and bio fertilizers inoculation was done. Available NPK in soil after crop harvest was recorded better with the integrated nutrient inputs. Â© 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
