#ITI#Overexpression of tomato glutathione reductase (SlGR) in transgenic tobacco enhances salt tolerance involving the S-nitrosylation of GR#FTI#
#IRE#S-nitrosylation, a post-translational modification (PTM) dependent on nitric oxide, is essential for plant development and environmental responsiveness. However, the function of S-nitrosylation of glutathione reductase (GR) in tomato (SlGR) under NaCl stress is yet uncertain. In this study, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an exogenous NO donor, alleviated the growth inhibition of tomato under NaCl treatment, particularly at 100 μM. Following NaCl treatment, the transcripts, enzyme activity, and S-nitrosylated level of GR were increased. In vitro, the SlGR protein was able to be S-nitrosylated by S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), significantly increasing the activity of GR. SlGR overexpression transgenic tobacco plants exhibited enhanced germination rate, fresh weight, and increased root length in comparison to wild-type (WT) seedlings. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was lower, whereas the expression and activities of GR, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT); the ratio of ascorbic acid/dehydroascorbic acid (AsA/DHA), reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), total soluble sugar and proline contents; and the expression of stress-related genes were higher in SlGR overexpression transgenic plants in comparison to the WT plants following NaCl treatment. The accumulation of NO and S-nitrosylated levels of GR in transgenic plants was higher in comparison to WT plants following NaCl treatment. These results indicated that S-nitrosylation of GR played a significant role in salt tolerance by regulating the oxidative state. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
