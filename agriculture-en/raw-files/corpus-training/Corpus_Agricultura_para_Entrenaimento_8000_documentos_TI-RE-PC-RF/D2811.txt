#ITI#Production potential of Maize and Mustard under different intercropping systems in moisture deficit sub-tropical areas of Jammu and Kashmir, India#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were conducted at Dryland Research Sub-station, Rakh Dhainsar, Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Jammu to study the effect of mustard and on the productivity of maize intercropping system in moisture deficit sub-tropical areas of Jammu and Kashmir. Initially the experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with four mustard based intercropping systems as experimental treatments during rabi of 2008-09 and by keeping the rabi imposed intercropping systems as main plot treatments, four new maize based intercropping systems as sub-plot treatments with four replications. The maize from intercropping system of maize+ cowpea preceded by mustard+ fieldpea registered statistical higher grain and stover yield as that recorded under sole maize preceded by mustard based intercropping systems and it was also produced more number of gains/cob and 1000-grain weight than other intercropping systems preceded by mustard based intercropping systems. Higher nutrient removal by maize was also recorded in maize+ cowpea preceded by mustard+ fieldpea system.#FRE#
