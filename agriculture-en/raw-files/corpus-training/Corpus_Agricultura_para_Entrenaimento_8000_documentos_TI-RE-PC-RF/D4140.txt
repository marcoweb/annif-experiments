#ITI#Adenoviral gizzard erosion in broiler chickens in Germany#FTI#
#IRE#Avian adenovirus infections cause important disease complexes in chickens, but many of the viruses also infect chickens without resulting in overt disease. Previously several outbreaks of gizzard erosions caused by a fowl adenovirus A serotype-1 (FAdV-1) were reported from Japan. Here we report an outbreak of gizzard erosions in 12 broiler flocks in Germany in 2011. Chickens had a reduced daily weight gain and a higher total mortality rate of up to 8%. The birds showed a severe detachment of the koilin layer and ulcerative to necrotizing lesions of the underlying mucosa. Histopathologically, necrotizing ventriculitis with basophilic, intranuclear inclusion bodies in epithelial cells was diagnosed. Immunohistochemistry, egg culture, and electron microscopic examination revealed adenovirus-like particles in the samples. No concurrent infectious agent could be identified. The virus was genotyped as FAdV-1 by PCR and subsequent sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the hexon loop L1 gene yielded 100% sequence identity to the chicken embryo lethal orphan strain. These findings suggest that outbreaks of adenoviral gizzard erosion can lead to significant economic losses in Germany and may be caused by an unusual virulent FAdV-1 strain.
