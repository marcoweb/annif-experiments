#ITI#Efficacy of flumioxazine 50% SC for weed control in soybean#FTI#
#IRE#The experimental research was conducted to study efficacy of flumioxazine 50% SC at various dosage for weed control in soybean over Pendimethalin 30% EC, Oxyflourfen 23.5 % EC and Chlorimuron Ethyl 25% WP. Weed control efficiency, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, 100 seed weight, grain yield, haulm yield, harvest index, net return and BC ratio were evaluated. The results revealed that pre-emergence application of flumioxazine at 250 g/ha recorded higher weed control efficiency at all stages of crop growth followed by pre-emergence application of flumioxazine at 150 g/ ha. Pre-emergence application of flumioxazine at 112.5 g/ ha recorded increased yield and economic returns in soybean. Pre-emergence application of flumioxazine at 112.5 g/ ha can reduce the weed growth below the economic threshold level and increase the yield and net return and hence it provides an option to farmers to manage weeds effectively along with improved growth leading to higher productivity of soybean. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
