#ITI#Character association and assessment of yield loss in pigeonpea cultivars infested by pod fly and bruchid#FTI#
#IRE#Field studies were conducted at IIPR, Kanpur, India to estimate the intensity of field infestation on pigeonpea by pod fly and bruchids, and whether or not the phenotypic characters of the pigeonpea related to infestation caused by these insects. A total 32 long duration pigeonpea cultivars and advanced breeding lines were planted in augmented design along with check ‘Bahar’ and evaluated on the basis of exit holes and windows per pod, seed damage (%) by pod fly maggot and bruchid grub, 100 damaged seeds weight and relative resistant rating. Breeding line IPA-92 and a cultivar MA-3 were found to be highly resistant against pod fly, preventing them from crafting exit holes on pods and seed damage (%). Bruchid (C. chinensis and C. maculatus) was vulnerable to make windows on pods damaging the seeds of cultivars viz., IPA-15-1, IPA-15-5, IPA-15-7, IPA-15-10, IPA-15-12, IPA-15-14, MA-3, IPA-92, AZAD, IPA-234, BSMR-736, IPA-13-1 and IPA-37. Correlation studies revealed that pod fly infestation was the major biotic factor, which causes significant seeds damage and yield reduction in pigeonpea cultivars and advanced breeding lines. Those cultivars and breeding lines exhibited resistant reaction on pod fly and bruchids infestation might be used as donors in resistance breeding programme and including in IPM modules against these insect pests. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
