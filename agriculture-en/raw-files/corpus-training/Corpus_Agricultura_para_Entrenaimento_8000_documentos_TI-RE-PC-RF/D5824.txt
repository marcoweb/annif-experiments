#ITI#Disentangling phylogenetic and functional components of shape variation among shoot apical meristems of a wide range of herbaceous angiosperms#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: The shoot apical meristem (SAM) is the basic determinant of plant body organization, but interspecific variation in SAM shape and its relationship to stem and leaf morphological traits is not well known. Here we tested the hypothesis that different SAM shapes are associated with specific shoot traits of the plant body and examined the phylogenetic conservatism of these relationships. Methods: We used geometric morphometrics of SAM outlines for a phylogenetically representative set of 110 herbaceous angiosperms and examined their relationship to a number of shoot traits. Results: We found large variations in SAM shapes across angiosperm lineages, but covering only a subset of geometrically possible shapes. Part of this variation was allometric (due to SAM size), but the dominant shape variation (dome-shaped vs. flat surface) was size-independent and strongly phylogenetically conserved. SAM shapes were largely independent of their cell size and therefore of the number of cells involved. Different patterns in shape variation of outer and inner SAM boundaries were associated with stem thickness, leaf area, and leafiness of the stem. Conclusions: The findings show that geometric interdependence of meristem zones gives rise to correlations among organ numbers, sizes, and their proportions. Phylogenetic conservatism in these correlations indicates conservatism in regulatory processes that underlie the correlations, or the individual traits, that give rise to plant architecture. © 2019 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
