#ITI#High quantitative trait variability in faba bean mutagenized population for high-yielding breeding program in saudi arabia#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The narrow genetic base and environmental stresses are behind the low rate of faba bean yield in the past two decades. Drought stress is one of the most destructive abiotic stresses. Using induced mutagenesis on locally adapted landrace cultivar is proposed to cope with this problem. Methods: This study was conducted on faba bean landrace cultivar of Saudi Arabia, namely Hassawi 2, treated by 25 and 50 Gray gamma radiation. The genetic diversity assessment of M2 mutant populations was based on seven quantitative traits and nine Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) primer combinations. Result: A total of 3419 M2 seeds were planted, of which 2782 (81.4%) seeds germinated and 2658 plants survived. A 5 to a 10-fold range of quantitative traits studied among mutant plants compared to control plants showed high variability. The number of pods per plant and seeds per plant was a valid selection criterion for a high-yielding faba bean breeding program. Nine AFLP primer combinations generated 1079 polymorphic alleles from 88 samples that comprised mutant and control plants. Shannon index (I) and expected heterozygosity (He) were 0.337 and 0.206, respectively. The AFLP results validated high variability in M2 populations. These findings will assist faba bean breeders in developing high-yielding cultivars with drought stress tolerance. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
