#ITI#In vitro antifungal activity of three Saudi plant extracts against some phytopathogenic fungi#FTI#
#IRE#The antifungal activities of ethanolic extracts of three Saudi plants; camel thorn (Alhagi maurorum Medic.), caper (Capparis spinosa L.), and pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) were investigated in vitro against Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, Phoma destructiva, Rhizoctonia solani, and Sclerotium rolfsii at concentrations of 0, 3, 6, and 9% (v/v). All tested plant extracts; seeds, roots, and rinds had different degrees of antifungal activity against the tested fungi. When compared with the control, the highest antifungal activity was recorded for camel thorn seeds extract at a concentration of 9%, while, pomegranate rinds extract at 9% came in second. Camel thorn rinds extract came in last even when used at a high concentration. The ethanolic extract of camel thorn seeds may be recommended as a potent bio-fungicide. Extensive studies should be undertaken for the ethanolic extract of camel thorn seeds as a strong antifungal agent against fungal plant diseases.#FRE#
