#ITI#Tissue tropism and bursal transformation ability of subgroup J avian leukosis virus in white leghorn chickens#FTI#
#IRE#In Experiment 1, a monoclonal antibody against the envelope glycoprotein (gp85) of subgroup J avian leukosis virus (ALV-J) was used to study the distribution of ALV-J in various tissues of White Leghorn chickens inoculated as embryos with the strain ADOL-Hc1 of ALV-J. At 2 and 6 wk of age, various tissues from infected and control uninfected chickens were tested for the presence of ALV-J gp85 by immunohistochemistry. In Experiment 2, using the methyl green-pyronine (MGP) stain, sections of bursa of Fabricius (BF) from chickens of line 15I5 Ã— 71, inoculated with ALV-J or Rous-associated virus-1 (RAV-1), a subgroup A ALV, at hatch were examined for transformation of bursal follicles at 4 and 10 wk of age. In Experiment 1, specific staining indicative of the presence of ALV-J gp85 was noted at both 2 and 6 wk of age in the adrenal gland, bursa, gonads, heart, kidney, liver, bone marrow, nerve, pancreas, proventriculus, spleen, and thymus. In Experiment 2, by 10 wk of age, transformed bursal follicles were detected in MGP-stained sections of BF in only one of five (20%) chickens inoculated with ALV-J at hatch, compared with five of five (100%) chickens inoculated with RAV-1. The data demonstrate distribution of ALV-J gp85 in various tissues of White Leghorn chickens experimentally inoculated as embryos with the virus. The data also confirm our previous observation that ALV-J is capable of inducing transformation of bursal follicles, albeit the incidence is less frequent than that induced by subgroup A ALV.#FRE#
