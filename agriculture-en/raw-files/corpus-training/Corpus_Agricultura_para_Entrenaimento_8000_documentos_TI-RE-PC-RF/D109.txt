#ITI#Identification of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS)-coding genes involved in flowering induction of Lilium× formolongi#FTI#
#IRE#Lilium × formolongi, a facultative long-day (LD) plant, can complete the floral transition within one year after sowing under LD conditions. In addition to the photoperiod, the molecular mechanisms by which other flowering regulators, such as sugar, participate in juvenile development and flowering induction in L. × formolongi remain elusive. Therefore, based on the investigation of seedling development under different day length conditions, we explored the growth and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) contents of leaves and underground bulbs. Furthermore, the expression profiles of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS)-coding genes, LfTPSs, and miR156 were also determined. Three putative LfTPS genes, LfTPS1, LfTPS3 and LfTPS5, displayed high expression levels at the juvenile vegetative stage under different day length conditions. Among them, LfTPS1 maintained gradually elevated expression until the visible bud stage under short-day (SD) conditions. Additionally, the expression levels of LfTPS3 and LfTPS5 increased with the exogenous sucrose concentration. In contrast, the expression of miR156 rapidly decreased under the same sucrose treatments. Overexpression of LfTPS1/3/5 hastened flowering and the decline in miR156 expression levels to varying degrees in transgenic Arabidopsis. Taken together, the results demonstrate that LfTPS1, LfTPS3 and LfTPS5 modulate both juvenile vegetative development and flowering induction controlled by sugars in L. × formolongi. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
