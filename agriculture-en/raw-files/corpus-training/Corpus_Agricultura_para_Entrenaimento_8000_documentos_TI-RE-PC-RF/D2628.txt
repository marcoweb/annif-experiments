#ITI#Genetic Enhancement and Genetic Analysis of Resistance to Asian Soybean Rust in India#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Asian soybean rust caused by Phakopsorapachyrhizi Syd. is a major threat for production and expansion of soybean in India. Understanding the nature of inheritance of rust resistance in DSb 21 will help in estimating the number of genes involved in governing the resistance mechanism and thus will be helpful in designing a suitable breeding method. Methods: Utilizing JS 335 and EC 241778, in a long term breeding programme, a highly rust resistant variety, DSb 21 has been released from University of Agricultural Sciences Dharwad, Karnataka. To study the genetics of rust resistance in DSb 21, F2 and F3 generation of two crosses involving susceptible ☓ resistant (JS 335 ☓ EC 241778) and resistant ☓ susceptible (DSb 21 ☓ JS 335) were used. Result: The F2 segregation analysis in both the crosses revealed the same segregation ratio of three resistant to one susceptible phenotype based on chi square test indicating rust resistance is controlled by a single dominant gene. In both the crosses the F2 results were confirmed by studying the F3 progenies for reaction to rust. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
