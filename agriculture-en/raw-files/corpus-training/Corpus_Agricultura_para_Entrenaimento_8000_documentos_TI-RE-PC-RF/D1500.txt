#ITI#Influence of cultivars and nitrogen rates on the residual effects of potassium applications to preceding cotton on maize#FTI#
#IRE#The long-term residual effects of K application rates and cultivars for preceding cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) on subsequent maize (Zea mays L.) and the influence of N rates applied to preceding cotton and to maize on the residual K effects were examined on maize under no-tillage in the United States. Two field experiments were conducted on a no-till Loring silt loam at Jackson, TN during 1995–2008 with N rates (90 and 179 kg ha−1) × K rates (28, 56, and 84kg ha−1) and cotton cultivars (determinate and indeterminate)×K rates (56 and 112 kgha−1) as the treatments, respectively, in the preceding cotton seasons. Maize was planted under no-tillage on the preceding cotton experiments without any K application during 2009 through 2011. The residual effects of K rates applied to preceding cotton on soil K levels were significantly influenced by the N rates applied to preceding cotton and to maize when the data were combined from 2008 to 2011. Relative to the standard N management practices of 168kg Nha−1 for maize and 90 kg N ha−1 for preceding cotton, the higher N application rate 269kg Nha−1 to maize and 179kg Nha−1 to preceding cotton reduced the residual effects of K rates on soil K. However, cultivar for preceding cotton did not affect the residual effects of K fertilizer on soil K fertility, leaf K nutrition, plant growth, or grain yield of subsequent maize on a high K field. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
