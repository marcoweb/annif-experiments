#ITI#Studies on integrated agro-techniques approaches for yield maximization of pigeonpea [Cajanus Cajan (L.) millsp.] in Mid-Hills of Tripura, India#FTI#
#IRE#Pigeonpea is cultivated as a major source of protein for poor farmers with reduced yields. The low yield of pigeonpea is due to faulty agro techniques. The present investigation was conducted to see the effect of integrated agro-techniques on growth and growth attributes of pigeonpea and designed with block randomization having eight treatments viz., integrated nutrient management (INM), integrated weed management (IWM), integrated pest management (IPM) and its combos at AICRP experimental farm, College of Agriculture Tripura. Growth and yield attributes differed significantly due to integrated agro-techniques with poor weed population in IWM. The net come was highest in INM+IWM+IPM (Rs. 49243.85 and Rs. 47757.63). Results revealed that INM+IWM+IPM yielded higher followed by INM+IWM however each of them was statistically at par throughout the study. Economics led INM+IWM as best treatment than the combination of 3 agro-techniques, where additional price occurred. Â© 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
