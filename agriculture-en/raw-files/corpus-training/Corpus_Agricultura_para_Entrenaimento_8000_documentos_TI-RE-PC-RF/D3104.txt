#ITI#Role of potassium solublizing bacteria on nutrients uptake in red bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv. Goli) under water deficit condition#FTI#
#IRE#This experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of halt irrigation and bio fertilizer on plant yield, seed nutrients content, relative water content (RWC) and chlorophyll index (SPAD) of Goli genotype of red bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), based on split plot design with three replications during two years of 2014-2015 at Arak, Iran. Halt irrigation was in main plots by four levels of control (full irrigation), halt irrigation in vegetative stage, at flowering stage and pod filling stage and four bio fertilizer were in sub plots, including: control (no bacteria), Phosphorus Solublizing bacteria (PSB), potassium solublizing bacteria (KSB) and concurrent use both of PSB and KSB. Analysis of variance showed that no significant effect of years but the effect of halt irrigation treatments was significant on plant yield, N, P, K and Zn percentage of seed, relative water content (RWC) and chlorophyll index (SPAD). Halt irrigation reduced plant yield by 67.81% in comparison to full irrigation during flowering stage. In the study, physiological characteristics such as RWC, N, P, K and Zn contents were also reduced significantly with halt irrigation at flowering stage than its effects on other stages of the crop. Also other characteristics was significantly reduced in this study with halt irrigation that this reduction in flowering stage was more than other stages. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
