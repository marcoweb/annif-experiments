#ITI#Resistance of canola cultivars affect life table parameters of Nysius cymoides (Spinola) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae)#FTI#
#IRE#A life table can be used as an important and appropriate tool to evaluate the susceptibility or resistance level of different host plant cultivars to insect pests. In the current study, we determined the suitability or inferiority of five different canola cultivars (Hayula420, Hayula401, Hayula50, Hayula60, RGS) to Nysius cymoides, under laboratory conditions. Data were analysed based on the age-stage, two-sex life table theory. Nysius cymoides which fed on Hayula420 had the longest nymphal period, while those which fed on Hayula50 had the shortest nymphal period. Developmental times (sum of incubation and nymphal periods) was longest for those which fe d on Hayula420 and the shortest for those which fed on Hayula50. The adult pre-oviposition period (APOP), total pre-oviposition period (TPOP), mean fecundity, and adult longevity of adults reared on different canola cultivars showed significant differences. The highest and lowest net reproductive rates (R0) were obtained for those which fed on Hayula420 (11.40 offspring per individual) and Hayula401 (5.47 offspring per individual), respectively. The highest value (0.0395 d-1) for the intrinsic rate of increase (r) was obtained for those which fed on Hayula 60 cultivar and the lowest value (0.0261 d-1) for those which fed on Hayula401 cultivar. The shortest and longest mean generation times (T) were obtained for those which fed on RGS and H401 cultivars, respectively. The lowest and highest values of life expectancy (exj) were obtained for those which fed on RGS and Hayula420 cultivars, respectively. The results showed that Hayula401 and RGS were not susceptible cultivars to N. cymoides. These cultivars showed higher resistance to N. cymoides, while Hayula60, Hayula420, and Hayula50 were found to be suitable cultivars but with lower resistance to N. cymoides, respectively.
