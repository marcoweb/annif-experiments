#ITI#Genetic variability and association analysis for various agro morphological traits in lentil (Lens culinaris m.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Lentil is an oldest domesticated grain legume in the world. It is cultivated during winter season in India which is a major source of protein (28%) for human consumption. The present study was undertaken to study association analysis of grain yield with other quantitative traits and to estimate direct and indirect effects of various traits on grain yield. Methods: The experiment was carried out using 53 advance breeding lines of lentil in a Randomized Complete Block Design and replicated thrice. Result: The investigation revealed that days to 50% flowering, days to 75% maturity, plant height, pods/plant, biological yield/plant and grain yield/plant have significant differences and wide range of variations during both the year. Pods/plant exhibited high genotypic coefficient of variation, heritability and genetic advance signifying the effects of additive gene effect. Pods/plant and biological yield/ plant showed positive and significant correlations with grain yield /plant and also have positive direct effects on grain yield. Therefore, this investigation suggested that pods/plant and biological yield/plant may be focused during selection for genetic gain in lentil. Â© 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
