#ITI#Influence of priming with exogenous boron on the seed vigour of alfalfa (Medicago sativa l.)#FTI#
#IRE#Alfalfa seeds were primed with 0, 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.6%, 1.2%, 2.4% and 4.8% (W/V) concentration of borax solution for 0 (control), 3, 6, 9 and 12 h at 20°C. The results showed that the vigour of alfalfa seeds were very significantly (P < 0.01) related to boron concentration, priming time and their interaction, they were enhanced by the opportune concentration of boron priming, but were restrained by high concentration of boron. Priming with 0.1% boron for 6 h was the best treatment for using to improve the seed vigour of alfalfa. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
