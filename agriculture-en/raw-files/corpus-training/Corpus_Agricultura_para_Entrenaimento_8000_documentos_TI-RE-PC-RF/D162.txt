#ITI#Molecular and biochemical modifications of suspension-cultured tobacco cell walls after exposure to alternative gravity#FTI#
#IRE#The plant cell wall is a flexible physical barrier surrounding the cell which functions in growth and differentiation, signaling, and response to environmental stimuli including the Earth gravity force. In the present study, structural and molecular modifications of cell wall components of cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Burley 21) cells under alternative gravity conditions induced by 7 days exposure to 2-D clinostat have been investigated. In comparison with the control group, clinorotation significantly increased biomass but reduced the total amounts of wall and the contents of cellulose, pectin, uronic acidic, and xyloglucan. Gene expression of H+-ATPase was not changed but of expansin A reduced in clinostat-treated cells. However, the gene expression and activity of xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases (XTH; EC 2.4.1.207) and endo-(1,4)-β-D-glucanase (EGase; EC 3.2.1.4), the amount of arabinogalactan proteins (AGP), and the expression of wall-associated kinase (WAK) gene significantly increased by clinorotation. Altered gravity also reduced the activity of polyphenol oxidase and covalently bound peroxidase. The results suggest that altered gravity promoted orchestrated changes of wall-modifying genes and proteins which reduced its stiffness and enhanced cell expansion and division potential. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
