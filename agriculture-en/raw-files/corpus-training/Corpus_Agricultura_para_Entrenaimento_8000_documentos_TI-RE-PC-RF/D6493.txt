#ITI#Fruit wings accelerate germination in Anacyclus clavatus#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: The lateral membranous expansions of fruits, commonly referred to as wings, have long been theorized to serve only dispersal functions. Alternatively, because winged fruits typically have earlier seed germination than unwinged fruits, we hypothesized that wings could increase the contact surface with water, ultimately triggering earlier germination. Methods: We investigated this alternative hypothesis by exploring the potential role of fruit wings on germination in the heterocarpic species Anacyclus clavatus (Desf.) Pers. (Asteraceae), which produces both winged and unwinged fruits. First, we measured the speed and degree of water absorption in winged and unwinged fruits. Second, we investigated the effects of wings on germination performance, by either reducing wing size or by preventing water absorption by sealing wings with wax. Next, we tested the influence of water availability on the germination performance of winged and unwinged fruits by reducing the water potential. Results: Winged fruits absorbed more water at a faster rate than unwinged fruits. The sealing of wings delayed germination, whereas germination time was not significantly altered by wing cutting. The restriction of water availability by decreasing water potential significantly delayed seed germination of unwinged fruits, whereas winged fruits remained unaffected. Conclusions: Altogether, our results support the effect of wings on germination and cast doubt on the unique role of wings in dispersal. Whether or not wings contribute to dispersal, we propose that they also improve seed germination and seedling establishment by facilitating water absorption after the release from their mother plants. © 2024 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
