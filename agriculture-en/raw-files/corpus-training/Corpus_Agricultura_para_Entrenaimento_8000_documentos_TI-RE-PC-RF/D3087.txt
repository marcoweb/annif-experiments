#ITI#Effects of the Soil Moisture Content on the Superoxide Anion and Proline Contents in Soybean Leaves#FTI#
#IRE#Background: As an important source of feed protein, soybean is involved in the processing industry, food industry and other fields. Therefore, in recent years, the demand for soybean has increased and soybean pl anting areas have also increased. However, frequent droughts have a serious impact on soybean yield. Methods: During the flowering period, the soybean plants were subjected to drought treatments of different degrees (0-7 days without water). The superoxide anion and proline contents in the leaves were determined. Then, fitting curves were drawn between the soil moisture content and the superoxide anion and proline contents. Result: The effects of different soil moisture contents on the superoxide anion and proline contents in soybean leaves and the correlation between these contents were analyzed. According to the fitting curves, with a decrease in the volumetric water content of soil, the superoxide anion and proline contents in soybean leaves increased. The superoxide anion contents in drought-tolerant cultivars were significantly lower than those in drought-sensitive cultivars and the proline contents were significantly higher in drought-tolerant cultivars than those in drought-sensitive cultivars. The superoxide anion content in soybean leaves was positively correlated with the proline content in the soil volumetric water content range of 31.5% to 14.5%.
