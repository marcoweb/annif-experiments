#ITI#Induction of stomatal opening following a night-chilling event alleviates physiological damage in mango trees#FTI#
#IRE#Chilling events have become more frequent with climate change and are a significant abiotic factor causing physiological damage to plants and, consequently, reducing crop yield. Like other tropical and subtropical plants, mango (Mangifera indica L.) is particularly sensitive to chilling events, especially if they are followed by bright sunny days. It was previously shown that in mango leaves stomatal opening is restricted in the morning following a night-chilling event. This impairment results in restraint of carbon assimilation and subsequently, photoinhibition and reactive oxygen species production, which leads to chlorosis and in severe cases, cell death. Our detailed physiological analysis showed that foliar application of the guard cell H+-ATPase activator, fusicoccin, in the morning after a cold night, mitigates the physiological damage from ‘cold night–bright day’ abiotic stress. This application restored stomatal opening, thereby enabling gas exchange, releasing the photosynthetic machinery from harmful excess photon energy, and improving the plant's overall physiological state. The mechanisms by which plants react to this abiotic stress are examined in this work. The foliar application of compounds that cause stomatal opening as a potential method of minimizing physiological damage due to night chilling is discussed. © 2023#FRE#
