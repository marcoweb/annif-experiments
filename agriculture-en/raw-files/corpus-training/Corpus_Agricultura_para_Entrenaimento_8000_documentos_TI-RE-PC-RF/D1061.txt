#ITI#Multilayer regulatory landscape and new regulators identification for bud dormancy release and bud break in Populus#FTI#
#IRE#For trees originating from boreal and temperate regions, the dormancy-to-active transition, also known as bud dormancy release and bud break, are crucial processes that allow trees to reactive growth in the spring. The molecular mechanisms underlying these two processes remain poorly understood. Here, through integrative multiomics analysis of the transcriptome, DNA methylome, and proteome, we gained insights into the reprogrammed cellular processes associated with bud dormancy release and bud break. Our findings revealed multilayer regulatory landscapes governing bud dormancy release and bud break regulation, providing a valuable reference framework for future functional studies. Based on the multiomics analysis, we have determined a novel long intergenic noncoding RNA named Phenology Responsive Intergenic lncRNA 1 (PRIR1) plays a role in the activation of bud break. that the molecular mechanism of PRIR1 has been preliminary explored, and it may partially promote bud break by activating its neighbouring gene, EXORDIUM LIKE 5 (PtEXL5), which has also been genetically confirmed as an activator for bud break. This study has revealed a lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism for the control of bud break in Populus, operating independently of known regulatory pathways. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
