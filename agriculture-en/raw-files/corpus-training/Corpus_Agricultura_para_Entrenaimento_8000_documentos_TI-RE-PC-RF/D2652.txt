#ITI#Insect pests of black gram (Vigna mungo l.) and their management in vindhya region#FTI#
#IRE#A study was conducted during the Kharif season of 2016-17 divulged the beginning of white fly infestation was recorded in the 5th week of July and reached a peak level 10.93 N and A /plant in the 4th week of August and aphid infestation was recorded in the 2nd week of August and reached a peak level 12.40 N and A /plant in the 2nd week of September. Correlation coefficient values for white fly and aphid population incidence and weather parameters showed that maximum and minimum temperature had positive influence while maximum and minimum relative humidity besides rainfall had negative influence on both the pest population. The incidence of ten species of insect pests and six species of natural enemies on the crop from germination to harvesting stages. Out of these insect pests six sap feeder; two defoliator; one stem feeder and one flower feeder were observed to infest in the urdbean. Therewith, six species of natural enemies were observed in the black gram variety T-9 under the agro-climatic condition of district Rewa. Evaluate the efficacy of Flubendiamide 24% + Thiacloprid 24% SC 200 ml/ha, Flubendiamide 39.35% SC 125 ml/ha, Thiacloprid 21.7% SC 250 ml/ha, Chlorantraniliprole18.5% SC 160 ml/ha, Flubendiamide 24% + Thiacloprid 24% SC 250 ml/ha, Quinalphos 25% EC 1500 ml/ha, Thiomethoxam 25% WG 125 g/ha and Emamectin benzoate 5% SG 220 g/ha against the Bemisia tabaci and Aphis craccivora. Thiacloprid 21.7% SC was found significantly most effective against white fly while, Thiomethoxam 25% WG was found significantly most effective against aphid.
