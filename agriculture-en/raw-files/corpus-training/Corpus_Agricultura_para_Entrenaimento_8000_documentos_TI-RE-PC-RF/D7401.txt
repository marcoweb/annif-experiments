#ITI#Optimal levels of postharvest deficit irrigation for promoting early flowering and harvest dates in loquat (Eriobotrya japonica Lindl.)#FTI#
#IRE#Deficit irrigation after harvest has been proven to be a more profitable strategy for producing loquats due to its effects on promoting earlier flowering and harvest date next season. To determine water savings which most advance flowering and harvest dates, an experiment was established to compare phenology, fruit quality and yield in 'Algerie' loquats over two consecutive seasons. In this experiment some trees were programmed to receive 50%, 25% or 0% of the water applied to controls (RDI50%, RDI25%, and RDI0%, respectively) from mid-June to the end of July (6 weeks). Fully irrigated trees acted as first controls while trees undergoing previously tested postharvest deficit irrigation (25% of water applied to controls; RDILong) from early June up to the end of August (13 weeks of RDI total) acted as second controls. All deficit irrigation treatments promoted earlier flowering when compared to fully irrigated trees; the greatest advancement in full bloom date (27 days) was achieved with severe short term RDI (RDI0% and RDI25%). The trees suffering an extended period of water stress advanced full bloom date but to a lesser extent (13 and 18 days; 2004/2005 and 2005/2006, respectively). Earlier bloom derived in an earlier harvest date without detrimental effects on fruit quality and productivity. In this regard, the most severe RDI (RDI0%) advanced mean harvest date the most (7 and 9 days, depending on the season), and increased the percentage of precocious yield to the highest extent. Productivity was not diminished by reduced irrigation in either season. Fruit size and grading was enhanced thanks to RDI in both seasons. Earliness and better fruit class distribution under RDI also improved fruit value and gross revenue enabling farmers both to increase earning and economize on water. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
