#ITI#Coccidiosis control with toltrazuril in conjunction with anticoccidial medicated or nonmedicated feed#FTI#
#IRE#A 42-day broiler floor pen study was conducted comparing the anticoccidial efficacy of toltrazuril (Baycox) as a stand alone treatment and as an additional treatment to in-feed anticoccidial programs. Toltrazuril was administered on days 18 and 19 in the drinking water at 7 mg/kg of body weight. The treatments were 125 ppm nicarbazin (days 0-14) to 66 ppm salinomycin (SAL) (days 15-35) with and without toltrazuril, SAL (days 0-35) with and without toltrazuril, nonmedicated (NM) to SAL with toltrazuril, and NM with and without toltrazuril. The controls were NM noninfected and infected. The treatments were replicated in five blocks of eight pens each in a randomized complete block design. All withdrawal feed was nonmedicated. On day 14, birds, except noninfected, were exposed to coccidial oocysts (Eimeria acervulina, Eimeria maxima, and Eimeria tenella) seeded litter. On days 21, 28, 35, and 42, birds and feed were weighed, four birds per pen were coccidial lesion scored, and litter oocyst counts were performed. The coccidial infection in the NM infected treatment caused a significant (P < 0.05) coccidiosis infection. Coccidiosis was moderately controlled in the anticoccidial treatment birds without toltrazuril. Performance in the NM with toltrazuril was equal to or better (P < 0.05) than the anticoccidial programs without toltrazuril. Toltrazuril was equal to the noninfected birds in performance. Toltrazuril most completely eliminated all coccidial lesions and dramatically reduced oocyst shedding. The performance data, lesion scores, and oocyst counts showed that a 2-day treatment with toltrazuril successfully controlled the coccidiosis with no relapse of infection. Toltrazuril can thus be used for supplemental control with in-feed anticoccidials or as a primary anticoccidial with nonmedicated feed.#FRE#
