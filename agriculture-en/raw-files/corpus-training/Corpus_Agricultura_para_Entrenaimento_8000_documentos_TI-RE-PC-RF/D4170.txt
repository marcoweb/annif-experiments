#ITI#Viral kinetics, shedding profile, and transmission of serotype 1 Marek's disease vaccine Rispens/CVI988 in maternal antibody-free chickens#FTI#
#IRE#Probably the most effective current vaccine against Marek's disease is the live Rispens (CVI988) attenuated serotype 1 Marek's disease virus (MDV). It is unknown whether the currently available Rispens vaccines transmit effectively between chickens. To investigate the kinetics and shedding of three commercially available strains of this virus and the extent of lateral transmission, we measured the shedding rate in dander and the viral load in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and feather tips over time. Four identical climate-controlled rooms were stocked with a total of 70 specific-pathogen-free chickens for 56 days. In each of three rooms, 10 chickens were vaccinated with one of the commercial vaccines at day old and left in contact with 10 unvaccinated chickens. The fourth room contained 10 unvaccinated control chickens. As determined by MDV-specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction of weekly room dust and individual PBLs and feather tip samples, the vaccine virus was shed from the vaccinated chickens in dander from day 7 postvaccination and transmitted effectively from vaccinated to in-contact chickens with a lag period of 2-3 wk. Viral load in PBLs and feather tips peaked at days 7 and 14, respectively, and declined thereafter, whereas viral load in dust increased rapidly to day 21 and then increased gradually thereafter. Antibody titer at day 56 was correlated with earlier measures of MDV load in PBLs but not feather tips or dust. These results show that currently available Rispens CVI988 vaccine virus is shed in significant quantities from vaccinated chickens and transmits effectively between chickens.
