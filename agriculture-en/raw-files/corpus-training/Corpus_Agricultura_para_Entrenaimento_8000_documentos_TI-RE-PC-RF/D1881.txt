#ITI#Effect of phosphate rock and triple superphosphate on soil phosphorus fractions and their plant-availability and downward movement in two volcanic ash soils under Pinus radiata plantations in New Zealand#FTI#
#IRE#Changes in phosphorus (P) fractions and their plant-availability and downward movement in two strongly P fixing acidic Andosols (Allophanic and Pumice Soils) under Pinus radiata plantations in New Zealand were studied 2 years after triple superphosphate (TSP) and a phosphate rock (BGPR, origin Ben Guerir, Morocco) application, each at four rates, to determine the fate and plant availability of fertilizer-derived P in these soils. The rate of increase of the concentrations of the P fractions was highest for NaOH-Pi (inorganic P associated with Fe and Al oxides and allophane) when TSP was applied and highest for H2SO4-Pi (predominantly calcium phosphates or apatite-type P minerals) when BGPR was applied. The largest pool of soil P, the NaOH-Po (labile organic P), was unaffected by the P fertilizer applications. The rate of NaOH-Pi concentration increase was higher in the higher P fixing Allophanic Soil than in the Pumice Soil. Both types of fertilizers increased resin-Pi (Inorganic P freely available to the plant) and Bray-2 P concentrations but only the TSP application increased Olsen P concentration. Phosphorus derived from TSP and BGPR applications moved down to 10-20 cm soil depth within 2 years of application in the Pumice Soil, but did not move below 10 cm depth in the higher P fixing and less porous Allophanic Soil. The fertilizers significantly increased needle P concentrations 2, 3 and 4 years after fertilizer application, but did not have any significant effect on tree growth.
