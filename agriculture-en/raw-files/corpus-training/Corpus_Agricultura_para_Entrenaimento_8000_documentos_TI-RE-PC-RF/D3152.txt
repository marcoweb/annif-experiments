#ITI#In vitro differentiation and plant regeneration from root and other explants of juvenile origin in pea (Pisum sativum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#In vitro regeneration of pea explants (Pisum sativum L. var. ‘Lincon’) was done in 49 different combinations and concentrations of BAP, BAP and NAA, BAP and IBA, TDZ, TDZ and Adenine for shoot regeneration from hypocotyl, root, leaf and cotyledonary node. High frequency shoot regeneration was obtained in hypocotyl (81.43%), root(83.53%) and cotyledonary node(72.76%) on MS medium supplemented with 4.50 mg/l BAP and 1.86mg/l NAA, 2.00mg/l TDZ and4.50 mg/l BAP and 1.86mg/l NAA respectively. No shoot regeneration was obtained from leaf explants on any of the combination used. Shoot elongation was observed on the same medium used for shoot regeneration respectively.MS medium supplemented with 0.20 mg/l IBA was found best for root regeneration from in vitro raised shoots. The plantlets were able to regenerate within 6-7 weeks. The regenerated plantlets were acclimatized in pre-sterilized cocopeat. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
