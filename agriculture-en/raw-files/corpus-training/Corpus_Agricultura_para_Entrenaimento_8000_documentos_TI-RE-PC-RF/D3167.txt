#ITI#Application of DNA markers in determination of fusarium resistance and genetic diversity in chickpea#FTI#
#IRE#Genetic diversity and fusarium resistance of 50 cultivated chickpea genotypes was studied using ISSR and RAPD markers. The results of both marker systems were consistent with each other, but was somewhat higher for RAPDs. A total of 48 fragments were obtained with both markers together, 32.7% of which were polymorphic. Molecular characterisation through ISSR and RAPD data indicated low genetic variation (GDI=0.39; PIC=0.21) among local and introduced chickpea accessions. The genetic distance values ranged from 0 to 0.134, with a mean of 0.05. The low genetic diversity indicated that new genotypes must be introduced to increase the variability of chickpea germplasm in Azerbaijan. As a result of screening for resistance to fusarium most of genotypes were found to have 600 bp fragment of OPJ20 linked with Foc01 resistance gene, while none of them had resistance gene to Foc4. The results could provide information for future chickpea breeding activities and conservation. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
