#ITI#Study on irrigation levels based on iw/cpe ratio and irrigation methods on growth and yield of fenugreek (Trigonella foenium graecum l.)#FTI#
#IRE#The current study was carried out to investigate the effect of different irrigation methods with water level based on IW/CPE ratio on growth and seed yield of fenugreek during the rabi season of 2 consecutive years (2016-17) at ICAR-National Research Centre on Seed Spices (NRCSS), Tabiji, Ajmer, Rajasthan. This investigation consisted of four irrigation regimes (IW/CPE ratio viz 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) and three irrigation methods i.e. (Micro sprinkler, Drip irrigation and Surface irrigation). The experiment was laid out in factorial randomized block design with four replications. Among the irrigation methods tested, drip and micro sprinkler system gave maximum irrigation efficiency and minimum yield loss than surface irrigation. Results showed that irrigation regimes 0.6 IW/CPE ratio with drip irrigation gave superior seed yields (2049.80 kg ha-1) of fenugreek compared to other treatments. Total water applied was 321.96 mm by different irrigation methods. Water productivity and water use efficiency was found highest in 0.4 IW/CPE ratio followed by 0.6 IW/CPE ratio from the finding of the investigation. It was inferred that farmers were over irrigating their farms without equivalent returns. The water saved through use of optimized irrigation method and level can be used more profitably to irrigate supplemental lands, thus achieving a more efficient and rational use of land and water resources. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
