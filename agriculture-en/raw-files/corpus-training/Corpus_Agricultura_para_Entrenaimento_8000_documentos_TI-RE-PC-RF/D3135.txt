#ITI#Management of fusarium wilt of chickpea using brassicas as biofumigants#FTI#
#IRE#Phasing out of methyl bromide has resulted in the need for alternative strategies for the management of soilborne pests and diseases. Among several bioactive molecules, glucosinolates from Brassicaceae and their enzymatic degradation products, especially isothiocyanates formed by myrosinase enzyme, stand out as a promising alternative biofumigants. The effectiveness of biocidal compounds released from brassica species Sinapis alba L. (syn. Brassica alba L.), B. nigra L., B. napus L., B. rapa L., B. juncea L. and B. carinata} tissue degradation on Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris (Padwick) Matuo & K.Sato (F.o.c.; causal agent of chickpea wilt) growth in vitro, propagule attrition in soil and incidence of chickpea wilt in the field was carried out. Brassica alba L. was found to be the most toxic as it resulted in maximum percent mycelial growth inhibition of the pathogen followed by B. nigra L. and B. juncea L. tissues. Under glasshouse conditions, B. nigra was found most effective in reducing the colony forming units of the pathogen followed by B. alba L. and B. juncea L.. Lowest wilt severity under field conditions was observed in B. juncea L. tissues while greatest grain yield was produced in B. alba L. amended plots. The present study showed that the soil amendment with brassicas might be a feasible non-chemical approach to manage fusarium wilt of chickpea. Â© 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
