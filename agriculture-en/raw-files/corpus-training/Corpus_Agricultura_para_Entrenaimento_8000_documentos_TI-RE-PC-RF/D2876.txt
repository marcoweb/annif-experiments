#ITI#Correlation and path analysis for yield and yield components in black gram [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper]#FTI#
#IRE#Thirty six genotypes of black gram were studied in randomized block design with three replications for correlations, and direct and indirect effects for fifteen quantitative characters. The yield contributing characters viz., plant height, number of branches per plant, number of clusters per plant, number of pods per plant, number of pods per cluster, length of pod, number of seeds per pod and dry matter per plant had strong positive association with seed yield per plant at both the phenotypic and genotypic level. The characters days to first flowering, number of clusters per plant, number of pods per cluster, length of pod, 100-seed weight, dry matter per plant, harvest index, number of seeds per pod and number of branches per plant had positive direct effect on seed yield per plant at genotypic level. The selection based on number of clusters per plant, number of pods per plant, dry matter per plant, plant height, number of branches per plant, number of seeds per pod, length of pod and number of pods per cluster could help in genetic improvement of seed yield per plant in black gram population under study.#FRE#
