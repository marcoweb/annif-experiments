#ITI#Yield and profitability of fenugreek (Trigonella Foenum-Graecum) as influenced by irrigation and nutrient levels with varying crop geometry#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was conducted during rabi season of 2003-06 to study growth, profitability and productivity of fenugreek as influenced by irrigation and nutrients levels with varying crop geometry.Three irrigation levels (8,12 and 15 days interval) in main plot, nutrient levels (N and P 2O 5 each of 20+10,30 +20 and 40+25 kg /ha, respectively) in sub plot and crop geometry (20 cm × 10 cm, 25 cm × 10 cm and 30 cm × 10 cm) in sub-sub plot were studied in split-split plot design with three replications. The maximum plant height and dry matter accumulation per plant at all the growth stages as well as number of branches per plant at harvest (3.84) and yield attributes, seed yield (1120 kg /ha), net return (35086) and BCR(1.68) in fenugreek was obtained highest with application of irrigation at 12 days interval. Application of 30+20 kg N and P 2O 5 per ha gave higher yield attributes, seed yield(1121 kg /ha) net return (Rs 34465/ha) and BCR (1.62) being at par with 40 + 25 kg N and P 2O 5. The Crop geometry of 25 × 10 cm resulted 10 per cent higher seed yield over 20 ×10 cm crop geometry. Thus, application of irrigation at 12 days interval with combined application of 30 kg N and 20 kg P 2 O 5 /ha at 25 cm × 10 cm crop geometry is better for realizing higher yield, productivity and net return in fenugreek.#FRE#
