#ITI#Molecular characterization of a poxvirus isolated from an American Flamingo (Phoeniconais ruber rubber)#FTI#
#IRE#An avian poxvirus from the beak scab of an American flamingo (Phoeniconais ruber rubber) was isolated by inoculation on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos. The virus produced multifocal areas of epithelial hyperplasia along with foci of inflammation in the CAM, and rare cells contained small eosinophilic intracytoplasmic bodies. Chickens inoculated with the isolated virus in the feather follicle of the leg did not develop significant lesions. Nucleotide sequence comparison of a PCR-amplified 4.5 kb HindIII fragment of the genome of flamingo poxvirus (FlPV) revealed very high homology (99.7%) with condor poxvirus (CPV), followed by approximately 92% similarity with canary poxvirus (CNPV) and Hawaiian goose poxvirus (HGPV), but less similarity (âˆ¼69%) to fowl poxvirus (FPV), the type species of the genus Avipoxvirus of family Poxviridae. As in the cases with CPV, CNPV, and HGPV, genetic analysis of FlPV revealed an absence of three corresponding FPV open reading frames (ORF199, 200, and 202) and an absence of any reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) sequences in this region. There are only nine nucleotide substitutions observed between FlPV and CPV in the 4.5 kb fragment; those were clustered in the ORF201 region, which in FPV genome is a site for integration of REV sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of the ORF201-coded hypothetical protein demonstrated FlPV to be more closely related to CPV, as well as to CNPV and HGPV, than to FPV.#FRE#
