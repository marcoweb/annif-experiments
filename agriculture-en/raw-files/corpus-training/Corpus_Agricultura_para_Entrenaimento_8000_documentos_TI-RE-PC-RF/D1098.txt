#ITI#Responsiveness to long days for flowering is reduced in Arabidopsis by yearly variation in growing season temperatures#FTI#
#IRE#Conservative flowering behaviours, such as flowering during long days in summer or late flowering at a high leaf number, are often proposed to protect against variable winter and spring temperatures which lead to frost damage if premature flowering occurs. Yet, due the many factors in natural environments relative to the number of individuals compared, assessing which climate characteristics drive these flowering traits has been difficult. We applied a multidisciplinary approach to 10 winter-annual Arabidopsis thaliana populations from a wide climactic gradient in Norway. We used a variable reduction strategy to assess which of 100 climate descriptors from their home sites correlated most to their flowering behaviours when tested for responsiveness to photoperiod after saturation of vernalization; then, assessed sequence variation of 19 known environmental-response flowering genes. Photoperiod responsiveness inversely correlated with interannual variation in timing of growing season onset. Time to flowering appeared driven by growing season length, curtailed by cold fall temperatures. The distribution of FLM, TFL2 and HOS1 haplotypes, genes involved in ambient temperature response, correlated with growing-season climate. We show that long-day responsiveness and late flowering may be driven not by risk of spring frosts, but by growing season temperature and length, perhaps to opportunistically maximize growth. © 2023 The Authors.
