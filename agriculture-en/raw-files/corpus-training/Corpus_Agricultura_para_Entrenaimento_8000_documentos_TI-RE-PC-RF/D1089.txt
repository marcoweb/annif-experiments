#ITI#Genomic insight into changes of root architecture under drought stress in maize#FTI#
#IRE#Drought stress is a central environmental factor that severely limits maize production worldwide. Root architecture plays an important role in drought tolerance and can be targeted in breeding programmes. Here, we conducted phenotyping of root architecture under different water treatments for 373 maize inbred lines, representative germplasm from both China and the United States in different breeding eras. We found that seminal root length in response to drought stress experienced convergent increase during breeding in both countries. Using a genome-wide association study, we identified a total of 221 associated loci underlying 13 root traits under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. These loci harboured many reported root- and abiotic stress-related genes. Furthermore, a total of 75 strong candidate genes were prioritised by integrating candidate genes associated with seminal root length and differentially expressed genes in seminal root. One of high-confidence candidate genes, ZmCIPK3 was functionally characterised and probably plays a role in enhancing drought tolerance through regulating seminal root growth. This study provides valuable information for genetic improvement of root architecture and drought tolerance in maize. Â© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
