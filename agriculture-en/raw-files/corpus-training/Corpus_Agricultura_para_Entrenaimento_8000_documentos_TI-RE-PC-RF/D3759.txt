#ITI#Study on the potential use of essential oils for decay control and quality preservation of tabarzeh table grape#FTI#
#IRE#Borytis cinerea is responsible for the most postharvest losses of table grape. In the current research, the effect of essential oils extracted from sweet basil, fennel, summer savory and thyme plants were investigated both on mycelial growth of B. cinerea under in vitro condition and on fungal decay and quality sensors of table grape [Vitis vinifera (L.) cv. Tabarzeh] under in vivo conditions. Results showed that essential oils especially thyme, fennel and summer savory oils had a high inhibitory effect on mycelial growth of B. cinerea. Under in vivo assays, thyme and summer savory oils were able to reduce fungal decay sensory on table grape after 60 days of storage. In addition, essential oils had significant efficacy on quality parameters of fruit reducing a weight loss, berry shrinkage and berry and rachis browning. Also essential oil treatment increased the maturity index levels in treated fruits in comparison with controls. GC/MS analysis showed that linalool (65.25%), trans-anethole (64.72%), carvacrol (54.14%) and Î²-ocimene (12.62%) were the main compounds identified in sweet basil, fennel, summer savory and thyme oils, respectively. Results obtained from presented study showed that essential oils especially these one containing more phenolic compounds had a great antifungal activity and could be used as a benefit and safe tool for preservation of table grape.#FRE#
