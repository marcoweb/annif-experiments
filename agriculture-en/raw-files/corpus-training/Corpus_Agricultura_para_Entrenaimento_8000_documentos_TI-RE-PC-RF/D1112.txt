#ITI#Dark respiration explains nocturnal stomatal conductance in rice regardless of drought and nutrient stress#FTI#
#IRE#The ecological mechanism underlying nocturnal stomatal conductance (gsn) in C3 and C4 plants remains elusive. In this study, we proposed a ‘coordinated leaf trait’ hypothesis to explain gsn in rice plants. We conducted an open-field experiment by applying drought, nutrient stress and the combined drought–nutrient stress. We found that gsn was neither strongly reduced by drought nor consistently increased by nutrient stress. With the aforementioned multiple abiotic stressors considered as random effects, gsn exhibited a strong positive correlation with dark respiration (Rn). Notably, gsn primed early morning (5:00–7:00) photosynthesis through faster stomatal response time. This photosynthesis priming effect diminished after mid-morning (9:00). Leaves were cooled by gsn-derived transpiration. However, our results clearly suggest that evaporative cooling did not reduce dark respiration cost. Our results indicate that gsn is more closely related to carbon respiration and assimilation than water and nutrient availability, and that dark respiration can explain considerable variation of gsn. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
