#ITI#Lack of interaction between avian leukosis virus subgroup J and fowl adenovirus (FAV) in FAV-antibody-positive chickens#FTI#
#IRE#Unfounded field speculation has suggested that avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) predisposes young meat-type chickens to inclusion body hepatitis caused by fowl adenovirus (FAV). To address this hypothesis, we infected 1-day-old grandparent meat-type chickens carrying maternal antibodies against FAV with a field isolate of FAV associated with inclusion body hepatitis in broilers, ALV-J, or both FAV and ALV-J. We examined the effects of FAV alone or in combination with ALV-J on the basis of clinical signs, overall mortality, growth rate, and gross and microscopic lesions. With such criteria for evaluating possible interactions, we found no significant differences in the dually infected birds in comparison with chickens that received a monovalent challenge with either FAV or ALV-J.#FRE#
