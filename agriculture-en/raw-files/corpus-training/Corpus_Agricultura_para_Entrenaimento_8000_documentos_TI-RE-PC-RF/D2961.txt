#ITI#In-situ rainwater conservation techniques with integrated phosphorus management on consumptive use of moisture, moisture use efficiency and productivity of pigeonpea under dryland conditions#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted to find out the effect of in-situ rainwater conservation techniques with integrated phosphorous management on consumptive use of moisture, moisture use efficiency and productivity of pigeonpea under dryland condition during the kharif season 2007-08 to 2011-12 at Zonal Agricultural Research Station, Solapur (Maharashtra). The pooled results revealed that in situ rain water conservation technique, flat sowing with one hoeing at 3rd week and opening of ridges and furrows at 30 days after sowing gave significantly higher grain and stalk (754 and 3323 kg ha-1) yield and has attributed to increased availability of soil water in the soil profile. Among the integrated phosphorus management, the application of 12.5 kg N ha-1 + 25 kg P2O5ha-1through DAP + Rhizobium + PSB registered significantly higher grain and stalk (897 and 3409 kg ha-1) yield over control with increased water use efficiency by 1.52 kg ha-1 mm-1. The higher soil moisture (136 mm),consumptive use of moisture (611mm) and moisture use efficiency (1.25 kg ha-1 mm-1) were conserved with the flat sowing with one hoeing at 3rd week and opening of ridges and furrow 30 days after sowing. Flat sowing + One hoeing +Opening of furrows at 30 DAS along with recommended dose of fertilizer 12.5:25 kg ha-1 N: P2O5 through DAP +Rhizobium +PSB is recommended for increased pigeonpea yield and water productivity through in situ rain water conservation techniques in dryland conditions. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
