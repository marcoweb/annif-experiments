#ITI#Effect of Different Doses of Panchgavya on Productivity of Moth Bean [Vigna aconitifolia (Jacq.) Marechal]#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The panchgavya, an liquid organic manure has the potential to play the role in promoting growth and providing immunity in the plant system, resulting in increased overall yields. Hence, the present study was carried out to assess the fertilization effect of panchgavya on growth, yield and qualitative traits of moth bean in semi-arid environment. Methods: A field experiment was conducted at Agronomy Research Farm, Sri Karan Narendra Agriculture University, Jobner, Rajasthan to study the effect of different levels of Panchgavya (2.5%, 5% and 7.5% each at 20 DAS (days after sowing), 35 DAS and 20 DAS + 35 DAS, respectively) on growth and yield of mothbean. The field experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with three replications comprising of 10 treatments. Result: Application of 5% Panchgavya at 20 DAS + 35 DAS in mothbean resulted in significantly higher grain yield and net return in comparison to control. Thus, the study recommended the correct concentration of Panchgavya (5%) for enhancing moth bean productivity in the Rajasthan and similar eco-regions elsewhere for nutritional security.
