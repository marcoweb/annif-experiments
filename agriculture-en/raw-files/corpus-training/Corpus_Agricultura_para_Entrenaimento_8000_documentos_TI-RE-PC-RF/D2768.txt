#ITI#Population dynamics of major phototactic insect pests of chickpea ecosystem through light trap#FTI#
#IRE#An investigation was carried out at Experimental Farm, JNKVV, Jabalpur (MP) during 2016-2017 to know the population dynamics of major phototactic insect pests using Jawahar light trap in chickpea ecosystem. The present study revealed that gram pod borer was first recorded during 45th SW in light trap. The activity period of Helicoverpa armigera was noticed from November 2016 to April 2017 with two distinct peaks during 13th and 14th SW. The highest peak was observed in 14thSW. Cutworm was first recorded during 46th SW in light trap. Three distinct peaks were observed during 4th, 12th and 16th SW with highest peak was observed in 12th SW. Tobacco caterpillar was also firstly recorded during 46th SW in light trap with one distinct peak during 13th SW. Further, the correlation studies revealed that maximum temperature, minimum temperature, sunshine, wind velocity, morning vapor pressure and evaporation showed significant positive correlation whilemorning relative humidity and evening relative humidity, showed negative correlation with Helicoverpa armigera, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) and Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) moth catches and statistically found significant except wind velocity which wasnon-significant against Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel). Rest of the weather parameters were found non-significant. Â© 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
