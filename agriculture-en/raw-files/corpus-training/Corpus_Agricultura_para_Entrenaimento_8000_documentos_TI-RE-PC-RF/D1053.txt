#ITI#A MYB activator, DcMYB11c, regulates carrot anthocyanins accumulation in petiole but not taproot#FTI#
#IRE#The first domesticated carrots were thought to be purple carrots rich in anthocyanins. The anthocyanins biosynthesis in solid purple carrot taproot was regulated by DcMYB7 within P3 region containing a gene cluster of six DcMYBs. Here, we described a MYB gene within the same region, DcMYB11c, which was highly expressed in the purple pigmented petioles. Overexpression of DcMYB11c in ‘Kurodagosun’ (KRDG, orange taproot carrot with green petioles) and ‘Qitouhuang’ (QTHG, yellow taproot carrot with green petioles) resulted in deep purple phenotype in the whole carrot plants indicating anthocyanins accumulation. Knockout of DcMYB11c in ‘Deep Purple’ (DPPP, purple taproot carrot with purple petioles) through CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing resulted in pale purple phenotype due to the dramatic decrease of anthocyanins content. DcMYB11c could induce the expression of DcbHLH3 and anthocyanins biosynthesis genes to jointly promote anthocyanins biosynthesis. Yeast one-hybrid assay (Y1H) and dual-luciferase reporter assay (LUC) revealed that DcMYB11c bound to the promoters of DcUCGXT1 and DcSAT1 and directly activated the expression of DcUCGXT1 and DcSAT1 responsible for anthocyanins glycosylation and acylation, respectively. Three transposons were present in the carrot cultivars with purple petioles but not in the carrot cultivars with green petioles. We revealed the core factor, DcMYB11c, involved in anthocyanins pigmentation in carrot purple petioles. This study provides new insights into precise regulation mechanism underlying anthocyanins biosynthesis in carrot. The orchestrated regulation mechanism in carrot might be conserved across the plant kingdom and useful for other researchers working on anthocyanins accumulation in different tissues. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
