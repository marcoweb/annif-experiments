#ITI#Correlation and path analysis for yield and yield attributes in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.)#FTI#
#IRE#The estimate of genotypic correlation coefficients in general higher than their corresponding phenotypic correlations indicating strong inherent association among the traits. Pod yield per plant had significant positive association with plant height, shelling per cent and sound mature kernel per cent, while its association with other characters viz., number of mature pods per plant and kernel yield per plant was found to be positive but non-significant. These characters can be considered as criteria for selection for higher yield, as these were mutually and directly associated with pod yield. The maximum positive direct positive effect on pod yield per plant was contributed by kernel yield per plant followed by number of well-filled and mature pods per plant, plant height and sound mature kernel per cent. The high direct effect of pods per plant appeared to be the main factor for its strong positive correlation with pod yield. Hence, a direct selection for this trait would be effective.
