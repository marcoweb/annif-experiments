#ITI#Comparison of biochemical responses of common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) seedling organs to salinity#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Shoots and roots are autotrophic and heterotrophic organs of plants with different physiological and biochemical functions under stress conditions. The metabolites involved in tolerance enhancement differed between roots and shoots. In this study, the biochemical changes occurring in shoot and root organs under salt stress and the level of these changes were investigated. However, these changes in shoot and root organs were compared. Methods: Seeds of common vetch were sown and subjected to 14 days of salt stress in basal MS medium containing 100 mM NaCl. In shoot and root tissue, biochemical parameters such as antioxidant enzymes activities (GR, APX, SOD and CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) content and proline accumulation were determined. Result: Results of the study indicated that the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT (except in shoot), GR and APX), MDA and proline accumulation enhanced by salt stress in both organs. On the other hand, morphological parameters decreased in both tissues. It seemed that antioxidant enzyme activities more active in root tissues. However, proline accumulation was found higher in shoot tissues than root tissue, while MDA content was higher in root tissue than shoot tissue. The present investigation provides essential information for the antioxidant components of the shoot and root organs of vetch seedlings under salt stress. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
