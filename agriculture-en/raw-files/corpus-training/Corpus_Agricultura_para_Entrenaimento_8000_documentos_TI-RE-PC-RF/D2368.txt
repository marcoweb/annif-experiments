#ITI#Nutrient redistribution by grazing cattle drives patterns of topsoil N and P stocks in a low-input pasture ecosystem#FTI#
#IRE#Nutrient cycles in grassland often involve net transfers from some areas to others. Here, we analyse patterns of N and P transfers by cattle in two grazing periods, and their relationships to soil P and N stocks in an unfertilised old pasture with a history of >50 years grazing. Net transfers were assessed from spatial patterns of nutrient ingestion and excretion. Total soil N and P were determined at 0-5, 5-10, 10-30 and 30-60 cm. All analyses were performed with a spatial resolution of 10 × 10 m2 or higher. Data were geostatistically interpolated. Nutrients accumulated in the flat crest zone and were depleted in the steeper areas. Nutrient ingestion was less and excretion higher in the accumulation zone (and vice versa in the depletion zone) revealing that both components of grazer-driven net transfers of nutrients promoted the development of accumulation/depletion zones. Topsoil stocks of N and P were closely correlated with excreta density and net transfers of N (P < 0.001), whereas N and P at 30-60 cm displayed only weak or no correlation. Redistribution involved a small fraction of the soil stocks: nutrients grazed in two periods were equivalent to 0.8% of N and 0.2% of P of the whole pasture (0-60 cm). These factors suggest that topsoil nutrient distribution was modified by long-term stable patterns of net transfers of nutrients. The excess of N in the accumulation zone (N in accumulation zone minus N in depletion zone, in 0-60 cm) was 11 times larger than that of annual (i. e. short-term) net transfers; but for P, it was 30 times larger. This contrast likely derived from leaching/volatilization losses of N in the accumulation zone and only small inputs of biologically fixed N in the depletion zone. The nitrogen status of vegetation (Nitrogen Nutrition Index) had a strong effect on herbage production throughout the pasture, while the Phosphorus Nutrition Index indicated no limitation, except in urine patches. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
