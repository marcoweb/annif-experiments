#ITI#Dormancy breaking and seed germination of the annual weeds Thlaspi arvense, Descurainia sophia and Malcolmia africana (Brassicaceae)#FTI#
#IRE#In Iran, Descurainia sophia, Malcolmia africana, and Thlaspi arvense are abundantly found as importunate weeds in winter cereal. Understanding the timing of seed germination under natural conditions is crucial for learning how to manage these annual weeds. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of soil burial, dry storage, cold stratification, KNO3, GA3, and scarification on the seed dormancy and germination of these three species. Species had significantly different responses to the treatment. In D. sophia, seeds buried at a depth of 10 cm for 60 days (55%), and seeds dry stored at 20Â°C for 180 days (45%) showed the highest level of germination. In M. africana, the germination percentage reached 95% when seeds buried at a depth of 1 cm were soaked in a GA3 concentration of 150 ppm. T. arvense had the lowest level of germination compared to the other species. The highest percentage of T. arvense germination was obtained in seeds treated with 150 ppm GA3. Potassium nitrate partly increased germinability in seeds of M. africana, which initially were less dormant than those of T. arvense and D. sophia.#FRE#
