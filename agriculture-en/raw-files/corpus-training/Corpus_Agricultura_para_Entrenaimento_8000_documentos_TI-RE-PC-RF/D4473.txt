#ITI#Preparation for the prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza in rural Tanzanian village settings#FTI#
#IRE#Free-ranging local chicken flocks are important for the livelihood of resource-poor rural farmers in Tanzania, as they provide a critical source of animal protein and a ready source of income through the sale of chickens and eggs. An occurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in the village setting of Tanzania would result in a disastrous loss of livelihood. This paper attempts to offer an alternative method for preventing and controlling HPAI in village settings of Tanzania through community-based approaches.
