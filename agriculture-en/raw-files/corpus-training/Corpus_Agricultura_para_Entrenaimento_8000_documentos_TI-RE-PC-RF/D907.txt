#ITI#Metabolomics analysis of the nutraceutical diversity and physiological quality of Torreya yunnanensis seeds during cold storage#FTI#
#IRE#This study investigated how cold storage affects the nutraceutical diversity and physiological quality of Torreya yunnanensis seeds, using a widely targeted UPLC-MS/MS-based metabolomics analysis. The 373 identified metabolites were divided into nine categories: lipids, phenolic acids, amino acids and derivatives, organic acids, nucleotides, saccharides, vitamins and alcohols. Among them, 49 metabolites showed significant changes after 3 months of cold storage, affecting 28 metabolic pathways. The content of amino acid-related metabolites significantly increased, while the content of sugar-related metabolites decreased during storage. Notably, the content of proline acid, shikimic acid, α-linolenic acid and branched-chain amino acids showed significant changes, indicating their potential role in seed storage. This study deepens our understanding of the nutraceutical diversity and physiological quality of T. yunnanensis seeds during storage, providing insight for conservation efforts and habitat restoration. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
