#ITI#Effect of different levels of nitrogen and potassium against leaf spots disease of groundnut in different fertility gradient soil in field#FTI#
#IRE#The occurrence of early and late leaf spots of groundnut under influence of variable soil fertility states with further interaction to different levels of nitrogen and potassium was measured and the same was correlated with the yield attributing parameters. Two different nitrogen and potassium combinations (20; 40 kg ha-1) applied on four different fertility gradient soil (low, S1; medium, S2; moderate, S3 and high, S4) showed minimum leaf spot disease severity and maximum diseases reduction in (S1) N40K20 (AUDPC 34.48 and 16.06% reduction); (S2) N40K40 (AUDPC-32.88 and 13.68% reduction); (S3) N20K40 (AUDPC 31.51 and 11.44% reduction) and (S4) N20K20 (AUDPC-25.40 and 11.58% reduction). The yield attributes like kernel number and weight per plant and kernel yield were also high in above combinations and fertility gradient soil. The linear regression value between disease severity and yield parameters showed a high co-relation regression and negatively significant at all fertility gradient soil and more responsive at low, medium and high fertility gradient soil irrespective of different N and K levels.
