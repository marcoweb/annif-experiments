#ITI#Determination of comprehensive quality index for tomato and its response to different irrigation treatments#FTI#
#IRE#In order to investigate better irrigation scheduling with the compromise between yield and quality of greenhouse-grown tomato under limit water supply, two experiments of different irrigation treatments were conducted in the arid region of northwest China during spring to summer in 2008 (2008 season) and winter in 2008 to summer in 2009 (2008-2009 season). After measuring single quality attributes, the analysis hierarchy process (AHP) and technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) were used to determine the weight of single quality attributes and comprehensive quality index, respectively. The results show that the rank of comprehensive quality index had good fitness to that of single quality attributes, indicating that the comprehensive quality index was reliable. Compared to full irrigation, applying 1/3 or 2/3 of full irrigation amount at the seedling stage had slight improvement of comprehensive quality and limit water saving. Applying 1/3 or 2/3 of full irrigation amount at the fruit maturation and harvesting stage decreased the yield by 23.0-40.9%, but had the best comprehensive quality. However, applying 1/3 of full irrigation amount at the flowering and fruit development stage significantly reduced crop water consumption and had obvious improvement of comprehensive quality, but did not decrease the yield significantly and water use efficiency in the 2008 season. And applying 2/3 of full irrigation amount at the flowering and fruit development stage significantly decreased crop water consumption and slightly improved the comprehensive quality, but did not decrease the yield significantly in the 2008-2009 season. Considering the water saving amount, yield and comprehensive quality, applying 1/3 or 2/3 of full irrigation amount at the flowering and fruit development stage and no water stress in other growth stages appears to be a better irrigation scheduling with the compromise between yield and quality of greenhouse-grown tomato, which can be recommended for the spring to summer and winter to summer seasons in the arid region of northwest China.
