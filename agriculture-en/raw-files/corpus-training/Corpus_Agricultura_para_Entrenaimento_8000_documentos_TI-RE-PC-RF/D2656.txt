#ITI#Assessment of genetic divergence in horsegram [macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.) verdc.] using quantitative traits#FTI#
#IRE#Genetic relatedness studies using 12 quantitative traits on 252 genotypes in horsegram revealed wide spectrum of variability for yield components. The genotypes were grouped into 25 clusters based on estimates of D2 statistic. Cluster I had the largest number with 83 genotypes followed by cluster II (77 genotypes), cluster IV (33 genotypes) and cluster III (30 genotypes). On the contrary, 20 solitary clusters from cluster V to XXV were formed except cluster XIV (9 genotypes) which could be given priority for specific trait improvement. Cluster XXI recorded the highest mean value for single plant yield (65.51 g). The intra and inter cluster distance was varying in magnitude indicating the presence of larger genetic diversity among accessions. The highest intra cluster distance was noticed in cluster XIV (23.63) followed by cluster IV (22.37). Maximum inter cluster distance was observed between solitary clusters viz., cluster XXI & XVII followed by cluster XXI & XV and cluster XXI & VII. These clusters would offer superior segregants when employed in hybridization programme. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
