#ITI#Nitrogen loss and rice profits with matrix-based slow-release urea#FTI#
#IRE#Paddy fields account for a large proportion of cultivated land, with huge N consumption each year. Reducing N loss via application of low-cost slow-release fertilizers is beneficial for eco-friendly rice production. The current study aimed to investigate the effects of matrix-based urea on soil N availability, rice yield, agronomical efficiency (AE), and rice profits. A 2-year field experiment was conducted during 2015 and 2016 following a randomized block design. It included three treatments, i.e., control test (CK, without urea application), common urea (CU, 150 kg N ha−1), and matrix-based urea (MU, 150 kg N ha−1). Besides, three laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the N leaching, ammonia volatilization, and slow-release mechanism. Results showed that application of MU increased rice yields by > 10%, biomass by > 6%, and AE by > 30% in both seasons. Greater yield, biomass, and AE in MU were largely attributed to higher soil available N, resulted from lower risk of N leaching and ammonia volatilization. Aggregate structure was partly responsible for lower N loss in MU. Greater soil available N in MU increased rice height, leaf area, root area, leaf total chlorophyll, and activity of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase in flag leaves, and thus favored rice growth. Compared with CU, MU increased fertilizer cost by about 23 USD ha−1, but increased rice profits by > 230 USD ha−1 due to greater yield. Overall, matrix-based urea is suitable for application in field rice production, due to its low risk of N loss and acceptable profitability. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.#FRE#
