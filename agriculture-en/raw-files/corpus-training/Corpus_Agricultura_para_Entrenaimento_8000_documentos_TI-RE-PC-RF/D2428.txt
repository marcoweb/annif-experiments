#ITI#Presence of some mycotoxins in peanuts from harvest to storage#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, aflatoxin and cyclopiazonic acid levels on the second crop of peanuts collected from 102 different research areas of Osmaniye and Adana, Turkey in 2016 was determined from harvest, drying, pre-storage and storage. During the periods of the research, it was found that aflatoxin levels in 86 out of 102 contaminated samples were ranged from 0.2 to 2177.2 μg/kg. However, cyclopiazonic acid, another mycotoxin investigated in this study has not been found in any of the 102 peanut samples. When aflatoxin contamination compared in different periods; it was observed that the aflatoxin level in storage and drying (97%) periods were found to be higher than the harvest (66%) and pre-storage (71%). The statistical analysis showed that significant differences in the aflatoxins in drying, and storage periods. Therefore, for preventing grains from aflatoxins damage control management strategies need to be improved. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
