#ITI#Inheritance of Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus (MYMV) resistance in mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) wilczek]#FTI#
#IRE#Inheritance of resistance to Mungbean Yellow Mosaic Virus was studied in Fl, F2, BC1, BC2 populations of green gram involving two resistant cultivars (ML 818 and Safya) and two susceptible cultivars (SML 32 and Koppergoan) in the field. Two recessive genes were found responsible for MYMV resistance and cytoplasm has no role in inheritance of this disease. Additive, additive × additive, and dominance × dominance effects were negative for all the four crosses. Dominance and additive × dominance effects were positive, and additive × dominance had the greatest magnitude of any single effect. Dominance variance was larger than additive variance in all the four crosses. Broad sense heritabilities were high (0.81 to 0.83) in all crosses, indicating a large genetic component for MYMV resistance. Estimates of minimum number of effective factors (gene loci) controlling resistance to MYMV also confirmed the involvement of at least two genes. Progeny testing followed by between and within family selection of resistant plants is suggested to capitalize the major and modifying genes controlling resistance to MYMV.#FRE#
