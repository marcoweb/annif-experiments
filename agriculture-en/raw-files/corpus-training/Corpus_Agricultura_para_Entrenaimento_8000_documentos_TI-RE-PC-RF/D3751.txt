#ITI#Suppression of growth of fusarium verticillioides niren. Using strains of trichoderma harzianum from maize (Zea Mays) plant parts and its rhizosphere#FTI#
#IRE#Three strains of Trichoderma harzianum (strain 1: IMI 380934; strain 2: IMI 380935; strain 3: IMI 380938) were compared for their ability to suppress radial growth of Fusarium verticillioides in vitro. Each Trichoderma strain was paired with the pathogen F. verticillioides on 9 cm Petri plates of acidified potato dextrose agar using three pairing methods. Varying growth suppression of pathogen by Trichoderma strains was rated and ratings were analysed using GLM Procedure of SAS. Growth inhibition of F. verticillioides by each of the T. harzianum strains was significantly different from control irrespective of pairing method (p = 0.01, R2 = 0.96). Higher inhibition of F. verticillioides was obtained by inoculating antagonist before pathogen even at p = 0.01. Mode of suppression includes mycoparasitism and competition for space and nutrients. Growth inhibition of pathogen differed significantly among (p > 0.0001) and within (p > 0.026) pairing methods. T. harzianum strain 1 had better suppression of pathogen than the other two strains when it was inoculated before the pathogen while T. harzianum strain 3 was better when pathogen and antagonist were inoculated simultaneously (p = 0.05). Different strains of T. harzianum could thus be employed as promising antagonists of F. verticillioides.#FRE#
