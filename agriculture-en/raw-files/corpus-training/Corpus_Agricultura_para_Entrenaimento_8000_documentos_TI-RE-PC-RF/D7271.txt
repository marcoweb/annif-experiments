#ITI#Accounting for water use: Terminology and implications for saving water and increasing production#FTI#
#IRE#Scarcity and competition for water are matters of increasing concern, as are potential shortages of food. These issues intersect both within the agricultural sector and across all water using sectors. Irrigation is by far the largest user of water in most water-scarce countries, and is under pressure to reduce utilisation (to release water to other sectors, including the environment) and use water more productively to meet demands for food and fibre.The terminology for such intra- and inter-sectoral analysis must be unambiguous across sectors so that interventions and their impacts are properly understood. Such terminology, based on previous work and debate, is set out. Implications for a better understanding of the scope for improved productivity of water in agriculture are traced, and some examples are given using data from recent research submissions, demonstrating the benefits of precise water accounting.
