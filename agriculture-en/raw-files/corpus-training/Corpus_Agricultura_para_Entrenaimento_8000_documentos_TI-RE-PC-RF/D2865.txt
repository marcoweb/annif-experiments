#ITI#Laboratory evaluation of adaptation through seedling response to digitonin and indole-butyric-acid in mungbean#FTI#
#IRE#Evaluation of newly evolved crop genotypes for yielding ability/adaptation through field trial is expensive and time consuming. Simple laboratory predictive techniques for adaptation would reduce costs of field evaluation and save time. Seedling response to a few selected chemicals have been reported as a simple approach to such laboratory evaluation of adaptation (LEA). In the present study utility of two chemicals: digitonin and indol-butyric acid (IBA) in laboratory evaluation of adaptation in mung bean has been reported.#FRE#
