#ITI#Novel Insecticides for the Management of Pod Borer Complex in Pigeonpea Crop#FTI#
#IRE#The bioefficacy of novel insecticides against pod borer complex comprising Maruca vitrata (Fabricius) and Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) in pigeonpea was evaluated in multi location research trials during kharif 2016 to 2018. The data on efficacy of different insecticides against pod borer complex averaged at all the locations revealed that the application of chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 150 ml ha-1 followed by flubendiamide 480 SC @ 125 ml ha-1 registered significantly the lowest pest population and cumulative pod damage. These treatments registered significantly highest grain yield along with highest net returns over untreated control, thus, indicating their superiority over rest of the treatments.
