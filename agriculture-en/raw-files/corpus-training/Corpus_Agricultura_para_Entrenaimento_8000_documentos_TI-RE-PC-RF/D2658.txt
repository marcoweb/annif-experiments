#ITI#Introgression of vigna mungo genome into vigna radiata towards the broadening of genetic base for mymv resistance and yield attributes#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation was carried out at National Pulses Research Centre, Vamban to assess the introgression level of blackgram (Vigna mungo cv. Mash 114) genome into greengram (Vigna radiata cv. VBN(Gg)2) genome background through interspecific hybridization. Superior progenies with high yield potential and MYMV disease resistance were selected in F4 generation of cross VBN(Gg)2 and Mash 114 and evaluated in F5 generation. Based on per se and yield performance, six superior F5 progenies were selected and subjected to background analysis. A set of 84 SSR primers were surveyed and 33 SSRs were found to be polymorphic between parents. The results showed that 10.9 to 34.9 per cent of Vigna mungo genome was introgressed into Vigna radiata background. The proportion of homozygotes and heterozygotes among the progenies ranged from 5.4 to 28.8 and 7.2 to 22.2 per cent respectively. Among the six progenies surveyed, one progeny 3-10-19 recorded a maximum of 34.9% of blackgram genome. The present investigation showed the successful introgression of Vigna mungo genome into the Vigna radiata background. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
