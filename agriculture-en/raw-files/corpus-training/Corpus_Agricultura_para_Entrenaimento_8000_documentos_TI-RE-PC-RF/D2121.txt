#ITI#The availability of potassium in Aeric Haplaquept and Typic Haplustert as affected by long-term cropping, fertilization and manuring#FTI#
#IRE#The effect of long-term cropping, fertilization and manuring after 21 years of rice-rice cropping on an Aeric Haplaquept and after 27 years of soybean-wheat system on Typic Haplustert on the availability of potassium (K) using a Quantity-Intensity (Q/I) relationship was investigated at Bhubaneswar and Jabalpur, respectively in India. Q/I relationships of potassium provide general information on the nature of K equilibrium and serve as a good index of K supplying power of soil. The treatments selected for the study were: control (no fertilizer), nitrogen (N), nitrogen + phosphorus (NP), nitrogen + phosphorus + potassium (NPK) and NPK + farmyard manure (FYM). Nutrients N, P and K were applied at 200 kg N/ha, 52 kg P/ha and 100 kg K/ha in Aeric Haplaquept to the rice-rice system and 220 kg N/ha, 96 kg P/ha and 77 kg K/ha in Typic Haplustert to the soybean-wheat system. Farmyard manure was applied every year only to Kharif (wet season) rice at 10 t/ha (Aeric Haplaquept) and 15 t/ha to soybean crop (Typic Haplustert). In both soils the values of equilibrium activity ratio (AReK), the activity ratio of K in soil solution in equilibrium with the soil, non-specific or immediate available K and K on specific sites or difficultly available K were observed in the following order: NPK + FYM > NPK > control > N > NP. The magnitude of AReK < 0.001 (mol 1-1)1/2 showed that the K adsorption at edge positions was predominant in NP plots in the Typic Haplustert and in control, N and NP plots in the Aeric Haplaquept. The ΔK0 became more negative in the NPK and NPK + FYM treated plots, thereby indicating a greater K release into the soil solution. The potential buffering capacity, a measure of the ability of the soil to maintain the intensity of K in the soil solution was low in both the soils, irrespective of fertilizer treatments and indicated poor K release and low K supplying capacity of the soils. Free energies of exchange (ΔG) for the replacement of calcium with potassium ranged from -5348 to -3379 cal M-1 K-1 and were associated with potassium deficiencies in plants in both the soils. The Aeric Haplaquept had very low values of exchangeable + water soluble K, AReK, KL and ΔG, thereby indicating a K stress environment. The maximum and minimum contribution of non-exchangeable K to plant uptake were found for NP and NPK + FYM plots, respectively. The results suggest that continuous cropping without K inputs caused a greater decline in K supplying power of the soil and emphasise the need for balanced and integrated use of organic and K inputs regularly to sustain a steady supply of K to successive crops.#FRE#
