#ITI#Phenotypic and physiological responses to salt exposure in Sorghum reveal diversity among domesticated landraces#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Soil salinity negatively impacts plant function, development, and yield. To overcome this impediment to agricultural productivity, variation in morphological and physiological response to salinity among genotypes of important crops should be explored. Sorghum bicolor is a staple crop that has adapted to a variety of environmental conditions and contains a significant amount of standing genetic diversity, making it an exemplary species to study variation in salinity tolerance. Methods: Twenty-one diverse Sorghum accessions were treated with nonsaline water or 75 mM sodium chloride. Salinity tolerance was assessed via changes in biomass between control and salt-treated individuals. Accessions were first rank-ordered for salinity tolerance, and then individuals spanning a wide range of responses were analyzed for foliar proline and ion accumulation. Tolerance rankings were then overlaid on a neighbor-joining tree. Results: We found that, while proline is often a good indicator of osmotic adjustment and is historically associated with increased salt tolerance in many species, proline accumulation in sorghum reflects a stress response injury rather than acclimation. When combining ion profiles with stress tolerance indices, the variation observed in tolerance was not a sole result of Na+ accumulation, but rather reflected accession-specific mechanisms. Conclusions: We identified significant variation in salinity tolerance among Sorghum accessions that may be a result of the domestication history of Sorghum. When we compared our results with known phylogenetic relationships within sorghum, the most parsimonious explanation for our findings is that salinity tolerance was acquired early during domestication and subsequently lost in accessions growing in areas varying in soil salinity. © 2020 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
