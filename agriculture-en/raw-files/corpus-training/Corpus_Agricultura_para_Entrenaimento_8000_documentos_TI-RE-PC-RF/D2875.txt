#ITI#Induced polygenic variability and selection strategy for seed yield in grasspea (Lathyrus Sativus L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Genetic variation induced in grasspea cv. Dhenkanal local following mutagenesis varied with mutagens, generations and characters studied. Number of seeds, pods and seed yield/ plant were found to be docile for induced genetic variation. Treatments e.g., 40kR - γ -ray + 0.01% NG and 40kR γ-ray + 0.2% EMS + 0.01% NG induced appreciable genetic variation for seed yield with widest range, comparable mean value, high GCV, h 2(bs) and GA compared to control in M 2 and M 3. Whereas, 0.02-0.03% NG with similar consideration had higher genetic variability in M 3 than M 2 indicating release of additional variability and further scope for selection of high yielding mutants. In contrast, 0.01% NG might be amenable for direct selection as it had the highest mean seed yield per plant along with low GCV, h 2(bs) and GA.#FRE#
