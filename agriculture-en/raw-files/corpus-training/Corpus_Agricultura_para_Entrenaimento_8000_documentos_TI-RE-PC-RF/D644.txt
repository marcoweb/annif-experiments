#ITI#Analysis of the molecular mechanisms regulating how ZmEREB24 improves drought tolerance in maize (Zea mays) seedlings#FTI#
#IRE#Drought stress is one of the most limiting factors of maize productivity and can lead to a sharp reduction in the total biomass when it occurs at the seedling stage. Improving drought tolerance at the seedling stage is of great importance for maize breeding. The AP2/ERF transcription factor family plays a critical role in plant response to abiotic stresses. Here, we used a preliminary previously-generated ranscriptomic dataset to identify a highly drought-stress-responsive AP2 gene, i.e., ZmEREB24. Compared to the wild type, the overexpression of ZmEREB24 in maize significantly promotes drought tolerance of transgenic plants at the seedling stage. CRISPR/Cas9-based ZmEREB24-knockout mutants showed a drought-sensitive phenotype. RNA-seq analysis and EMSA assay revealed AATGG.CT and GTG.T.GCC motifs as the main binding sites of ZmEREB24 to the promoters of downstream target genes. DAP-seq identified four novel target genes involved in proline and sugar metabolism and hormone signal transduction of ZmEREB24. Our data indicate that ZmEREB24 plays important biological functions in regulating drought tolerance by binding to the promoters of drought stress genes and modulating their expression. The results further suggest a role of ZmEREB24 in regulating drought adaptation in maize, indicating its potential importance for employing molecular breeding in the development of high-yield drought-tolerant maize cultivars.
