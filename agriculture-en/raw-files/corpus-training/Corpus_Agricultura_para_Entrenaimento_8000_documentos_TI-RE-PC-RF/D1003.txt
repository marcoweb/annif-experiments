#ITI#The dual-specificity kinase MoLKH1-mediated cell cycle, autophagy, and suppression of plant immunity is critical for development and pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae#FTI#
#IRE#Cell cycle progression, autophagic cell death during appressorium development, and ROS degradation at the infection site are important for the development of rice blast disease. However, the association of cell cycle, autophagy and ROS detoxification remains largely unknown in M. oryzae. Here, we identify the dual-specificity kinase MoLKH1, which serves as an important cell cycle regulator required for appressorium formation by regulating cytokinesis and cytoskeleton in M. oryzae. MoLKH1 is transcriptionally activated by H2O2 and required for H2O2-induced autophagic cell death and suppression of ROS-activated plant defense during plant invasion of M. oryzae. In addition, the Molkh1 mutant also showed several phenotypic defects, including delayed growth, abnormal conidiation, damaged cell wall integrity, impaired glycogen and lipid transport, reduced secretion of extracellular enzymes and effectors, and attenuated virulence of M. oryzae. Nuclear localization of MoLKH1 requires the nuclear localization sequence, Lammer motif, as well as the kinase active site and ATP-binding site in this protein. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that each of them plays crucial roles in fungal growth and pathogenicity of M. oryzae. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MoLKH1-mediated cell cycle, autophagy, and suppression of plant immunity play crucial roles in development and pathogenicity of M. oryzae. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
