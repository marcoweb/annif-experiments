#ITI#Effect of chitosan polymer and inoculated with b. Japonicum on soybean germination survival of seedling, nodulation and bacteria viability on seeds#FTI#
#IRE#Chitosan is applied to stimulate seed germination and to extend in various crop species. The aim of this work was to evaluate a chitosan polymer on the viability of Bradyrhizobium japonicum on seeds and their effect to improve seed and bacteria survival and soybean nodulation in two application sequences inoculant- polymer and different storage times. The polymer did not affect the bacteria viability on seeds, neither seed survival. The application of chitosan before the inoculant had the best percentages of germinated seeds and the seedlings quality. Chitosan concentrations between 100 and 1000 mg L-1 favoured germination, the number of bacteria colonies on seeds and the soybean nodulation until 30 days of seed storage. © 2019, All Rights Reserved.#FRE#
