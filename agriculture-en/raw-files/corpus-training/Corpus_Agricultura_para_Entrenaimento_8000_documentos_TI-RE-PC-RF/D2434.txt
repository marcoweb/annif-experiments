#ITI#Influence of seed treatment with botanicals and chemicals on storability of kabuli chickpea (Cicer arietinum l.) varieties#FTI#
#IRE#The storage experiment was carried out at Seed Quality and Research Laboratory, Seed Unit (National Seed Project), University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad from March 2017 to March 2018 to study the influence of seed treatment with botanicals and chemicals on storability of Kabuli chickpea varieties. Seed quality parameters were significantly influenced among varieties and seed treatment with botanicals and chemicals. Among the treatments, seed treatment with Sprint (Mancozeb 50% + Carbendazim 25% WS) @ 2 g per kg of seed or Vitavax power @ 3 g/kg of seed or Sweet flag rhizome @ 10 g/kg of seed maintained seed quality for more than ten months during storage. However, Sweet flag rhizome @ 10 g/kg of seed can be used as alternative to chemicals which is safe, eco-friendly and economically feasible for maintaining seed quality for organic seed growers/producers and seed companies.
