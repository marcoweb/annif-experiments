#ITI#Influence of Foliar Application of Nutrient on Growth, Yield, Economics, Soil Nutritional Status and Nutrient Uptake of Soybean#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was carried out during kharif season of 2016 and 2017 at an experimental farm of MACS Agharkar Research Institute, Pune, India to study the influence of foliar application of nutrient on growth, yield, economics, soil nutritional status and nutrient uptake of soybean crop. An experiment was laid out in randomized block design (RBD) comprising of three replications and nine treatments. Recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) was applied as basal application to all treatments. Seven treatments consisted of different doses of nutrients as foliar application at pod initiation stage. Water spray at pod initiation stage and RDF alone were treated as control. The results revealed that, growth attributes, nodulation and its weight, morpho-physiological parameters, yield and its attributes, nutritional parameters and economics significantly differed by various foliar nutrition treatments except control and RDF + water spray. RDF + Urea 2% (3098 kg ha-1) gave significantly higher seed yield over control (2704 kg ha-1) and RDF + water spray (2686 kg ha-1) but was at par with RDF + DAP 2% (3050 kg ha-1), RDF + MOP 0.5% (2992 kg ha-1) and RDF + Molybdenum 0.5% (2955 kg ha-1). The increase in seed yield with foliar application of 2% Urea along with RDF was 14.57% over control and 15.34% over RDF + water spray. Higher net returns (Rs. 49,006/-ha-1) and benefit: cost ratio (2.23:1) was obtained in treatment RDF + Urea 2% followed by RDF + DAP 2% foliar spray. Availability of N, P and K was significantly higher with treatment RDF + Urea 2% foliar spray over control and RDF + water spray. N and P uptake by soybean plants was significantly higher in treatment RDF + 2% Urea over RDF + water spray and RDF alone (control). Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
