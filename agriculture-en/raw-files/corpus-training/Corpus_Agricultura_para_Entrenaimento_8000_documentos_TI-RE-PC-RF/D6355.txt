#ITI#Photosynthetic and morphological acclimation of seedlings of tropical lianas to changes in the light environment#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the study: Few studies have analyzed the physiological performance of different life stages and the expression of ontogenetic niche shifts in lianas. Here, we analyzed the photosynthetic and morphological acclimation of seedlings of Stigmaphyllon lindenianum, Combretum fruticosum, and Bonamia trichantha to distinctive light conditions in a tropical dry forest and compared their response with the acclimation response of adult canopy lianas of the same species. We expected acclimation to occur faster through changes in leaf photochemistry relative to adaptation in morphology, consistent with the life history strategies of these lianas.#FRE#
