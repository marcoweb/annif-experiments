#ITI#Exploration of molecular variability in rhizoctonia bataticola, the incitant of root rot disease of pulse crops#FTI#
#IRE#The present study explored pathogenic and genetic variability among the eleven isolates of Rhizoctonia bataticola (Taub.) Butler from different pulse crops. Based on morphological characters, 11 isolates were categorized into three groups viz., linear, fluffy, and linear at the end with fluffy growth at the center. Isolates also showed variability in sclerotial characters (intensity and shape) and intensity of pigment synthesis. All isolates were more aggressive on the original host from which it was isolated, which was shown by the variability in pathogenic characters. RAPD-PCR analysis has shown that genetic clustering agreed with the above findings in dendrogram analysis (2 clusters A and B). The black gram root isolates showed a maximum genetic similarity of 73 % with soya bean shoot isolate. Red gram shoot isolate showed 61% genetic similarity with green gram isolates. The findings from this study confirm the variability in R. bataticola isolates from pulses, according to their pathological as well as genetic characters. In the future, variability in pathogens will determine effective management practices.#FRE#
