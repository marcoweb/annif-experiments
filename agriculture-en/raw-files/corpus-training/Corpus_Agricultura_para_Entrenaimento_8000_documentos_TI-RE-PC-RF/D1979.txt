#ITI#Biogas slurry use as N fertilizer for two-season Zizania aquatica Turcz. in China#FTI#
#IRE#The development of ecological circular agriculture has been highly encouraged by the Chinese government to recycle agricultural wastes, reduce mineral fertilizer input, and protect the environment. Biogas slurry, a byproduct of biogas engineering developed in rural areas of China, could be used as N fertilizer for crop growth. The field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 to study the plant growth responses and environmental impacts of applying biogas slurry to two-season Zizania aquatica Turcz. growth. The potential factors that restrict the rational use of biogas slurry were also clarified. Mineral N fertilizer can be completely or partly substituted by N fertilizer from biogas slurry to satisfy Z. aquatica plant growth. It was not at the cost of sacrificing yield, dry matter accumulation, N accumulation and physiological N use efficiency in the above-ground parts. However, the growth inhibition occurs when the N quantity in biogas slurry was 2 or 2.7 times higher than that of mineral N fertilizer. Vitamin C in non-shell swollen culms (as edible part) of Z. aquatica significantly increased after biogas slurry application. Biogas slurry application substantially increased the N concentrations, i.e., total N, NH4         +–N, and NO3         −–N in floodwater and delayed the time to reach national discharge standards. However, biogas slurry application did not affect the N concentrations in percolating water compared with the treatment with mineral N fertilizer only. Applying biogass slurry did not generate potential pollution risks by trace elements (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cd, As, and Hg) in the non-shell swollen culm and soil, and did not increase the nitrate content in non-shell swollen culm. We found the NH4         +–N concentration in biogas slurry can account for 77–93% of total N and reflects the N level in biogas slurry to a great degree. Semi-quantitative color-based colorimetric methods possessing simple and fast characteristics should be developed to determine the NH4         +–N concentration with the purpose of promoting reasonable use of biogas slurry in area of crop cultivation. Otherwise, excessive use of biogas slurry can adversely affect crops and increase environmental risks. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
