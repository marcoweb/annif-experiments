#ITI#Rotation of broad bean improves the soil quality of facility green house#FTI#
#IRE#The soil quality in facilities greenhouses is serious deteriorated. Broad bean (Vicia faba L.) can improve soil major composition by the symbiosis with abundant Rhizobium in their root systems. In order to identify whether broad beans can improve soil quality in facilities greenhouses, this study used the soil samples from ten facilities sheds planting before and after broad bean as a rotation crop. We monitored the change of critical indicators which can reflect the quality of soil, including soil physical, chemical property and enzyme activities. The results showed that planting broad beans reduced pH by 0.29~1.52 Unit and increased available nitrogen by 16.8%~278.6%, phosphorus by 30.6%~1071.1%, potassium by 29.3%~395.7% and organic carbon by 19.3%~29.2% in soil. Furthermore, salt content changed significantly by 37.5%~323.3%. In addition, planting broad beans enhanced protease, urease, sucrose and catalase activities in soil. The improvement of soil increased the rotation crop yields by 3.0%~25%. Our results suggest that rotation with broad beans improved the physical and chemical properties of soil, enhanced soil enzyme activities and increased the crop yields, which can play an important application in facilities sheds.
