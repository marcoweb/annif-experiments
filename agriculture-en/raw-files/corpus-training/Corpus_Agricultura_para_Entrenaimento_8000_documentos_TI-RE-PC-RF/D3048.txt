#ITI#Response of mungbean to NPK and lime under the conditions of vindhyan region of Uttar Pradesh#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted for the management of soil acidity with fertility and lime levels to sustain the productivity of acid soil in Vindhyyan region of Uttar Pradesh (India). Results of the study demonstrated that significant improvement in plant height (49.23 cm), number of nodule (76.95), dry weight of nodule (49.75 mg), highest LAI (4.45), yield parameters, yields, protein (21.39%), nutrient content and total NPK uptake (96.68 kg/ha) were recorded with 100% RDF. Similar results were observed for all growth and yield parameters such as protein (%), nutrient (%) and total NPK uptake by crop with application of 200 kg lime/ha. A significantly higher seed yield (6.22 q/ha) was recorded with 100 % RDF + 200 kg lime/ha as compared to other treatment combinations, which was at par with 100 % RDF + 300 kg lime/ha and 125 % RDF + 300 kg lime/ha.
