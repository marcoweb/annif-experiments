#ITI#Evaluation of Insecticides and Biopesticides against Helicoverpa armigera in Different Modules of Short Duration Pigeonpea#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] is an important legume crop from the Family Fabaceae. Pigeonpea commonly known as ‘Arhar’ or ‘Tim’ is mainly consumed in the form of split pulse as ‘dal’. Pigeonpea is cultivated as an annual or semi-perennial crop, usually in mixed cropping systems. Pigeonpea is attacked by insect-pests right from sowing to harvesting and also during the storage. Gram pod borer, H. armigera has been a major pest in most parts of the country. Therefore, keeping these views in mind, the present study was conducted. Methods: Present investigations were carried out during Kharif season of 2013 and 2014 to evaluate some insecticides and biopesticides against Helicoverpa armigera in various modules on short duration pigeonpea. Result: The mean larval population of H. armigera after spray was minimum in M3 (1.15 larvae plant-1) followed by M2 (1.17 larvae plant-1) and maximum in module M5 (1.61 larvae plant-1) during Khaif 2013. During Khaif 2014 mean larval population of H. armigera after spray was minimum in M2 (1.11 larvae plant-1) followed by M3 (1.12 larvae plant-1) and maximum in module M5 (1.58 larvae plant-1). Hence these modules (M2 and M3) can be adopted by the farmers for effective and economic management of H. armigera. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
