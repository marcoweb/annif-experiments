#ITI#Experimental infection with avian leukosis virus isolated from Marek's disease vaccines#FTI#
#IRE#Recently, avian leukosis virus (ALV) was isolated from four lots of Marek's disease vaccine produced by two laboratories. The ALVs isolated were characterized by examination of their interactions with cells of two phenotypes (C/E and C/A,E), subgroup-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus neutralization, envelope gene sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. All four ALVs are exogenous, belong to subgroup A, and appear to be virtually identical to each other based on PCR and envelope gene nucleotide sequences. We describe herein the characterization of the contaminant viruses in vivo by means of experimental infection in chickens. The contaminant viruses established transient viremia in specified pathogen-free (SPF) Leghorn chickens and elicited a robust and lasting antibody response detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. None of the contaminant ALVs induced tumors up to 31 wk of age, and mortality was insignificant. Despite a strong antibody response against the contaminant ALVs, vertical (congenital) transmission to the progeny of experimentally infected SPF chickens took place, albeit at a very low rate (â‰¤1.6%). Experimental infection in meat-type chicken embryos resulted in viremia at hatch, suggesting that some meat-type chickens are susceptible to infection and support virus replication.#FRE#
