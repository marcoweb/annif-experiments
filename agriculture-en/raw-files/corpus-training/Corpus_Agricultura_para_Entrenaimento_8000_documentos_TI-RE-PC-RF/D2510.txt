#ITI#Evaluation of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan l.) genotypes for nutritional quality#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was conducted for evaluation of proximate composition of 25 pigeon pea genotypes (Cajanus cajan L.) differing in colour. The analysis revealed significant differences in the content of moisture (7.04-12.09%); crude protein (17.62-25.45%); crude fat (1.41-2.93%); carbohydrate, (49.68-60.48) and ash (3.05-5.00%). Limiting amino acids viz tryptophan and methionine were ranged from 0.56-1.03 and 0.70-1.16 g/16g N respectively. The genotype PT-012-16 was found to be high in protein (25.45%), whereas the genotype PT-04-391 recorded the highest fat (2.93%). The higher tryptophan was observed in genotype PT-012-26 (1.03 g/16g N) whereas highest methionine content was recorded in PT012-6 (1.16 g/16g N). All genotypes under study were found to be deficient in both the limiting amino acids tryptophan and methionine when compared with the WHO/FAO reference standard. This study revealed that the genotypes PT-012-9, PT-012-16 and PT-012-23 were found to be promising for future breeding programme for nutritional quality improvement. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
