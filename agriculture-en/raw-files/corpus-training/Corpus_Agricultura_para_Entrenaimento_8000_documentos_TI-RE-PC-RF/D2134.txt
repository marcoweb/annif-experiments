#ITI#Use of the partial nutrient budget as an indicator of nutrient depletion in the highlands of southwestern Uganda#FTI#
#IRE#Agricultural management has its roots in the manipulation of the system to optimise conditions for crop production. It is now widely recognised that this could result in land degradation with subsequent serious impact on crop productivity if the nutrient losses to the agricultural system are not replaced. A nutrient budget is an account of gains and losses of nutrients in an agricultural system, a tool that could be used to develop sound nutrient management and sustainable agriculture. This tool was applied to the annual crop farming system in the highlands of southwestern Uganda to demonstrate (i) within farm nutrient depletion and accumulating zones, and (ii) the extent of nutrient losses at farm and district levels through marketing pathways. Partial nutrient budgets were constructed at field and farm levels using farmer-recorded resource inputs and outputs over a period of one year, and at the district level using annual inventory data of agricultural imports and exports. The computed nutrient balances were highly variable at field and farm levels, but predominantly negative. Nitrogen (N) gains and losses averaged 30.6 and 72.3 kg ha-1 yr-1, respectively in the homestead fields; 10.8 and 33.4 kg ha-1yr-1 in the outfields; 15.8 and 17.4 kg ha-1 yr-1 at the farm level; and only losses of 5.6 kg ha-1 yr-1 at the district level. Potassium (K) gains and losses followed a similar trend, although less in magnitude. The phosphorus (P) balance was positive but only in the homestead fields and at the farm level. Where agricultural produce were marketed, nutrient losses were reflected more at the higher scales (e.g. district level) and became tied up in pools from which recycling back to agriculture was barely feasible, and with quite alarming monetary implications. Such results can be used to influence policies at different scales on nutrient management.#FRE#
