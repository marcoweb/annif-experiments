#ITI#Combining Tithonia diversifolia and minjingu phosphate rock for improvement of P availability and maize grain yields on a chromic acrisol in Morogoro, Tanzania#FTI#
#IRE#A 2-year field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of Tithonia diversifolia green manure combined with either Minjingu phosphate rock (MPR) or triple super phosphate (TSP) on soil chemical properties that influence P availability, P pools and maize grain yields, on a Chromic Acrisol in Morogoro, Tanzania. Leafy biomass of tithonia was applied before maize planting for two consecutive growing seasons. Treatments compared were the control, MPR and TSP each at 80 kg P ha-1; tithonia alone at 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 Mg ha -1 dry matter and tithonia combined with MPR or TSP at 40 kg P ha-1. Tithonia led to significant increases in soil pH, exchangeable Ca, labile (resin and NaHCO3-Pi), and moderately labile inorganic P (NaOH-Pi). It reduced exchangeable Al and P sorption. Application of MPR alone had liming effects and resulted in increase in labile P. Combining tithonia with MPR had similar but more intense effects. Triple superphosphate alone led to acidification and this was reversed when TSP was co-applied with tithonia. Increasing the application rates of tithonia either alone or in combination with TSP or MPR led to more pronounced liming effects but the differences between 2.5 and 5.0 Mg tithonia ha-1 were not significant due to moisture stress that was experienced during the season. The P and Ca concentrations of the maize plants at tasselling increased with the application of tithonia alone or combined with MPR or TSP, and were significantly correlated with maize grain yields (r = 0.75 and 0.64 for MPR and TSP, respectively). Tithonia added consecutively for 2 years increased total maize grain yields by 70% compared to that in the control. The relative agronomic effectiveness (RAE) of MPR increased from 46% in the first year of application to > 142% in the second year, indicating that the initially slow dissolution of MPR improved by combined application of tithonia and MPR, attributed to reduction of P sorption. It is concluded that tithonia can enhance P availability from the Chromic Acrisol through modification of soil properties associated with P transformation and availability. In cases where tithonia is found within the farmers' fields its combined application with MPR can increase maize yields at a much-reduced cost associated with tithonia procurement.
