#ITI#Pollinator-mediated competition influences selection for flower-color displacement in sympatric monkeyflowers#FTI#
#IRE#• Premise of study: When coflowering plant species share pollinators, pollinator-mediated competition may favor divergent floral characters associated with pollinator attraction. One potential outcome of this process is that sympatric populations will display increased divergence in floral traits compared with allopatric populations. We developed a new system to study the pattern and process of character displacement. In the central Sierra Nevada of California, USA, Mimulus bicolor is a spring wildflower with two flower-color morphs, one of which resembles coflowering M. guttatus.#FRE#
