#ITI#Predicting crop residue decomposition using moisture adjusted time scales#FTI#
#IRE#Crop residue decomposition is generally described by exponential decay functions with empirically determined decay constants. The most common time scales used are days after application (DAA), degree-days (DD) and decomposition-days (DCD). We propose a new time scale (corrected degree-days, CDD) that reflects the effect of moisture on decomposition by dividing the daily mean temperature by the difference between maximum and minimum temperature. The objectives of this study were to compare the ability of using different time scales to predict biomass decomposition, and to account for the effect of weather conditions on biomass decomposition. Results from a 4-month litterbag study in which crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and oats (Avena sativa L.) were allowed to decompose on the soil surface were used to validate the models under field conditions. The first-order exponential model using either DAA, DD, DCD or CDD as time scales was able to properly estimate biomass decomposition. However, only when time was calculated using DCD and CDD methodologies was the model able to account for the effect of weather conditions on residue decomposition. The concept of CDD has several advantages that may justify the use of this time scale in field decomposition studies: the calculation is simple, is exclusively based on climatic conditions, and allows to reflect possible temperature and moisture interactions in decomposition.
