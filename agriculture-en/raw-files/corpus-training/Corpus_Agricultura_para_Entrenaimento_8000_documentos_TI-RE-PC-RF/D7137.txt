#ITI#Peach orchard evapotranspiration in a sandy soil: Comparison between eddy covariance measurements and estimates by the FAO 56 approach#FTI#
#IRE#The evapotranspiration from a 3 to 4 years old drip irrigated peach orchard, located in central Portugal, was measured using the eddy covariance technique during two irrigation seasons, allowing the determination of crop coefficients. These crop coefficient values differed from those tabled in FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56. In order to improve evapotranspiration estimates obtained from FAO tabled crop coefficients, a dual crop coefficient methodology was adopted, following the same guidelines. This approach includes a separation between the plant and soil components of the crop coefficient as well as an adjustment for the sparse nature of the vegetation. Soil evaporation was measured with microlysimeters and compared with soil evaporation estimates obtained by the FAO 56 approach. The FAO 56 method, using the dual crop coefficient methodology, was also found to overestimate crop evapotranspiration. During 2 consecutive years, measured and estimated crop coefficients were around 0.5 and 0.7, respectively. The estimated and measured soil evaporation components of the crop coefficient were similar. Therefore, the overestimation in evapotranspiration seems to result from an incorrect estimate of the plant transpiration component of the crop coefficient. A modified parameter to estimate plant transpiration for young, yet attaining full production, drip irrigated orchards is proposed based on field measurements. The method decreases the value of basal crop coefficient for fully developed vegetation. As a result, estimates of evapotranspiration were greatly improved. Therefore, the new approach seems adequate to estimate basal crop coefficients for orchards attaining maturity established on sandy soils and possibly for other sparse crops under drip irrigation conditions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
