#ITI#Multivariate analysis and its application for characterizing cowpea landraces#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Several major crops have been genetically eroded due to introduction of new material but cowpea have great potential and wide genetic base of novel significance. A new strategy of cowpea evaluation was adopted to investigate the potential of 71 landraces representing 31 districts of Pakistan through multivariate analysis to devise future plan for germplasm conservation. Methods: Cowpea 71 landraces collected from 31 districts were planted under field conditions in an augmented design. Plant descriptors qualitative traits (plant color, leaf shape, plant type, twining tendency, anthocynin pigment and fodder types) and agronomic traits (plant height, branches, pods, grain yield, biomass and harvest index) were recorded. Protein banding pattern was established. Similarity index, variance were calculated and phylogenetic trees were constructed by software “Statistica”. Result: Four cowpea landraces showed tremendous performance to phenotypic as well as protein banding pattern variation viz., Pk-27154 (Jhang), Pk-27047 (Vehari), Pk-27029 (Sialkot) and Pk-27107 (Bahawalpur). High inter and intra variation suggested further genotype x environmental interaction trials at multi-locations. Sampling from the neglected areas especially Sindh and Baluchistan parts are hereby recommended to gather unique landraces and accessions before the genetic resources might be depleted through various environmental stresses. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
