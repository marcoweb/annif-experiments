#ITI#Productivity of white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) as an effect of diversified farming systems#FTI#
#IRE#A one-factor field experiment with white lupin cv. Butan was conducted in the years 2011-2015 in Gorzyñ (52°33'53 N, 15°53'42 E; Poland). The factor consisted of farming systems: low-input (LI), medium-input (MI) and high-input (conventional-CONV). The lowest weed density and biomass were found in CONV and the highest in LI. The weather conditions significantly influenced yielding. Each year the highest yield was found in CONV and significantly lowest in LI. On an average, the highest increase in the seed yield was obtained following increasing intensity of cultivation from LI to MI (20.3%). Farming systems did not influence the chemical composition of seeds. The highest protein yield was found in CONV (804 kg ha-1) and significantly lower - by about 6% in MI and about 19% in LI. The highest income and the lowest cost of production for 1 t of seeds and protein were recorded for LI. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
