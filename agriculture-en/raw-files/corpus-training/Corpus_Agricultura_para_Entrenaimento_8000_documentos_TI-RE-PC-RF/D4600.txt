#ITI#Surveillance and control of avian influenza in the New York live bird markets#FTI#
#IRE#A comprehensive avian influenza control program was established for the New York live bird market (LBM) system. Its purpose was to eliminate avian influenza virus (AIV) from the marketing system. The application of science-based surveillance, improved diagnostic performance, voluntary efforts of the LBM owners, and regulatory enforcement have resulted in the elimination of an H7 low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) that had persisted in the LBM system for 13 yr. Although sporadic introductions of H5N2 LPAIVs have occurred, successful control measures have not allowed this virus to become established within the system.
