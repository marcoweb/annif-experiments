#ITI#Screening and Biochemical Analysis on Blackgram Genotypes for Resistance against Storage Pest Bruchine [Callosobruchus maculatus (F.)]#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Blackgram [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper] is a rich source of protein. It is one of the major crops essentially involved in daily human diets. However, storage pest bruchine [Callosobruchus maculatus (F.)] is a major production constraint for legumes. A research was formulated to assess the bruchine resistance in 20 blackgram genotypes along with the biochemical analysis to find out the active biochemical components responsible for the resistance activity. Methods: The experiment was carried out during August-October, 2019 at Entomology Laboratory, National Pulses Research Center, Vamban, India. The experimental material comprised of 20 blackgram genotypes which were screened for bruchine resistance. Further, confirmatory trial was conducted with selected resistant entries and highly susceptible entries during October-December, 2019. Both experiments were carried out in completely randomized design and replicated three times. GC-MS analysis on the resistant and susceptible entries were performed to ascertain the active biochemical components conferring resistance. Result: Among the genotypes, TU 68 had comparatively late developmental time (days), less number of adult emergence, higher mean developmental period (days), less susceptibility index, less seed damage (%) and less seed weight loss (%). Genotype TU 68 was found to be resistant in the confirmatory trial also. Less number of adult emergence and higher mean developmental period indicated the delayed developmental period which is a mechanism of bruchine resistance. GC-MS analysis on resistant (TU 68) and susceptible (MDU 1) genotypes indicated the presence of active biochemical compounds with insectifuge activity in TU 68. Hence, TU 68 could be utilized in the hybridization programmeas donor for bruchine resistance. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
