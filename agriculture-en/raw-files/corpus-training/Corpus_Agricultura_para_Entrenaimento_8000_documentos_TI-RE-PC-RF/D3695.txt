#ITI#Detection of RNA1 and RNA2 of Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus in winter wheat grown from infected seeds#FTI#
#IRE#A Polish isolate of Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV-Pol1) was characterized by limited pathogenicity and a low concentration of virus particles in infected plant tissues. The aim of this research was to consider the possibility of seed-transmission dissemination of the virus. Seeds of winter wheat cv. Muszelka served as material for the studies. Two methods were involved in the diagnostics of seedlings grown from potentially infected seeds: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as the screening assay and immuno-capture-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (IC-RT-PCR) for molecular confirmation of the infection. RNA1 and RNA2 of SBWMV-Pol1 were detected in 6 out of 1,410 plants submitted to diagnostic procedures. The possibility of seed transmission of SBWMV-Pol1 was discussed. © by Małgorzata Jelewska 2016.#FRE#
