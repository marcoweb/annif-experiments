#IRE#The present study was aimed at optimizing operational and crop parameters influencing the mechanized harvesting and threshing of mung-bean crop with combine harvester. Two varieties of summer mung-bean SML-668 and SML-832 and one variety of kharif mung-bean ML-818 were selected for the study. Concave clearance was kept as 25 mm at front side and 10 mm from rear side. The height of cut the crop ranged from 8-9.5 cm. Threshing efficiency was more than 98% at cylinder peripheral speeds C3 and C4 in all varieties except SML-832. The percent grain damage was higher for higher cylinder peripheral speed and lower for higher forward speed. The grain damage ranged from 1.54 – 3.22 percent for C1, C2 and C3 cylinder peripheral speed in all crop varieties. Peripheral speed of 18.91 m/s and forward speed of 1.5 km/h was found to be optimum for harvesting mung-bean with combine harvester for all crop varieties. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
