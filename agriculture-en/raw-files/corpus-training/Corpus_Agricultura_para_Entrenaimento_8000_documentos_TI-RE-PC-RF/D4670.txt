#ITI#Hemagglutinating activity of gallibacterium strains#FTI#
#IRE#In the present study, the hemagglutinating activity of seven reference strains, and nine Mexican and three Danish field isolates, of Gallibacterium was investigated by using fresh erythrocytes of 19 different types including chicken (broiler, rooster, layer hen), turkey, pigeon, quail, duck, Harris's hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), cow, sheep, horse, dog, rabbit, pig, and human (groups A, B, AB, and O; Rh+). Agglutination was observed for broiler chicken, layer hen, quail, rabbit, and pig erythrocytes with a subset of Gallibacterium strains, whereas most tested strains agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes. Transmission electron microscopic examination of a hemagglutinating strain demonstrated a close interaction between the bacterial and erythrocyte surfaces. The results indicate that some Gallibacterium strains are able to agglutinate avian or mammalian erythrocytes, or both. However, the mechanisms enabling hemagglutination are not known and will be addressed in future studies.#FRE#
