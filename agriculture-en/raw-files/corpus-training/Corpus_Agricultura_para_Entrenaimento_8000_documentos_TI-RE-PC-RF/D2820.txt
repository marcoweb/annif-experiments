#ITI#Enhancing the Water Stress Tolerance in Soybean (Glycine max L.) through Anti-Transpirants and Mulch#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during kharif 2014-2015 in the Agricultural Research Station, Adilabad, Telangana to assess the effect of straw mulch and anti-transpirants on growth and yield of soybean. The treatment consisted of A) Anti-transpirants (5) (spray at 15 days after flower initiation): T1-MgCO3 @ 5%; T2 Glycerol @ 5%; T3-KNO3 @ 1%; T4-NaCO3 @ 5%; T5-Control (water spray) B). Straw mulch @ 5 t/ha after sowing C) Control (no mulch). Among the different anti-transpirants, Na2 CO3 @ 5% recorded higher mean seed yield (2862 kg/ha) which was at par with Glycerol @ 5% (2762 kg/ha) and MgCO3 @ 5% (2731 kg/ha). Mulch (straw mulch @ 5 t/ha) was significantly superior over control (without mulch) with highest mean seed yield (2723 kg/ha). The combination of straw mulch and anti-transpirant can be recommended as an effective with respect to yield and cost for the soybean under rainfed condition.
