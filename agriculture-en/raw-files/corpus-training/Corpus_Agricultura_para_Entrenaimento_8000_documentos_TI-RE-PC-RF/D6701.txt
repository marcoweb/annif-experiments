#ITI#Farm drainage channel network optimization by improved modified minimal spanning tree#FTI#
#IRE#Collection, conveyance and discharge of farm drainage water using open channel network is an important task in an agricultural area. Design of an open channel network is based on the total length and conveying capacity of the channel, topography of the area and specific local conditions. Therefore, designing proper channel paths is an effective factor in the optimum network design. In this study, three optimization models have been considered: the modified minimal spanning tree, the shortest path and the out-of-kilter algorithms. The modified minimal spanning tree model for optimization of a farm drainage channel network (FDCN) has been improved to a better algorithm. The algorithm has been applied to optimize a part of the Sansad irrigation network project. Then, the FDCN system of the Jiroft and Roodbar plain was mathematically modeled considering regional constraints and optimized using the presented models. Results showed that the improved modified minimal spanning tree model, gives the shortest channel network length compared to the other three models. Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
