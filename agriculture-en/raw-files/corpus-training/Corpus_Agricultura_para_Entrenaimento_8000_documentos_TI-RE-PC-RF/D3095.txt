#ITI#Variability, character association and path coefficient analysis of green pod yield and its related traits in pea (Pisum sativum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Genetic variability, character association and path coefficient studies were carried out for yield and yield contributing characters for twenty-four diverse genotype of pea. The results revealed a wide range of phenotypic variation, along with high heritability in pea. Highest pod yield per plant was recorded in VRP-229 followed by VRP-372 and VRP-305. The characters namely, plant height and weight of seeds per pod showed high magnitude, while number of pods per plant, number of branches per plant and pod yield per plant showed moderate magnitude for phenotypic and genotypic coefficient of variation. The heritability and genetic advance were high for days to first pod initiation, plant height and pod yield per plant indicating its additive gene action for their expression. Character association studies revealed that pod yield per plant exhibit positive and highly significant correlation with number of pods per plant, number of branches per plant and days to fifty percent flowering. The path coefficient studies also revealed that maximum positive direct effect was observed through number of pods per plant followed by days to first flowering, single pod weight and pod length towards yield indicated that these characters may be considered as the most reliable selection indices while making selection for high yielding genotypes.
