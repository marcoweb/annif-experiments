#ITI#Adenovirus group II-like infection in chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar)#FTI#
#IRE#Seven live 5-to-6-wk-old chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar) were examined because of increased lacrimation, swollen eyelids, and increased mortality. Gross lesions consisted of mildly enlarged and mottled white spleens, swollen eyelids with external scab formation, and watery intestinal contents. Microscopically, there were increased numbers of mononuclear phagocytic system cells in the spleen, some of which contained faintly staining basophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, blepharoconjunctivitis, enteritis associated with coccidia and crop mycosis. Transmission electron microscopy of the spleen revealed icosahedral virus particles 65 to 75 nm in diameter, consistent with the morphology of adenovirus. Three out of seven chukars were positive for hemorrhagic enteritis virus by serology.#FRE#
