#ITI#Economic analysis of water harvesting in a mountainous watershed in India#FTI#
#IRE#Water management is an essential feature of any project related with overall development of agriculture. The Soan river catchment in the northwest Himalayas, is fed only by rainwater. Hence, a strategy of rainfed agriculture needs to be developed through water conservation and storage techniques. The Soan is an important river from a soil erosion and water management point of view and detailed economic analysis is needed for any proposal to be implemented in the field. The present study was undertaken to propose an economic analysis of water harvesting structures for the Soan catchment. The purpose of the investigation is to control erosion and conserve water to meet the requirements of supplemental and pre-sowing irrigation for major cereal crops in the area and to maximise agricultural productivity. Benefit/cost ratios ranging from 0.41 to 1.33 are obtained for water harvesting structures of different sizes with estimated life of 25 and 40 years respectively, by taking into account different crop return from maize and wheat.
