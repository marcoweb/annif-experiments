#ITI#Maximization of mutation frequency in grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Frequency of mutations (Chlorophyll, foliar and agronomic) have been reported following seed treatment of grasspea cv. Dhenkanal local with γ-rays, EMS, NG and their combinations at varying doses. NG was the most potent mutagen for induction of mutation followed by EMS and γ-rays. Combination treatments showed synergistic effect for mutation frequency. EMS and NG, singly or in combination with γ -rays, were more or less equipotent in inducing agronomic mutations, while, γ-ray was less effective.#FRE#
