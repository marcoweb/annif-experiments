#ITI#Agro-morphlogical and Quality Characters in two Summer Legume Crops: Mung Bean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] and Guar [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub] Genotypes Grown in Mediterranean Climate Conditions#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The aim of the present study was to investigate the grain yield, some yield components and quality parameters of mung bean and guar genotypes as summer legumes in East of Mediterranean region of Turkey. Methods: The field experiments were organized in randomized complete blocks design (RCBD) with three replications throughout 2016 and 2018. Result: The greatest the grain yield of mung bean was achieved by genotype KPS1 (3141kg ha-1) and lowest one was obtained from VC6153B6 (2344 kg ha-1) in the average of years. According to the mean years, maximum grain yield of guar was produced by genotype 45 (2354 kg ha-1), while the lowest grain yield was obtained from genotype 37 (1561 kg ha-1). Ash, crude protein, ADF and NDF contents in mung bean genotypes varied beetwen 2.8 and 3.0%, 21.9 and 25.3%, 30.8 and 34.6% and 41.3 and 49.7% in the average of years, respectively. Guar genotypes contain 90.3 to 90.7 drymatter, 4.8 to 5.0% crude ash, 3.8 to 4.6% crude fat and 33.2 to 35.4% crude protein. Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
