#ITI#Correlation analysis of Alfalfa varieties based on production performances, winter survival rates and fall dormancies#FTI#
#IRE#Selection for fall dormancy (FD) in alfalfa can impact other traits, such as dry matter yield (DMY), winter survival rate (WSR) and chemical compositions. Nine alfalfa varieties were mowed during the early flowering stage from 2015 to 2018. The results showed that the WSRs of both Zhongmu No. 2 and Caoyuan No. 3 exceeded 95% and there was a significant negative correlation between the FD rating and WSR (-0.988; P<0.01). The four-year average DMY of Zhongmu No. 2 was the highest (11,912 kg ha-1). The crude protein contents of Caoyuan No. 3 and Zhongmu No. 2 were both greater than 20%. Zhongmu No. 2 had the lowest acid detergent fiber (30.2%) and neutral detergent fiber (48.4%) contents as well as the highest relative feed values (126). Zhongmu No. 2, Adrenalin, Gold Empress and Caoyuan No. 3 (FD 1-4) were the optimum alfalfa varieties for planting in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
