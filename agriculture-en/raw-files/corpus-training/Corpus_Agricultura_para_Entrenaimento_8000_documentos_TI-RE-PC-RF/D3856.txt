#ITI#Prevalence and phylogenetic analysis of Fig mosaic virus and Fig badnavirus-1 in Iran#FTI#
#IRE#Fig mosaic virus (FMV) and Fig badnavirus-1 (FBV-1) are two of the most important fig infecting viruses. The incidence and distribution of FBV-1 and FMV were determined by testing in PCR 138 asymptomatic and symptomatic samples. These samples were collected from 60 fig gardens and agricultural fields in three provinces of Iran. The fig infecting viruses FBV-1 and FMV, respectively, were detected in 92 (66.6%) and 34 (24.6%) samples collected from all the surveyed fields. Overall, 24 out of 138 (17.3%) samples showed mixed infections. The sequence analysis of a genomic fragment of 922 nt, comprising the entire ORF-2 and part of the 5' termini of the ORF-3 of 10 selected FBV-1 Iranian isolates from different provinces, and of the type member from GenBank (Acc. No: JF411989), showed a variation ranging from 1 to 3% at nucleotide level and 1% at the amino acid level. The phylogenetic analysis grouped the FBV-1 isolates into two groups, with the Iranian isolates clustered in two distinct subgroups of group I, according to their geographical origin. In our research, the prevalence and sequence analysis of FBV-1 as the only identified DNA virus infecting fig trees, was studied for the first time in Iran.#FRE#
