#ITI#Local adaptation mediates floral responses to water limitation in an annual wildflower#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Understanding how environmental stress affects the strength of mutualisms is critically important given observed and projected environmental changes. In particular, the frequency and duration of drought have been increasing worldwide. We investigated how water availability affects plant traits that mediate a pollination mutualism. Methods: For butterfly-pollinated Phlox drummondii, we determined how moisture availability affects flower size, nectar volume, and nectar sugar amount. Furthermore, we explored the role that local adaptation may play in responses to moisture availability by including plants collected from regions that differ in aridity. Finally, we determined whether responses of plant populations to selection may differ under drought by calculating heritability of traits under control and dry conditions. Results: Flower size was generally smaller in dry plants than in control plants. Early in the treatment period, nectar volume and sugar were higher in dry plants than in control plants for plants from both arid and wetter regions. With prolonged dry treatment, nectar volume and sugar remained higher only in plants from the arid region. Heritability of floral traits was lower for water-limited plants than for control plants. Conclusions: Plant investment into pollination mutualisms under environmental stress may depend on the extent to which populations are already locally adapted to such conditions, suggesting that mutualism may remain strong, at least in arid regions. However, decreases in heritability under water-limitation suggest that responses to selection imposed by pollinators may be low, even if drought-adapted plants maintain production of rewards to pollinators. © 2020 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
