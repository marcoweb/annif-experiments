#ITI#Control of coccidiosis in turkeys with diclazuril and monensin: Effects upon performance and development of immunity to Eimeria species#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of diclazuril and monensin, when included in the feed of turkeys from 0 to 10 wk, upon performance and development of immunity to Eimeria species was investigated. Birds were initially inoculated with a low dose of oocysts of three species of Eimeria at 3, 5, 7, and 9 days of age in order to simulate a natural infection. Weight gain and feed intake from 0 to 6 wk of age was significantly greater in medicated birds compared with those that received no anticoccidial medication. Weight gain and feed intake from 6 to 10 wk was greater in birds that received diclazuril than in unmedicated birds. No differences in performance were evident after drug withdrawal from 10 to 16 wk. Immunity to Eimeria species developed by 10 wk in birds that received no anticoccidial medication but did not develop in those given diclazuril or monensin.#FRE#
