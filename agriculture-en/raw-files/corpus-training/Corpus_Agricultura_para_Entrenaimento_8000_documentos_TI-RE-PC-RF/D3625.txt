#ITI#Practical and economic efficacy of ambrosia artemisiifolia L. surveillance in compliance with the international standards#FTI#
#IRE#Ambrosia artemisiifolia distribution in the Ukraine for the 1973-2013 period was analyzed. The infested areas were consequently grouped into 6 categories. Intense infestation in the region was the reason for the analysis and the categorization. A practical approach to the A. artemisiifolia surveillance system which complied with the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures concerning "a pest free area", "pest free places of production", "pest free production sites" and "an area of low pest prevalence" was recommended. This action should drive the policy-making process to underpin national legislation regarding invasive species. The opportunity also presents itself for improved communications with growers and stakeholders because of the more transparent and cost effective system of A. artemisiifolia surveillance offered. There would be a chance to slow down the A. artemisiifolia invasion even though this invasive species has already occupied 3.6 million hectares.#FRE#
