#ITI#Response of sowing dates and bio regulators on yield of clusterbean under current climate in alley cropping system in eastern U.P., India#FTI#
#IRE#The impacts on yields of cluster bean were assessed for normal (15 July) and late (30 July) sowing environments and foliar spray of thiourea (500, 1000 ppm) and salicylic acid (50, 100 ppm) at 45 and 60 days after sowing (DAS).Significantly higher yield parameters, yield, economics, protein content and nutrient uptake were recorded with foliar spray of thiourea at 500 ppm as compared to all other bio regulator sprays. Similarly, spray of salicylic acid at 100 ppm enhanced yield and other growth parameters which were statistically at par with those for thiourea 500 ppm foliar spray at 45 and 60 DAS. The data show that the foliar application of bio regulators at normal sowing date enhances seed yield of clusterbean by improving the physiological processes. The interaction effects were significant between the sowing date and bio-regulators on the seed yield. The highest seed yield of 993 and 845 kg/ha was obtained with foliar spray of thiourea at 500 ppm in normal and late sowing, respectively, while the lowest yield of 775 and 769 kg/ha was obtained for the water spray control in normal and late sowing, respectively.
