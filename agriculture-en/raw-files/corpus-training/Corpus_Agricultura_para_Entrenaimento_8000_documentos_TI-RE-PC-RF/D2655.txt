#ITI#Genetic variability, character association and genetic divergence in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea l.) accessions#FTI#
#IRE#Present investigation was conducted in 31 groundnut accessions to assess genetic divergence, characters association involving 13 quantitative characters and path coefficients in order to identify superior accessions exhibiting higher genetic diversity. Number of pods/plant, secondary branches, kernel width and pod yield displayed a higher level of coefficient of variation both at phenotypic and genotypic level. Genetic advance with higher heritability indicated preponderance of additive variance for pod length, pod yield and number of pods/plant. Number of secondary branches, kernel width, pod length and number of pods/plant revealed significant positive correlation with pod yield. Path coefficient analysis revealed exertion of high positive direct effects on pod yield through pod length, kernel width and number of pods/plant. Cluster analysis exhibited substantial diversity among 31 accessions forming 13 clusters. Two clusters [X (two accessions) and XII (one accession)] showed the largest distance, which suggests hybridization between these accessions to achieve high level of heterosis for further exploitation. Five accessions viz., TAG-24, TG-69, ICGV-02005, TG-73 and TG-80 were identified as the most divergent for future use. Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
