#ITI#Bio-efficacy of different insecticides against spotted pod borer, maruca testulalis (Geyer) infesting cowpea#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the relative efficacy of nine chemical insecticides against spotted pod borer, [Maruca testulalis (Geyer)] infesting cowpea during Kharif season of 2009. The results revealed that endosulfan 0.07 per cent caused highest mortality (89 to 87%) of M. testulalis. But the effectiveness of the eco-friendly insecticides like NSKE 5 per cent (85 to 83% mortality) and azadirachtin 0.001 per cent (84 to 82 per cent mortality) were statistically at par with that of endosulfan 0.07 per cent. Thus, two sprays of endosulfan (0.07%) or neem seed kernel extract (5%) or azadirachtin (0.001%), first at the time of 50 percent flowering and second at 15 days after first spray can be recommended to the farmers for controlling this pest on cowpea during the Kharif season which were equally effective (85 to 82% mortality) against M. testulalis infesting cowpea.#FRE#
