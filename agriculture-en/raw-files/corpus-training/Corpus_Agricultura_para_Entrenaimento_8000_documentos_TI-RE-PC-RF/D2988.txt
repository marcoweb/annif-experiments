#ITI#Influence of polymer coated KSL 441 (op) soybean seed on productivity under moisture stress conditions#FTI#
#IRE#The field experiment was carried out at Department of Seed Science and Technology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore to know the influence of polymer seed coatings on growth and productivity of soybean seed under various moisture stress conditions viz., stress at 50 % flowering stage, stress at pod formation stage and stress at both 50% flowering and pod formation stages along with normal irrigation. The experiment consisted of six seed treatments (untreated control, Genius coat 171, Genius coat 172, Arcus, Myconate and Quick roots) with three replications and was laid out in split plot design. Seeds coated with Quick roots were found to be significantly superior in growth and yield parameters viz., field emergence, plant height, took less days for first and 50 per cent flowering, less disease incidence, higher number of pods plant−1 and seed yield both under normal and moisture stress conditions. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
