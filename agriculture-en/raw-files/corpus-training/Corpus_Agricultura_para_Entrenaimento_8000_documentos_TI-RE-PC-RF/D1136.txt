#ITI#Multiple paths of plant host toxicity are associated with the fungal toxin cercosporin#FTI#
#IRE#The Cercospora species of fungi are responsible for leaf spot disease affecting many key economic crops. Most of these fungi secrete a toxic photodynamic molecule, cercosporin, that reacts with light and oxygen to produce reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) contributing to fungal virulence. We show similar cellular localization and aetiology of cercosporin in the non-host Arabidopsis and the host Nicotiana benthamiana. Cercosporin accumulates in cell membranes in an oxidized state and in plastids in a mixture of redox states in a manner that is dependent on ongoing photosynthetic processes. We observed that cercosporin rapidly compromised photosynthesis as measured by Fv/Fm, NPQ, and photosystem I (PSI) parameters. Stomatal guard cells in particular demonstrated rapid light-dependent membrane permeabilization that led to changes in leaf conductance. We showed that cercosporin-mediated 1O2 generation oxidized RNA to form 8-oxoguanosine (8-oxoG), leading to translational attenuation and induction of 1O2 signature gene transcripts. We also identified a subset of cercosporin-induced transcripts that were independent of the photodynamic effect. Our results point to the multimodal action of cercosporin that includes the inhibition of photosynthesis, the direct oxidation of nucleic acid residues and the elicitation of complex transcriptome responses. © 2023 The Authors.
