#ITI#Incidence of Collar Rot of Groundnut in Rajasthan and its Management#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important legume crop of tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world. This crop suffers from several diseases like early leaf spot, late leaf spot, rust, groundnut bud necrosis, peanut clump and collar rot etc. But collar rot caused by Aspergillus niger van Teighem is one of the most important seed and soil borne diseases causing huge economic (40-50 per cent) loss in India and abroad. Methods: A roving survey was conducted to assess the incidence of collar rot in eight major groundnut growing districts of western Rajasthan i.e. Bikaner, Jodhpur, Churu, Jalore, Jaipur, Sikar, Nagaur and Dausa during Kharif 2018. A field experiment was carried out for two consecutive years (2019 and 2020) to manage the disease through altering micro-climate under canopy with six levels of seed rates (80, 85, 90, 95, 100 and 105 kg/ha). Result: Our investigations cleared that this disease is prevalent in all the 200 fields surveyed in eight districts of Rajasthan with 22.99 per cent overall disease incidence which varied from 17.84 to 32.38 per cent with monetary losses. Maximum disease incidence was recorded in Jaipur (28.85%) district while it was lowest in Nagaur district (20.15%). Higher disease reduction (12.97%) with increased pod yield (27.65%) was observed with higher seed rate of 105 kg/ha as compared to standard recommended seed rate (80 kg/ha) as this pathogen is favoured by higher temperature and low soil moisture, dense canopy provides shade that increases humidity under the cropped area and lowers temperature. As a result of this, plant mortality can be compensated by increasing plant population through seed rate, as it modifies the microclimate and generate an environment which is less favourable for developing collar rot disease of groundnut. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
