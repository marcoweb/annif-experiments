#ITI#Fertilizer dynamics in different tillage and crop rotation systems in a Vertisol in Central Mexico#FTI#
#IRE#N-fertilization dynamics and agronomic practices on a Vertisol in central Mexico were evaluated under irrigated conditions: (1) wheat-maize rotation with conventional tillage (CT) and burning of residues (W-M/CT/B, regional control); (2) wheat-beans rotation with CT and incorporation of residues into the soil (W-P/CT/I); (3) wheat-maize rotation with CT and incorporation of residues into the soil (W-M/CT/I); (4) maize-beans rotation bi-annual with CT and incorporation of residues into the soil (M-P/CT/Bi); and (5) wheat-maize, no tillage (NT) and residues left on the soil surface as mulch (W-M/NT/S). 15N and acetylene inhibition techniques were used to estimate N fertilizer efficiency and losses (N2 + N2O). Treatments received 240, 60, and 300 kg N ha-1 for spring maize, beans and winter wheat, as ammonium sulphate enriched with 5.468% atoms 15N excess. In the spring summer cycle, the fertilizer N recovery ranged from 27% for W-M/NT/S to 68% for M-P/CT/Bi. From the total N-fertilizer applied, only 3 to 9% remained in soil after harvest (W-M/NT/S and W-M/CT/I being the respective extremes). Unaccounted N-fertilizer ranged between 27 and 69%, the highest losses corresponding to W-M/NT/S treatment. Fertilizer N recovery in wheat varied from 19 to 37% (W-M/NT/S-W-M/CT/B). N-fertilizer remaining in soil was 14 to 24% (W-M/NT/S - W-M/CT/I). N2 and N2O emissions were higher in the no tillage system. Emissions ranged from 3 to 28 kg N ha-1 for W-P/CT/I and W-M/NT/S, respectively. The best treatments were those in which residues were incorporated resulting in N immobilization in top soil (0-15 cm), small N gas losses, and higher soil organic matter, these treatments were W-P/CT/I, W-M/CT/I. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
