#ITI#Performance of pea under different irrigation systems#FTI#
#IRE#The field experiment was conducted at Precision Farming Development Centre, Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering, Bhopal on influence of different irrigation methods in three continuous years (2010-2013) on the performance pea crop. Conventional flood irrigation, micro sprinkler and drip irrigation systems were adopted as three treatments and with seven replications in each treatment in the study. Pea (Arkel variety) crop was sown at a spacing of 45 X 10 cm. During the period of experiment flood irrigation were applied on weekly basis and micro irrigation and drip irrigation systems were operated every third day to meet the crop water requirement. The total quantity of water applied in flood, drip irrigation and micro sprinkler systems were 387.5, 244.7 and 273.5 mm respectively. Maximum crop yield was observed under micro sprinkler system (98.60 q/ha) followed by drip and conventional irrigation system. Saving of water was found better under drip irrigation over micro sprinkler irrigation system. Â© 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
