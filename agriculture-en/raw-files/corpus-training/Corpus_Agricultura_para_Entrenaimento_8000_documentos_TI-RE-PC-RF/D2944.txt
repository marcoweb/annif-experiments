#ITI#Stability for Grain Yield using AMMI Bi Plot and Disease Reaction Studies in Pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.]#FTI#
#IRE#The genetic material for finding the genotype × environment (G × E) interaction comprised of 15 advanced genotypes, which were tested in five environments, during kharif-2018. In totalling to these genotypes used for stability, four more genotypes (total 19 genotypes) were used for studying the disease reaction to Fusarium wilt (FW) and sterility mosaic disease (SMD) in respective sick plots. The AMMI (Additive main effects and multiplicative interaction) analysis of variance for grain yield publicized highly significant (p<0.01) for environments, G × E interaction, PCA I and PCA II significant (p<0.05) for genotypes. First principal component axis (PCA 1) of the interaction captured 60% of the interaction sum of squares. In AMMI analysis AMMI 1 bi plot showed that the genotypes viz., GRG-152 (G1), GRG-811 (G15), KRG-244 (G9), AGL-1603-2 (G12) and TS-3R (G14) recorded higher average mean yield with high main (additive) effects coupled with positive IPCA 1 score. While the genotypes KRG-224 (G5) though showed highest yield, but recorded negative IPCA 1 score demonstrating its environment sensitivity. Environments, such as Bheemarayana gudi (E2), Hagari (E4) and Malnoor (E5) could be regarded as more stable site for high yielding pigeonpea genotypes than other locations for grain yield as indicated IPCA scores. The disease screening revealed that the genotype AGL-1603-2 (G12) was resistant to both FW, SMD attached with high yield as indicated by its per se performance and the genotype GPT-1 showed resistance to both FW, SMD. Two genotypes viz., GRG-152 (G1) and GRG-811 (G15) showed resistance to FW and moderate resistance to SMD and possess high yielding as indicated by their per se performance. Hence, these genotypes could be used unswervingly as a varieties or choice of parents for hybridization programme. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
