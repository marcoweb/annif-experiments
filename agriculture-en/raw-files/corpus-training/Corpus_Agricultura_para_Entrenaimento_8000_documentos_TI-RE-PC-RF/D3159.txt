#ITI#Soybean cultivation by farmers of Maharashtra: Identification and analysis of the problems#FTI#
#IRE#In Maharashtra, soybean is cultivated on an area of 3.8 M ha with production of 3.07 m ton with second rank in India. However, low productivity of the crop remains a major problem of soybean cultivation, necessitating the need to ascertain the problems faced by soybean growers. Therefore, a study was conducted in the 20 villages of five districts of western Maharashtra. A survey method using personal interview of 100 farmers and focused group discussion with villagers, were used for data collection during the year 2013-14. Study found that labour problems, irrigation facilities, weed management, marketing of produce, pest and disease management were the top five constraints faced by the farmers in soybean cultivation. Shortage of labour and higher wages during peak period (95%) was major labour related constraints faced by farmers. In irrigation, farmers reported lack of irrigation facilities (81%) as major constraints in soybean cultivation. Proper farm mechanization, water conservation measures, short duration drought resistant varieties of soybean, timely supply of institutional credits and training to farmers on improved cultivation practices are important suggested measures to overcome the constraints faced by these farmers, for sustainable and profitable soybean production. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
