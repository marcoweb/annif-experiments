#ITI#Effect of foliar copper application on grain yield, 2-acetyl-1-Pyrroline and copper content in fragrant rice#FTI#
#IRE#Literature reporting the effects of application of exogenous copper (Cu) on the grain yield, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2-AP) and Cu content of fragrant rice is scarce. Pot experiments were conducted in early and later season in 2020 with two fragrant rice cultivars, Meixiangzhan and Yuxiangyouzhan, at heading stage using four treatments, i.e.: 0 (CK), 20 (T1), 40 (T2), and 60 mM (T3) CuSO4·5H2O to assess the effects of foliar copper application on the yield, 2-AP and Cu content. Results showed that T2 treatment improved the yield of Meixiangzhan and Yuxiangyouzhan by 6.88% and 11.35% respectively, by increased seed-setting rate. Meanwhile, T2 treatment greatly increased the grains 2-AP content by 21.95% and 10.15% in early season, and by 5.40% and 27.25% in later season, respectively, which was significant associated with the contents of proline, pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) and pyrroline, and the activities of proline dehydrogenase (PDH), ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) and pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid synthetase (P5CS). Foliar copper application increased the grain Cu content and showed the highest values in T3 treatment. Overall, foliar copper application at heading stage had a positive effect on yield and grain 2-AP and Cu content of fragrant rice. The results from this study show that T2 treatment (moderate CuSO4 application) had the most desirable outcomes, synergistically improving the yield and aroma of fragrant rice as well as enriching the grain copper content. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
