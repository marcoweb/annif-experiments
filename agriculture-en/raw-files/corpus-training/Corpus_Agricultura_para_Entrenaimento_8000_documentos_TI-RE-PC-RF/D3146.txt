#ITI#Effect of organics on seed yield and quality of green gram (Vigna radiata L.)#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted on clay textured soil during Kharif season of 2013 to study the effect of soil amendments and organic foliar sprays on crop growth, seed yield and quality of green gram (Vigna radiata L.). The soil application of organic manures and liquid organic foliar sprays at flower initiation and 15 days after flowering (DAF) significantly enhanced the seed yield and seed quality parameters of green gram. Application of FYM (1/3)+ Vermicompost (1/3) + glyricidia leaf manure (1/3) equivalent to 100% RDP and foliar spray of panchagavya (3%) at flower initiation and 15 DAF recorded significantly more number of pods per plant (21.27), pod length (10.25 cm), number of seeds per pod (12.10), seed yield (12.89 g/plant) and seed yield (1263.68 kg/ha) with concomitant higher seed quality parameters like 100 seed weight (5.86 g), seed germination percentage (95.67 %), shoot length(16.53cm) root length (18.25 cm), seedling vigour index (3308) and protein content (23.79 %) as compared to other treatment combinations and control.
