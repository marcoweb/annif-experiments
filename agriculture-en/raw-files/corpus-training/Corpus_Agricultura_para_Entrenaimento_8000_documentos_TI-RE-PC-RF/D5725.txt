#ITI#Biocrusts benefit from plant removal#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the Study: Productivity in drylands may depend on the sensitivity of interactions between plants and biocrusts. Given future climate variability, it is essential to understand how interactions may be context-dependent with precipitation regime. Furthermore, little is known about the additional interactions of these producers with the belowground biota (e.g., roots, fungi, microarthropods). We evaluated the effect of removal (such as could occur following disturbance) and net interaction of plants and biocrusts and additionally manipulated the abiotic and biotic context. Methods: We established field mesocosms containing grass (Bouteloua gracilis) and surrounding biocrusts, then clipped the plant or heat-sterilized the biocrust to simulate the loss of dryland producers. To test for context-dependency on the precipitation pattern, we imposed a large, infrequent or small, frequent precipitation regime. A mesh barrier was used to impede belowground connections that may couple the dynamics of producers. Productivity was assessed by plant biomass and biocrust chlorophyll content. Key Results: Biocrusts increased chlorophyll content more when plants were removed than when they were present in the first year, but only in the small, frequent precipitation regime. In contrast, plant growth slightly declined with biocrust removal. Plant biomass and biocrust chlorophyll content were negatively correlated in the second year, suggesting net competition. Belowground connectivity weakly promoted overall biocrust relative productivity, but was generally weakly detrimental to plant relative productivity. Conclusions: Altered precipitation patterns can amplify positive effects of plant removal on biocrust producers. Furthermore, we discovered that belowground networks contributed to dryland productivity by promoting biocrust performance. © 2018 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
