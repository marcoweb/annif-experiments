#ITI#Seed Priming Influences the Seed Quality and Activities of Nitrate Assimilation and Anti-Oxidant Enzymes in Pigeon Pea Seedlings#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were conducted with four levels of seed priming including control and two varieties of pigeon pea at ICAR-Indian Institute of Seed Science, Mau during three consecutive years (2011-12 to 2013-14). One-year-old seeds of pigeon pea varieties (Bahar and Malviya-13) were primed with growth regulator (100 ppm GA3), in-organic salt(0.2% KNO) and tap water (sanitized) 3 separately for 06 hrs. and sown in field under RBD with 03 replications. Observations were recorded on seed quality parameters, biochemical attributes including nitrate assimilatory enzymes and activities of anti-oxidant enzymes during seedling stage. Seed quality parameters including germination, seedling growth and vigor indices were significantly enhanced through seed priming with GA3 followed by KNO3 and tap water over unprimed control. Biochemical attributes viz; chlorophyll a andb contents, were more influenced with GA3 priming followed by KNO3 and tap water whereas the proline accumulation was reduced with priming treatments and maximum reduction was noted with GA3 followed by KNO3 and tap water. Enhancement in nitrate assimilatory enzymes including nitrate and nitrite reductase activities was more with KNO3 priming followed by GA3 and tap water. Anti-oxidant enzymes activities including Catalase, Peroxidase and Super Oxide Dismutase were also increased significantly by KNO3 priming followed by GA3 and tap water over unprimed control. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
