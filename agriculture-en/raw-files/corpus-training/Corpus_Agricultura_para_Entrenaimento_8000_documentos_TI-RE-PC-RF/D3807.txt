#ITI#Application of rhizobacteria for induction of systemic resistance to bacterial blight of cotton caused by xanthomonas campestris PV. Malvacearum using fluorescent pseudomonads of rhizosphere#FTI#
#IRE#The ability of fluorescent pseudomonads of cotton rhizosphere of induction of systemic resistance (ISR) against bacterial blight of cotton was investigated. Of the 21 isolates tested, 19 were observed to increase the resistance of plants. This was demonstrated by a lower percentage of infected leaf area. On the basis of growth promotion and ISR induction ability, isolates 148, 35Q, 16Q and 113 were selected for further investigations. All isolates increased the resistance of plants, and per cent of infected area on leaves of these treatments were lower than those control of plants. Levels of peroxidase (PO) and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity in the leaves of bacterized plants with selected isolates were similar to that in control plants, but after inoculation of leaves with the pathogen, the amount of these enzymes increased in bacterized plants to high levels. The increase of enzyme activity in control plants was low after inoculation.#FRE#
