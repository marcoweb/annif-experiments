#ITI#Effects of mixture ratio and cutting time on forage yield and silage quality of intercropped berseem clover and Italian ryegrass#FTI#
#IRE#The research was carried out to determine the effects of different mixture ratios and cutting times on dry-matter yield and silage quality of mixtures of bersem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) with Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in Adana province, Turkey. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with four replications during the years of 2011-2013. The mixture-ratios (80% BC + 20% IR, 60% BC + % 40 IR, 40% BC+ % 60 IR, 20% BC + 80 % IR, pure berseem clover (BC) and Italian ryegrass (IR)) were main plots, and harvest times (beginning of the flowering, mid flowering and full flowering of BC) were sub-plots. From the result of the study, it was concluded that the mixture of 60 % BC + 40 % IR harvested at full flowering of BC was superior in terms of dry matter yield and silage quality. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
