#ITI#Potassium attenuates drought damage by regulating sucrose metabolism and gene expression in sesame leaf#FTI#
#IRE#Drought has been considered the most restrictive environmental constraint on agricultural production worldwide. Photosynthetic carbohydrate metabolism is a critical biochemical process connected with crop production and quality traits. A pot experiment was carried out under four potassium (K) rates (0, 0.75, 1.5 and 2.25 g pot−1 of K, respectively) and two water regimes to investigate the role of K in activating defense mechanisms on sucrose metabolism against drought damage in sesame. The soil moisture contents are 75 ± 5% (well-watered, WW) and 45 ± 5% (drought stress, DS) of field capacity respectively. The results showed that DS plants without K application have lower activities of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco), sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), soluble acid invertase (SAI), and chlorophyll content and higher activity of sucrose synthase (SuSy), which resulted in declined synthesis and distribution of photosynthetic products to reproductive organs. Under drought, there was a significant positive correlation between leaf sucrose metabolizing enzymes and sucrose content. Plants subjected to drought stress increased the concentrations of soluble sugar and sucrose to produce osmo-protectants and energy sources for plants acclimating to stress but decreased starch content. Conversely, K application enhanced the carbohydrate metabolism, biomass accumulation and partitioning, thereby contributing to higher seed oil and protein yield (28.8%–43.4% and 27.5%–40.7%) as compared to K-deficiency plants. The positive impacts of K application enhanced as increasing K rates, and it was more pronounced in drought conditions. Furthermore, K application upregulated the gene expression of SiMYB57, SiMYB155, SiMYB176 and SiMYB192 while downregulated SiMYB108 and SiMYB171 in drought conditions, which may help to alleviate drought susceptibility. Conclusively, our study illustrated that the enhanced photo-assimilation and translocation process caused by the changes in sucrose metabolism activities under K application as well as regulation of MYB gene expression contributes towards drought resistance of sesame. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
