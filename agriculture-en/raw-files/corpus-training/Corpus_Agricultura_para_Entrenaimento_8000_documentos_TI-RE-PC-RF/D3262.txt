#ITI#Effect of water deficit on yield of different faba bean (Vicia faba L.) genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Faba beans (Vicia faba L.) are important grain legumes but, as with many crops, these are also susceptible to water deficit. The aim of this study was to evaluate the yield components of twenty faba bean genotypes grown under water deficit. Methods: Three water treatments were applied, 25%, 50% and 100% of field capacity. A split-plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design with three replicates was used. Result: The faba genotypes Gazira2, Kamline, L4, Cairo7 and Giza402 reached flowering earlier than other genotypes through stress-escape mechanisms. Genotypes L4, Gazira1, Kamline, X.735 and Gazira2 had the highest seed yield under water-deficit conditions. Genotypes L4, X.735, 989/309/95, Kamline and Gazira1 exhibited the highest levels of biological yield. Finally, the genotypes Kamline and L.4 had higher yields and yield components under water-deficit stress. Consequently, they should be considered for use in breeding programs aimed at developing new cultivars that are better adapted to harsh environmental conditions.
