#ITI#Heterosis and combining ability analysis for yield and yield contributing traits in Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Analysis of crosses involving six chickpea parents viz., KWR-108, IPC-94-19, DCP-92-3, IPC-97-72, IPC-94-94 and MPJG-2000-108 in diallel mating scheme was carried out to study heterosis and combing ability. Observations were recorded on eleven agronomical characters and seed protein content. Analysis of variance for experimental design revealed significant differences for all the traits except for number of branches per plant. Among the parents, IPC-94-19, IPC-97-72 and MPJG-2000-108 were found to be the best general combiners for yield and most of its contributing characters. Cross IPC-94-19 x IPC-94-94 showed the highest significant positive economic heterosis for grain yield per plant, biological yield per plant and number of pods per plant. Two crosses namely KWR-108 X DCP-92-3 and IPC-94-19 X DCP-92-3 found heterotic for grain yield and other component characters involved one parent as good combiner and these crosses will be useful for the production of superior transgressive segregants in advance generations.#FRE#
