#ITI#Genetics of some nutrients in groundnut (Arachis Hypogaea L.) under moisture-deficit stress situations#FTI#
#IRE#A study was under taken to work out the gene action responsible for the accumulation of five nutrients, namely Mn, N, K, Ca and Mg in leaf tissue of groundnut. Accumulation of Mn and Ca was found to be under the influence of both additive and non-additive gene effects with preponderance of the former. In case of N, Mg and K, genes that are mainly additive in nature were found to be important. Selection for these traits can be effective in the early generations. Maternal effects observed for accumulation of Mn, K and Mg are suggestive of the crucial role of selection of female parent in improvement for these traits. This study has helped in the identification of good general combiners for Ca (CSMG 84-1), Mn (Chico and ICGV 86031), N (TAG 24), K (ICG 4747) and Mg (CGMG 84-1 and TMV 2 NLM), which can be used in the genetic improvement of groundnut with desirable levels of these nutrients.#FRE#
