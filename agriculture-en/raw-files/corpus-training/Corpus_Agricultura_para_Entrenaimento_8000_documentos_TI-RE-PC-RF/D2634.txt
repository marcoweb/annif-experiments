#ITI#The Effects of Mesorhizobium ciceri Inoculation and Different Doses of Vermicompost Treatments on the Yield Components and Yield of Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) under Semi-arid Mediterranean Highland Condition of Turkey#FTI#
#IRE#Background: This study was conducted in 2016-2017 to determine the effects of Mesorhizobium ciceri inoculation and different doses of vermicompost applications on the yield components and yield of chickpea under semi-arid Mediterranean highland condition of Turkey. Methods: Mesorhizobium ciceri inoculant were applied to seeds (at 108 cfu bacteria per seed dose) as microbial fertilizer in the experiments. Vermicompost doses were 0, 1000, 2000 and 3000 kg ha-1. The trials were set up with three replications according to the randomized complete blocks design. Conclusion: Plant height, first pod height, pod number per plant, number of seeds per plant, 100 grain weight and grain yield were determined as 56.1-61.9 cm, 29.4-34.9 cm, 31.4-46.3 pods plant-1, 32.9-44.0 seed plant-1, 30.4-37.4 g and 1463-2072 kg ha-1, respectively. Co-application of 1000 kg ha-1 vermicompost with Mesorhizobium ciceri inoculation produced the highest values for all examined parameters for both years. Further applications of vermicompost reduced yield and related components. Control parcels and excess vermicompost applications (2000 and 3000 kg ha-1) produced lowest values. Mesorhizobium ciceri inoculation produced medium values between Co-application of 1000 kg ha-1 vermicompost with Mesorhizobium ciceri and control and excess vermicompost applied conditions. In conclusion, use of Mesorhizobium ciceri + 1000 kg ha-1 vermicompost was recommended in chickpea cultivation for maximum yield in the ecological conditions of Siirt province of Turkey or in similar ecologies. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
