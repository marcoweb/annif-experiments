#ITI#Heterosis for yield and its components in vegetable lablab bean (Lablab Purpureus L.)#FTI#
#IRE#A half diallel was taken up with eight parents with a view to obtain best heterotic crosses for vegetable yield and its attributing traits. Heterosis over better parent and standard check were estimated for yield and its contributing characters in 28 cross combinations. The hybrids viz., NBI-57 x NBI-69, NBI-69 x NBI-80, NBI-41 x NBI-69, NBI-32 x NBI-54 and NBI-23 x NBI-54 were the most heterotic for green pod yield per plant. The crosses exhibited highest heterosis due to increase in number of pods per plant significantly associated with increase in pod yield. In some crosses primary branches per plant, average pod weight, seeds per pod and pod length also contributed towards green pod yield per plant. The crosses showing highest heterotic effects and per se performance, these crosses could be considered for exploitation of hybrid vigour.#FRE#
