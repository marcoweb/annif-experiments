#ITI#Thermal Stability Study of Five Newcastle Disease Attenuated Vaccine Strains#FTI#
#IRE#SUMMARY Newcastle disease (ND) is a big concern throughout the world because of the devastating losses that can occur with commercial and backyard poultry. The major problem in many countries is the loss of the vaccine's effectiveness due to inadequate use or storage conditions, particularly in hot climates. In the present study, stability of the five, most-used NDV vaccine strains (I-2, LaSota, B1, Clone 30 [C30], and VG-GA) was tested comparatively at different storage temperatures (4 and 37 C for the freeze-dried form and 4, 24, 37, and 45 C for the freeze-dried vaccine reconstituted in diluents). The vaccine stability was evaluated by the cumulative infectious titer drop and the theoretical shelf life at particular temperatures. Results showed that I-2 and LaSota are the most stable vaccine strains compared to B1, C30, and VG-GA; they registered the lowest titer drops and the longest shelf life whether at cool, high, or room temperatures and for both freeze-dried and reconstituted vaccines. © 2016 American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
