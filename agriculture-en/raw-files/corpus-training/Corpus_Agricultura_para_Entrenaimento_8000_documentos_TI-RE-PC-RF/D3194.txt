#ITI#Influence of pigeonpea varieties, N levels and planting methods on yield and economics under rainfed conditions#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was conducted with the objective of understanding the response of pigeonpea varieties to N levels under different method of planting. It consisted of 16 treatments with four methods of planting in main plots, two varieties and two N levels in double split plot (DSP) design. The results of pooled data indicated that significantly higher plant population (50,683 ha-1) and seed yield (1255 kg ha-1) besides lower cost of cultivation (Rs. 27,875 ha-1), higher net returns (Rs. 33,698 ha-1) and B:C ratio (2.19) were recorded with normal planting (90x20 cm) compared to other planting methods. Transplanted pigeonpea (120x90 cm) had significantly higher stem girth (10.32 cm) and number of pods plant-1 (1483) besides on par seed yield (1100 kg ha-1) with that of normal planting. However, the yield improvement is not substantial to offset the additional costs involved in nursery raising and transplanting. Though the performance of transplanted pigeonpea (90x90 cm) and dibbling (90x90 cm) was similar with regard to seed yield, dibbling fared well with regard to net returns and B:C ratio. PRG-158 variety accrued an additional net returns of Rs. 2340 ha-1 over Asha, due to its short duration. N doses didn’t differ significantly in respect of growth parameters, yield attributes and yield. Thus, normal planting method (90x20 cm) with PRG-158 variety and 20 kg N ha-1 can be recommended on Alfisols under rainfed conditions. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
