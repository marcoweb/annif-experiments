#ITI#Interaction effect of phosphorus and sulphur application on nutrient uptake, yield and yield attributing parameters of black gram [Vigna mungo (L.) hepper]#FTI#
#IRE#The experiment comprising of four levels of phosphorus, i.e., 0, 20, 40 and 60 kg ha-1 and three levels of sulphur, i.e., 0, 15 and 30 kg ha-1, was conducted during summer of 2015-16 to investigate the interaction effect of phosphorus and sulphur application on nutrients uptake and yield of black gram cv. Uttara. The treatments were laid in randomized block design (Factorial) with three replications. The results revealed utmost concentration and uptake of phosphorus in seed (0.376% and 3.59 kg ha-1) and stover (0.266% and 6.38 kg ha-1) and sulphur in seed (0.397% and 3.79 kg ha-1) and stover (0.134% and 3.21 kg ha-1) with combined application of phosphorus 60 kg and sulphur 30 kg ha-1, indicating synergistic effect of phosphorus and sulphur on nutrient uptake, respectively. The results also revealed that combined application of phosphorus and sulphur showed synergistic effect on seed and stover yield of black gram with increasing levels of phosphorus and sulphur up to highest level as both the nutrients mutually help absorption and utilization by black gram probably due to balanced nutrition. The seed and stover yield were 955.50 and 2398.30 kg ha-1 with combined application of phosphorus 60 kg and sulphur 30 kg ha-1. The yield attributes of black gram viz., plant height, number of pods plant-1 and 100 seeds weight also increased significantly with increasing levels of phosphorus and sulphur up to highest level and the optimum values were recorded with combined application of phosphorus 60 kg and sulphur 30 kg ha-1. However, non-significant response of phosphorus and sulphur application has been observed in case of plant population (m-2). Â© 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
