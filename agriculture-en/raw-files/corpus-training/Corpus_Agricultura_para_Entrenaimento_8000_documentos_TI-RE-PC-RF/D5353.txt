#ITI#Squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and esophagus in a Japanese bantam rooster#FTI#
#IRE#Squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and esophagus was diagnosed in an adult Japanese bantam rooster. Grossly, a cauliflowerlike mass with irregular edges was found involving the ventrolateral surfaces of the caudal portion of the oropharynx and cervical portion of the esophagus. The large volume of the mass almost occluded the lumen of the alimentary passage. Histologically, the tumor consisted of irregular cords of pleomorphic epithelial cells that showed a disorganized pattern of growth and invaded the adjacent tissues. Keratinized epithelial cells and moderate numbers of keratin pearls were readily observed. The mitotic index was low, and, although the tumor was locally invasive, we found no evidence of vascular invasion or metastasis.#FRE#
