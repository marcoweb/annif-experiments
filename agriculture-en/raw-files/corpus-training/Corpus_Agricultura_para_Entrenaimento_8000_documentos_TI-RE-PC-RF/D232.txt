#ITI#Developmental and phytochemical changes in pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) using exogenous application of polyamines#FTI#
#IRE#Polyamines (PAs) are natural active compounds having more than two amino groups that play important roles in many physiological and developmental processes in plants. The purpose of this research was to see how foliar polyamine spray affected growth and photosynthetic indices, as well as secondary metabolites and antioxidant activity of the aqueous and methanolic extracts of pot marigold (Calendula officinalis L.). The experiment lasted for three months and was arranged in a randomized complete design with four replications. Three separate concentrations (0.5, 1 and 2.5 mM) of spermine (SPM), spermidine (SPD), and putrescine (PUT) were sprayed at four/five fully expanded leaf stage and some physiochemical attributes were evaluated. The treatments caused a significant increase in morphological and photosynthetic parameters and total oil. There were also significant variations in total phenolic and flavonoid content. Compared to other polyamines, 1 mM SPD foliar spraying showed the greatest effect. Furthermore, the highest antioxidant capacity (DPPH* scavenging assay, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and β-carotene bleaching activity) was observed in the 1 mM SPD treatment. The results showed that the calendula essential oils (EOs) were rich in sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons (55.92–95.94%), with c-Cadinene and d-Cadinene as the major sesquiterpenes in the EOs. Also, the flowers were rich sources of carotenoids (lutein, flavoxanthin and luteoxanthin) following polyamines application. Hence, it can be inferred that polyamines specially spermidine would find a wide range of application in pharmaceutical industries due to its impact on antioxidant properties of phenolic and flavonoid compounds. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
