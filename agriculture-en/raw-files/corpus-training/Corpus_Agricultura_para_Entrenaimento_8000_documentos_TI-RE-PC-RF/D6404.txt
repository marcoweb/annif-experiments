#ITI#Pollen performance decreases with plant age for outcrosser but not selfer: evidence for cost of male performance#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Declines in reproductive capabilities with increasing age are common across the tree of life. However, in plants, mating system traits have rarely been tested for signs of senescence. Since reproduction is often resource limited, we might expect outcrossing and selfing taxa to allocate these resources differently, especially as a plant ages. Compared with selfers, outcrossers are expected to produce showy, rewarding flowers that attract pollinators and high-quality pollen that can successfully compete for ovules. Yet, this resource-intensive strategy of outcrossers may result in declines in floral allocation and pollen performance metrics, relative to selfers. Methods: To explore age-related changes in reproduction, we measured flower size and pollen germinability over the flowering period for multiple populations of an annual sister species pair, Collinsia linearis (outcrosser) and C. rattanii (selfer), in a growth chamber experiment. Results: We found that flower size decreased significantly with age in both species. The outcrosser expressed a significant and dramatic (88%) decline in pollen germinability with age, while the selfer's pollen germinability decline was non-significant and low (17%). Conclusions: Our results support the idea that the higher total cost of reproduction in outcrossers can deplete available resources more rapidly than in selfers, manifesting as a decline in male performance with plant age. © 2019 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
