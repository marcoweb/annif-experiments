#ITI#Comparative Study of the Effect of Different Weed Management Strategies on Disease Severity and Marketable Yield of Paprika (Capsicum Annuum L.) in the Smallholder Farming Sector of Zimbabwe#FTI#
#IRE#On-farm trials were conducted in the Chinyika Resettlement Area of Zimbabwe under dryland conditions to investigate the effects of different weed management methods on disease incidence, severity and paprika (Capsicum annuum) pod yield. The weed control treatments included hand weeding at 2 and 6 weeks after transplanting (WAT); ridge re-moulding at 3,6 and 9 WAT; application 41/ha Lasso (alachlor) immediately after transplanting, and Ronstar (oxidiazinon) at 21/ha tank mixed with Lasso at 21/ha one day before transplanting. The herbicide-water solution was applied at the rate of 2001/ha using a knapsack sprayer. Major diseases identified were bacterial leaf spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria), cercospora leaf spot (Cercospora unamunoi), grey leaf spot (Stemphylium solani) and powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica) in both seasons. For the 2000/2001 season hand weeding at 2 and 6 WAT and ridge re-moulding at 3, 6 and 9 WAT had the greatest reduction effect on the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and the highest marketable fruit yield. In the 2001/2002 season, both herbicide treatments had the same effect as hand weeding and ridge re-moulding on AUDPC and marketable fruit yield. The least weed density was obtained by ridge re-moulding at 3, 6, and 9 WAT in the 2000/2001 season. Weed density was statistically the same across all treatments except the check treatment in 2001/2002 season. Hand weeding operations were significantly (p < 0.05) effective and consequently gave the highest added profits mainly because of their effect on major weeds such as Datura stramonium.
