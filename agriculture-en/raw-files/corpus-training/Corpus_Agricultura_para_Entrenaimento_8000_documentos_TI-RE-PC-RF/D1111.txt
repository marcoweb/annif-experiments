#ITI#Plasticity in branch water relations and stem hydraulic vulnerability enhances hydraulic safety in mangroves growing along a salinity gradient#FTI#
#IRE#Coping with water stress depends on maintaining cellular function and hydraulic conductance. Yet measurements of vulnerability to drought and salinity do not often focus on capacitance in branch organs that buffer hydraulic function during water stress. The relationships between branch water relations, stem hydraulic vulnerability and stem anatomy were investigated in two co-occurring mangroves Aegiceras corniculatum and Rhizophora stylosa growing at low and high salinity. The dynamics of branch water release acted to conserve water content in the stem at the expense of the foliage during extended drying. Hydraulic redistribution from the foliage to the stem increased stem relative water content by up to 21%. The water potentials at which 12% and 50% loss of stem hydraulic conductivity occurred decreased by ~1.7 MPa in both species between low and high salinity sites. These coordinated tissue adjustments increased hydraulic safety despite declining turgor safety margins at higher salinity sites. Our results highlight the complex interplay of plasticity in organ-level water relations with hydraulic vulnerability in the maintenance of stem hydraulic function in mangroves distributed along salinity gradients. These results emphasise the importance of combining water relations and hydraulic vulnerability parameters to understand vulnerability to water stress across the whole plant. © 2023 The Authors.
