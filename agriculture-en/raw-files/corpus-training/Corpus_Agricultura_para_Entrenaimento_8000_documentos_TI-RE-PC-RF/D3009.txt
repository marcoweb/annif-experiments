#ITI#Bioefficacy of novel insecticides against pod borer, (Helicoverpa armigera Hubner) in pigeonpea#FTI#
#IRE#The bio efficacy of some new insecticides and their combinations against pod borer infesting pigeonpea was evaluated at Agronomy farm, RCA, Udaipur using four dosages of Chlorantraniliprole 9.6% + Lambdacyhalothrin 4.6% @ 150, 200, 250 and 300 ml/ha along with Lambdacyhalothrin 4.9 % CS @ 500 ml / ha, Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 162 ml / ha, Profenophos 50 EC @ 1500 ml / ha and Indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 517 ml / ha. Among the various insecticides, lowest population of larvae with a mean of 3.65, 4.16, 2.25 and 2.16 larvae/10 plants was recorded in Chlorantraniliprole 9.6% + Lambdacyhalothrin 4.6% at 300 ml/ha as against 35.10, 37.0, 39.55 and 38.47 larvae/10 plants in untreated control during 2011 at 7 and 14 days after first and second spray, respectively which was found at par with Chlorantraniliprole 9.6% + Lambdacyhalothrin 4.6% at 200, and 250 ml/ha. Similar results were also recorded during 2012 with larval population in the range of 2.10 –7.16/ 10 plants in Chlorantraniliprole 9.6% + Lambdacyhalothrin 4.6% treated plot @ 200,250 and 300 ml/ha. Chlorantraniliprole 9.6% + Lambdacyhalothrin 4.6% at 300ml/ha caused highest reduction in pod borer larvae during both the years with a mean reduction of 91.86 and 89.14 per cent during kharif 2011 and 2012, respectively. The seed yield among different treatments ranged from 6.75 to 9.50 and 7.87 to 10.78q/ha against 5.35and 6.45 q/ha in untreated control during kharif 2011 and 2012, respectively. The highest seed yield of 9.50 and 10.78 q/ha/ha was recorded in case of spray of Chlorantraniliprole 9.6% + Lambdacyhalothrin 4.6% at 300 ml/ha during kharif 2011 and 2012, respectively. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
