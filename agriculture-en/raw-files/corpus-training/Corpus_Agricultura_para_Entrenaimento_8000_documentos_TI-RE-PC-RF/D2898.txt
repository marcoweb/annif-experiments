#ITI#Estimation of yield losses by pod borer complex in greengram#FTI#
#IRE#Investigations were carried out to evaluate the yield losses caused by pod borer complex on greengram during kharif, 2008 at College Farm, Junagadh Agricultural University, Junagadh. The results revealed that lower larval population of pod borers was observed in protected plots than unprotected plots. Significantly minimum pod damage (12.94%) and grain damage (9.47%) were recorded from protected plots. By providing protection with the endosulfan 0.07 % and monocrotophos 0.04 % alternatively at weekly intervals starting from flowering stage to the pod maturity stage of the crop, 513.67 kg/ha grain yield and 36.41 % avoidable yield loss can be saved.#FRE#
