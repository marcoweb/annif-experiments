#ITI#Bio-efficacy of insecticides against helicoverpa armigera in chickpea#FTI#
#IRE#The study was carried out to evaluate bio-efficacy of some insecticides against Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) in chickpea during rabi 2014-15 and 2015-16 at the Students’ Instructional Farm (SIF) of Chandra Shekhar Azad University of Agriculture and Technology, Kanpur. Minimum surviving and maximum reduction percentage of larval population was recorded in T5 (Spinosad 45 EC @ 166 ml/ ha), whereas maximum surviving and minimum reduction percentage of larval population was recorded in T1 (HaNPV @ 250 LE/ha) at 3rd, 7th and 10th days after spray. Significantly higher seed yield was obtained in case of (T5) Spinosad 45 SC (2550 kg ha-1 in 1st and 2680 kg ha-1 in 2nd year), respectively. Based on benefit: cost ratio of different treatments, (T5) Spinosad 45 SC ha-1 was found to be most economic insecticide, because it gave the maximum benefit as compared to remaining treatments. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
