#ITI#Genetic variability for nutritional quality in Lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus Subsp. culinaris)#FTI#
#IRE#Lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus Subsp. culinaris) is important dietary source of macro and micro-nutrients essential for human health. It provides essential amino acids to meet nutrient requirements. In order to develop macro/micro-nutrient rich lines, it is essential to know the level of genetic variability in the lentil accessions. A preliminary evaluation of seeds of 234 germplasm collected from various countries was carried out to understand the macro and micro-nutrient concentration level of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, iron, manganese, boron, copper and zinc which are essential nutrients for maintaining human health. Substantial variability of mineral concentration was estimated across the accessions. Highest seed concentrations (in mg kg-1) were recorded in ILL8194 [P (5800); K (13600)], ILL8105 [Ca (1860)], ILL7200 [Mg (1300)], ILL6212 [S (3100)], ILL7547 [Fe (86)], ILL9886 [Mn (20)], ILL6459 [B (9.7)], ILL1005 [Cu (17)] and ILL5480 [Zn (60)]. Significant correlation was observed among the macro and micro-nutrients. Highest positive correlation was observed between Ca and Mg followed by K and S, P and K, and Ca and B; and K showed higher negative correlation with B and Ca. The high nutrient-content accessions identified in this study will be used as parents in developing nutritious lentils at ICARDA and by its cooperating national partner institutions. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
