#ITI#Evaluation of the non-temperature-sensitive field clonal isolates of the mycoplasma synoviae vaccine strain MS-H#FTI#
#IRE#The live attenuated temperature-sensitive (ts+) Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) strain, MS-H, is used as a vaccine in a number of countries to control virulent MS infection in commercial chicken flocks. Nine out of 50 isolates made from flocks vaccinated with MS-H were found to have lost the ts+ phenotype of the original vaccine strain. In order to examine the influence of the ts- phenotype on virulence of the isolates, four of the ts- isolates, the MS-H vaccine, and the vaccine parent strain 86079/7NS were administered by aerosol in conjunction with infectious bronchitis virus to 3-wk-old specific-pathogen-free chickens. The four ts- clones induced only minimal air sac lesions that were not different in severity from those caused by MS-H vaccine; however, the vaccine parent strain 86079/7NS caused air sac lesions that were significantly greater than those of MS-H and all ts- clones. The vaccine parent strain 86079/7NS and two of the ts- clones were recovered from the air sacs of the respectively infected chickens whereas the MS-H vaccine and two other ts- clones were not. Three of the ts- isolates caused increased tracheal mucosal thicknesses that were significantly greater than those from birds inoculated with MS-H, and one caused increased tracheal mucosal thicknesses that were significantly less than those from birds inoculated with 86079/7NS. In conclusion, unlike the MS-H vaccine, the MS-H ts- clones were associated with minor changes in tracheal mucosa; however, unlike the vaccine parent strain, they did not induce lesions in the air sacs. These results suggest that factors other than ts+ phenotype are involved in the attenuation of the MS-H vaccine.#FRE#
