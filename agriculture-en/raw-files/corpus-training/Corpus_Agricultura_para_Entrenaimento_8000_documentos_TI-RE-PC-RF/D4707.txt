#ITI#Sequence analysis of both genome segments of three Croatian infectious bursal disease field viruses#FTI#
#IRE#In order to determine the mutations responsible for virulence, three Croatian field infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDV), designated Cro-Ig/02, Cro-Po/00, and Cro-Pa/98 were characterized. Coding regions of both genomic segments were sequenced, and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were compared with previously reported full-length sequenced IBDV strains. Phylogenetic analysis, based on the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of polyprotein and VP1, was performed. Eight characteristic amino acid residues, that were common to very virulent (vv) IBDV, were detected on polyprotein: 222A, 256I, 294I, 451L, 685N, 715S, 751D, and 1005A. All eight were found in Cro-Ig/02 and Cro-Po/00. C-Pa/98 had all the characteristics of an attenuated strain, except for glutamine on residue 253, which is common for vv, classical virulent, and variant strains. Between less virulent and vvIBDV, three substitutions were found on VP5: 49 G→R, 79 I→F, and 137 R→W. In VP1, there were nine characteristic amino acid residues common to vvIBDV: 146D, 147N, 242E, 390M, 393D, 511S, 562P, 687P, and 695R. All nine residues were found in A-Ig/02, and eight were found in B-Po/00, which had isoleucine on residue 390. Based on our analyses, isolates Cro-Ig/02 and Cro-Po/00 were classified with vv IBDV strains. C-Pa/98 shared all characteristic amino acid residues with attenuated and classical virulence strains, so it was classified with those.#FRE#
