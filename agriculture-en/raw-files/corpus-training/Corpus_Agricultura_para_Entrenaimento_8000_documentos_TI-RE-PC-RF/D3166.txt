#ITI#Effect of Hydrogen Peroxide Pretreatment on Physiological and Biochemical Variables during Germination of Alfalfa Seeds#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Hydrogen peroxide is reactive oxygen species that plays role in plant response to biotic and abiotic stress. The pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide can confer an adaptive capacity for the plants in unpredictable environments. The alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is the legume more utilized in animal feeding in the world. Moreover, the alfalfa sprouts are known for the phytochemicals that promote health with antioxidant properties. Methods: This work aimed to determine the effect of hydrogen peroxide in the pretreatment process of alfalfa seeds on variables as total germination, speed of germination, activity and antioxidant enzymes. The alfalfa seeds were soaked for 12 h in the next treatments 0, 98, 294, 490, 784, 980 mM of hydrogen peroxide. Result: The results showed that total germination was higher with the hydrogen peroxide than with water except 980 mM. The results of the present research indicated that hydrogen peroxide had physiological and biochemical effects on the germination processes of alfalfa.
