#ITI#Phosphorus transformation in a soybean-cropping system in Andosol: Effects of winter cover cropping and compost application#FTI#
#IRE#Understanding phosphorus (P) transformation is necessary to develop sustainable P management practices on Andosol with large P-fixing capacity. This study was conducted during 2005-2007 in northeastern Japan to determine how the amounts of inorganic P (Pi) and organic P (Po) fractions change in a Silandic Andosol under soybean production [Glycine max (L.)]. Two treatments were examined: application of composted cattle manure (0 (P0), 61 (P1), and 122 or 183 (P2) kg P ha-1 year-1) and winter cover cropping (no cover crop, rapeseed [Brassica napus], and cereal rye [Secale cereale L.]). Compost was applied before soybean seeding; cover crops were seeded after soybean harvest without further fertilization. Soil P was extracted sequentially with anion exchange resin (Pi), 0.5M NaHCO3 (Pi, Po), 0.1M NaOH (Pi, Po), and 0.5M H2SO4 (Pi). Soybean removed 42.3 and 48.5 kg P ha-1 (only 23 and 10% of the added P), respectively, in P1 and P2. In the P2 soil, 64% of excess P was distributed into Pi fractions, mainly resin-Pi and NaOH-Pi (29 and 19%, respectively). In P0, despite no P addition, soybean removed 41.5 kg P ha-1 concurrently with a decrease in NaOH-Pi, suggesting its potential contribution to soybean P uptake. Neither of cover crops had significant effect on soil P fractions during the 3 year period. Â© Springer Science+Business Media B.V 2009.#FRE#
