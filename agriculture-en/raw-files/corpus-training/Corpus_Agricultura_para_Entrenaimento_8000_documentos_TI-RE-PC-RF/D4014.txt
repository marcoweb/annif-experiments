#ITI#Flock prevalence of exposure to avian adeno-associated virus, chicken anemia virus, fowl adenovirus, and infectious bursal disease virus among ontario broiler chicken flocks#FTI#
#IRE#Samples from 231 randomly selected commercial broiler chicken flocks in Ontario were tested at slaughter for exposure to chicken anemia virus (CAV), fowl adenovirus (FAdV), and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Fifteen blood samples per flock were collected and analyzed for the presence of antibodies against CAV, FAdV, and IBDV by ELISA or agar gel immunodiffusion test. Fifteen cecal tonsils and cloacal swabs per flock were analyzed for the presence of CAV, FAdV, and IBDV by PCR. The prevalence of exposure to avian adeno-associated virus (AAAV) was estimated by a PCR test on a subset of FAdV-PCR-positive samples from 178 flocks. Genotypes of FAdV and IBDV were identified on a subset of isolates (n = 353 and 45, respectively). The flock-level period prevalence of exposure to AAAV, CAV, FAdV, and IBDV during grow-out were 88.76% (95% CI: 84.08-93.45%), 77.06% (95% CI: 71.59-82.52%), 96.54% (95% CI: 94.16-98.91%), and 48.92% (95% CI: 42.42-55.41%), respectively. Results of a multivariable logistic regression model showed a significant association of exposure to FAdV with exposure to AAAV (OR = 18.57, 95% CI: 3.67-93.86, P = 0.004) but not with exposure to CAV (P = 0.7752) or exposure to IBDV (P= 0.2274). Pathogenic FAdV genotypes (FAdV-02, FAdV-08, and FAdV-11) constituted 39.38% of the isolates. The most-common IBDV genotypes identified were IBDV NC171 (60%) and IBDV 05SA8 (28.89%). This is the first large-scale study to estimate the baseline flock prevalence of exposure to AAAV, CAV, FAdV, and IBDV in commercial broiler flocks in Canada. Potentially pathogenic genotypes of FAdV and IBDV that can guide vaccine development and disease control efforts in Ontario were identified. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
