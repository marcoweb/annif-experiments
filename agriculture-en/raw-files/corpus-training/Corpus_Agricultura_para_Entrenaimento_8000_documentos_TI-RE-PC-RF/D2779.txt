#ITI#Efficacy of some botanicals against pulse beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis (L.) in Chickpea#FTI#
#IRE#The pulse beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis (L.) is the major pest of stored chickpea grain causing substantial loss in the storage. Plant products viz. neem (seed kernel powder and oil), mustard oil, groundnut oil, turmeric powder and turmeric powder mixture with mustard oil and groundnut oil were evaluated for their deterrent effect on adult mortality and emergence, oviposition and seed damage caused by C. chinensis in chickpea. All the oils gave significantly higher adult mortality as compared to untreated control. On the basis of number of eggs laid, adult emergence and seed damage except neem seed kernel powder and turmeric powder all treatments were considered as most effective against C. chinensis.#FRE#
