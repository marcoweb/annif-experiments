#ITI#Role of Potassium on Growth, Nitrogen Fixation and Biochemical Traits in [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] under Water Stress#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Water stress is a global issue to ensure survival of agricultural crops. Mungbean has a great nutritional value, short-duration and has an advantage that it can grow in wide range of soils and environments. For the present study, two varieties of mungbean were selected and raised in earthen pots. Methods: Water stress was imposed at 50% flowering (35-40 days after sowing) and plants were sampled at this stage. The control plants maintained at soil moisture content (SMC) of 12.0±0.5% and in stressed plants, water stress was created by withholding irrigation till SMC decreased to 4.5±0.5%. In legumes, damaging effects of drought can be reduced by potassium supply. Potassium was supplied to the soil at concentration 0.00, 1.54 mM, 2.31 mM, 3.08 mM. Result: This article includes water stress-induced harmful effects on mungbean growth and development, nitrogen fixation and biochemical traits and suggests that different concentrations of potassium fertilizer help to reduce the negative effect of water stress. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
