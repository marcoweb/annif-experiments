#ITI#The FLOWERING LOCUS T 5b positively regulates photoperiodic flowering and improves the geographical adaptation of soybean#FTI#
#IRE#Plants can sense the photoperiod to flower at the right time. As a sensitive short-day crop, soybean (Glycine max) flowering varies greatly depending on photoperiods, affecting yields. Adaptive changes in soybeans rely on variable genetic loci such as E1 and FLOWERING LOCUS T orthologs. However, the precise coordination and control of these molecular components remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that GmFT5b functions as a crucial factor for soybean flowering. Overexpressed or mutated GmFT5b resulted in significantly early or later flowering, altering expression profiles for several downstream flowering-related genes under a long-day photoperiod. GmFT5b interacts with the transcription factor GmFDL15, suggesting transcriptional tuning of flowering time regulatory genes via the GmFT5b/GmFDL15 complex. Notably, GmFT5a partially compensated for GmFT5b function, as ft5a ft5b double mutants exhibited an enhanced late-flowering phenotype. Association mapping revealed that GmFT5b was associated with flowering time, maturity, and geographical distribution of soybean accessions, all associated with the E1 locus. Therefore, GmFT5b is a valuable target for enhancing regional adaptability. Natural variants or multiple mutants in this region can be utilized to generate optimized soybean varieties with precise flowering times. Â© 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
