#ITI#Aging varies greatly within a single genus: A demographic study of Rhododendron spp. in botanic gardens#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: There is mounting evidence that age matters in plant demography, but also indications that relationships between age and demographic rates may vary significantly among species. Age-based plant demographic data, however, are time-consuming to collect and still lacking for most species, and little is known about general patterns across species or what may drive differences. Methods: We used individual birth and death records for 12 Rhododendron species from botanic gardens and conducted Bayesian survival trajectory analyses to assess how mortality changed with age. We calculated the demographic measures of aging rate, life-span equality, and life expectancy for each species, and assessed their relationships with the climatic conditions at species’ sites of ancestral origin and with taxonomic group (subgenus). Results: We found substantial among-species variation in survival trajectories, with mortality increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant with advancing age. Moreover, we found no relationships between demographic measures and ancestral climatic conditions but there were statistically significant differences among taxonomic groups in the rate of change in mortality with age (aging rate). Conclusions: We conclude that demographic consequences of aging can differ qualitatively, even among species in the same genus. In addition, taxonomic trends in aging rates indicate they may be genetically determined, though evolutionary drivers are still unclear. Furthermore, we suggest there is untapped potential in using botanic garden records in future studies on plant life history. © 2023 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
