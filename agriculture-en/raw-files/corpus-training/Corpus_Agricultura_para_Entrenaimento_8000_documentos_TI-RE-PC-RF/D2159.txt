#ITI#Characterization of phosphorus availability in selected New Zealand grassland soils#FTI#
#IRE#Appropriate evaluation of phosphorus (P) availability in soil is a prerequisite for ensuring the productivity and long-term sustainable management of agroecosystems. Fifteen soils presently under grassland were collected from different areas of New Zealand and soil P availability was assessed by isotopic exchange kinetics (IEK) and related to P forms obtained by chemical fractionation (sequential extraction). Concentrations of total P determined in the 15 soils ranged from 375 to 2607 mg kg-1 (mean 1104 mg kg-1). Mean concentrations of inorganic P (Pi) extracted by sequential extraction with ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide (first), hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide (second) were 1.2, 41, 205, 113 and 23 mg kg-1, respectively. Mean concentrations of organic P (Po) extracted by sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide (first) and sodium hydroxide (second) were 133, 417 and 105 mg kg-1, respectively. Similarly, results from IEK analysis showed that the intensity (water soluble Pi (Cp)), capacity (R/r1 and n), and quantity (E value, isotopically exchangeable P pools (E1 min, E1 min-24 h, E24 h-3 m, E> 3 m)) factors varied markedly amongst soils. Thus Cp concentrations ranged from 0.02-1.90 mg L-1, while concentrations of Pi determined in the E1 min, E1 min-24, E24 h-3 m, E>3 m pools were 2-29 (mean 10), 10-321 (76), 11-745 (152), and 8-498 (177) mg kg-1, respectively. The corresponding values for R/r1 and n were 1.0-17.7 (mean 4.5) and 0.10-0.50 (mean 0.37), respectively. Regression analysis revealed that Cp concentrations were exponentially and inversely proportional to R/r1, n and P sorption index (PSI) (R2 = 0.806 (P < 0.01), 0.852 (P < 0.01) and 0.660 (P < 0.01), respectively). Cluster analysis identified two broad groups of soils, namely those with low P availability (mean Cp 0.11 mg L-1, E1 min, Pi 5 mg kg-1, R/r1 3.9, n 0.44), and those with high P availability (mean Cp 1.33 mg L-1, E1 min Pi 20 mg kg-1, R/r1 1.21, n 0.16). Correlation analysis indicated that E1 min, Pi was significantly correlated with bicarbonate extractable Pi (BPi, R2 = 0.37, P < 0.05) and the sum of ammonium chloride extractable Pi (APi) and BPi (R2 = 0.38, P < 0.05). However, the concentration of Pi in the E1 min pool was generally lower than the sum of APi and BPi. Sodium hydroxide extractable Pi (N1Pi) was significantly correlated with the sum of the E1 min, E1 min-24 h, E24 h-3 m Pi pools (R2 = 0.974, P < 0.01), indicating that N1Pi fraction could be considered as representing potentially available soil P for pasture species over a growing season.#FRE#
