#ITI#Late season nitrogen fertilization of soybeans: Effects on leaf senescence, yield and environment#FTI#
#IRE#Nitrogen demand from soybean seeds during seed filling is very high and has been proposed as the cause of nitrogen remobilization and leaf senescence. Previous research has not shown consistent effects of late season fertilization on seed yield, while its effects on leaf senescence have not been evaluated. Two field experiments were performed to determine the effects of a late season N fertilization on leaf senescence and fall, seed yield and its components, and residual soil nitrate, and to evaluate the potential risk of groundwater contamination. Two rates of nitrogen (50 and 100 kg N ha-1) were applied at the R3 and R5 development stages. Nitrogen fertilization, either at R3 or R5, increased soil nitrate availability during the seed-filling period. Seed yield, seed number and protein content were not affected by N fertilization. The addition of 100 kg N ha-1 produced a small delay of 1-2 days in the leaf fall, and slightly increased seed size (3.6%). Our results suggest that increasing soil N availability during the seed-filling period is not an effective way to delay leaf senescence or to in-crease seed growth and yield of soybean. Nitrogen fertilization increased the level of residual nitrate in the top soil at one site (the one with lowest seed yield), increasing the risk of nitrate leaching during subsequent fallow.#FRE#
