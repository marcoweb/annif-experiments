#ITI#Bilateral effects of vaccination against infectious bursal disease and Newcastle disease in specific-pathogen-free layers and commercial broiler chickens#FTI#
#IRE#Different infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) live vaccines (intermediate, intermediate plus) were compared for their immunosuppressive abilities in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) layer-type chickens or commercial broilers. The Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccination model was applied to determine not only IBDV-induced immunosuppression but also bilateral effects between IBDV and NDV. None of the IBDV vaccines abrogated NDV vaccine-induced protection. All NDV-vaccinated SPF layers and broilers were protected against NDV challenge independent of circulating NDV antibody levels. Sustained suppression of NDV antibody development was observed in SPF layers, which had received the intermediate plus IBDV vaccine. We observed a temporary suppression of NDV antibody development in broilers vaccinated with one of the intermediate, as well as the intermediate plus, IBDV vaccines. Different genetic backgrounds, ages, and residual maternal antibodies might have influenced the pathogenesis of IBDV in the different types of chickens. Temporary suppression of NDV antibody response in broilers was only seen if the NDV vaccine was administered before and not, as it was speculated previously, at the time the peak of IBDV-induced bursa lesions was detected. For the first time, we have demonstrated that the NDV vaccine had an interfering effect with the pathogenesis of the intermediate as well as the intermediate plus IBDV vaccine. NDV vaccination enhanced the incidence of IBDV bursa lesions and IBDV antibody development. This observation indicates that this bilateral effect of an IBDV and NDV vaccination should be considered in the field and could have consequences for the performance of broiler flocks.#FRE#
