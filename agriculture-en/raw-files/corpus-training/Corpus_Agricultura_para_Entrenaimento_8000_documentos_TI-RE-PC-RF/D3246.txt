#ITI#Devising selection criteria based on variability and association studies in segregating populations derived from an interspecific cross between Cajanus scarabaeoides × C. Cajan#FTI#
#IRE#Segregating populations (BC1 F3 and F3:4) from an interspecific cross (C. scarabaeoides × C. cajan) were evaluated for variability and association studies for yield and its component traits. In both the generations, high values of PCV and GCV were obtained for pods per plant, seed yield per plant and fruiting branches per plant. High estimates of heritability as well as genetic advance were observed for fruiting branches per plant followed by pods per plant and seed yield per plant. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance revealed the presence of less environmental influence and prevalence of additive gene action. Seed yield per plant had highly significant and positive association with pods per plant, fruiting branches and 100-seed weight. Path coefficient analysis revealed that pods per plant, fruiting branches and 100-seed weight contributing maximum towards seed yield per plant. The study revealed that fruiting branches and pods per plant could be used as selection criteria for improving yield. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
