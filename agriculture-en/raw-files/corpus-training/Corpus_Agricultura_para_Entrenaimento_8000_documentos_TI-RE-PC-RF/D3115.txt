#ITI#Genetic variation and correlation studies between micronutrient (Fe and Zn), protein content and yield attributing traits in mungbean (Vigna. radiata L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Mungbean can effectively contribute in alleviation of iron, zinc and protein malnutrition as it is a source of micronutrients and protein. To improve this cultivars have to be developed which are rich in micronutrients and protein. But in general more focus is given to quantitative traits such as yield. Breeding mungbean for enhanced grain nutrients is still in its startup phase. The present study was carried out to access genetic variation for both quantitative as qualitative traits. The correlation between important traits such as yield and Fe, Zn, protein content was calculated. A positive correlation was found between iron and zinc content (r = 0.47) whereas no significant correlation with grain yield was observed indicating no compromise of yield for improving quality. Breeding a cultivar which is nutritionally improved along with high yield is therefore possible. A few promising cultivars with high micronutrients, protein and yield were identified. These cultivars can be used in specific breeding programs aiming at nutrient-rich high yielding cultivars. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
