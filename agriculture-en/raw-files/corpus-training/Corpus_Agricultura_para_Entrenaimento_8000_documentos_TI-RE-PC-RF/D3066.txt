#IRE#Pre-storage seed invigoration treatment in freshly harvested soybean seeds [Glycine max (L.)Merrill, cv. Soyamax] with powdered crude plant materials (red chilli powder@1g/kg of seed; neem leaf powder@2g/kg of seed), chemicals (iodinated calcium carbonate@2g/kg of seed; para-amino benzoic acid and ferulic acid@500mg/kg of seed) and; pharmaceuticals (aspirin @50mg/kg of seed) significantly improved germinability, field performance and productivity over control. Among the treatments, Ferulic acid, aspirin and para-amino benzoic acid showed better results in improving storability and field performance. The wet treatments, soaking-drying showed adverse effect on germinability due to soaking injury. Biochemical studies revealed that the activity of dehydrogenase, amylase (α, β free and β bound), catalase and peroxidase enzymes were higher in all dry treated seeds compared to the untreated control. Among the treatments, ferulic acid followed by aspirin has shown higher enzyme activity. On the basis of the results, pre-storage dry treatments with ferulic acid, aspirin and para-amino benzoic acid may be suggested for improving storability and field performance of stored soybean seed. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
