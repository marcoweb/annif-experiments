#ITI#Genetic analysis of various quantitative traits in inter-varietal crosses of Vigna mungo#FTI#
#IRE#Gene effects for 13 characters in four crosses of Vigna mungo were studied by six parameter generation mean model to determine the potential for the improvement of yield components. Scaling tests revealed inadequacy of the additivedominance model for all the traits indicating the presence of non-allelic interactions. Duplicate gene action was observed for six characters in KUG-216 x HPBU-111, five in KUG-216 x Palampur-93, two in IPU-05-13 x Palampur-93 and one in IPU-05-13 x HPBU-111 and complementary gene action for one character each in KUG-216 x Palampur-93 and IPU-05-13 x HPBU-111 cross. Selection in later generations for duplicate gene action and early generation selection involving intermatings in F2 for complementary gene action should be adopted for harnessing desirable recombinants.
