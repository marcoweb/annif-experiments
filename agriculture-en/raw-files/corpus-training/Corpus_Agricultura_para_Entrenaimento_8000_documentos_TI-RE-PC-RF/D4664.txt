#ITI#Molecular characterization of Brazilian infectious bursal disease virus isolated from 1997 to 2005#FTI#
#IRE#This retrospective study concerned 41 infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) isolates obtained from Brazilian broiler and layers flocks by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-five of them were identified as very virulent (vv) by restriction enzyme analysis and by further nucleotide and phylogenetic analysis. All of them had the typical amino acid residues, and all clustered in a phylogenetic tree with the vvIBDV strains. Four amino acid substitutions, at positions D213N, G254D, S317R, and D323E, were common to 3 vv isolates, Br/03/DB, Br/03/CK, and Br/04/CR, and differed from other vv isolates and strains. These isolates came from the same locale, but were collected in different years, indicating that the vvIBDVs circulating on Brazilian farms are undergoing slight but continuous exchanges.#FRE#
