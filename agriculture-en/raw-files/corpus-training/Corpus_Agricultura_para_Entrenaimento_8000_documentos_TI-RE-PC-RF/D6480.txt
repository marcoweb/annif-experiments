#ITI#Microgeographic variation in early fitness traits of Pinus sylvestris from contrasting soils#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: The possibility of fine-scale intraspecific adaptive divergence under gene flow is established by theoretical models and has been confirmed empirically in tree populations distributed along steep altitudinal clines or across extreme edaphic discontinuities. However, the possibility of microgeographic adaptive divergence due to less severe but more frequent kinds of soil variation is unclear. Methods: In this study, we looked for evidence of local adaptation to calcareous versus siliceous soil types in two nearby Mediterranean Pinus sylvestris populations connected via pollen flow. Using a greenhouse experiment, we tested for variation in early (up to three years of age) seedling performance among open-pollinated maternal families originating from each edaphic provenance when experimentally grown on both types of natural local substrate. Results: Although seedlings were clearly affected by the edaphic environment, exhibiting lower and slower emergence as well as higher mortality on the calcareous than in the siliceous substrate, neither the performance on each substrate nor the plasticity among substrates varied significantly with seedling edaphic provenance. Conclusions: We found no evidence of local adaptation to a non-extreme edaphic discontinuity over a small spatial scale, at least during early stages of seedling establishment. Future studies on microgeographic soil-driven adaptation should consider long-term experiments to minimize maternal effects and allow a potentially delayed expression of edaphic adaptive divergence. © 2023 The Authors.
