#ITI#Triacontanol delivery by nano star shaped polymer promoted growth in maize#FTI#
#IRE#Plant Growth Regulators (PGRs) are functional compounds known for enhancing plant growth and development. However, their environmental impact is a concern due to poor water solubility and the need for substantial organic solvents. Recently, nano-delivery systems have emerged as a solution, offering a broad range of applications for small molecule compounds. This study introduces a nano-delivery system for Triacontanol (TA), utilizing a star polymer (SPc), aimed at promoting maize growth and improving physiological indicators. The system forms nearly spherical nanoparticles through TA's hydroxyl group and SPc's tertiary amine group. The TA/SPc nano-complex notably outperforms separate TA or SPc treatments in maize, increasing biomass, chlorophyll content, and nutrient absorption. It elevates chlorophyll content by 16.4%, 10.0%, and 6.2% over water, TA, and SPc treatments, respectively, and boosts potassium and nitrate ion uptake by up to 2 and 1.6 times compared to TA alone, leading to enhanced plant height and leaf growth. qRT-PCR analysis further demonstrated that the nano-complex enhanced cellular uptake through the endocytosis pathway by up-regulating endocytosis-related gene expression. The employment of TEM to observe vesicle formation during the internalization of maize leaves furnishes corroborative evidence for the participation of the endocytosis pathway in this process. This research confirms that SPc is an effective carrier for TA, significantly enhancing biological activity and reducing TA dosage requirements. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
