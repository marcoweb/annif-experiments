#ITI#Effect of weed management and fertility levels on productivity of clusterbean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.)Taub]#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during Kharif seasons of 2014 and 2015 at Udaipur (Rajasthan) to find out the effect of weed management on productivity of clusterbean under varying fertility levels. The results revealed that among various weed management practices, two hand weeding 20 and 40 DAS recorded significantly lower weed dry matter, higher weed control efficiency, higher values of yield attributes, seed, haulm and biological yield during both the years over rest of the treatments except sequential application of pendimethalin fb imazethapyr which was statistically at par. Further, application of Imazethapyr fb hand weeding and pendimethalin fb hand weeding also gave comaparable results with pendimethalin fb imazethapyr in terms of weed control efficiency and yields. Among the fertility levels application 20 Kg N + 40 Kg P2O5 ha-1 significantly increased pods plant-1 (24.04), seeds pod-1, (7.12), test weight (25.33 g), seed (1035 kg ha-1), haulm (2161 kg ha-1) and biological (3196 kg ha-1) yield and harvest index (31.98 %) of clusterbean over 10 Kg N + 20 Kg P2O5 ha-1 however, it was found statistically at par with fertility level 30 Kg N + 60 Kg P2O5 ha-1. Therefore, clusterbean should be fertilized with 20 Kg N + 40 Kg P2O5 ha-1 and weeds must be controlled with pendimethalin (PE) fb imazethapyr 0.1 kg ha-1 20 DAS.
