#ITI#Evaluating optimal irrigation for potential yield and economic performance of major crops in southwestern Kansas#FTI#
#IRE#The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer – Cropping System Model was used with an objective to evaluate maize (Zea mays L.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) yield, crop water productivity (CWP) and return after variable cost (RAVC) under different combinations of irrigation interval/capacity and plant available soil water (PASW) thresholds on three soil types in southwestern Kansas. Maize, grain sorghum and winter wheat yields were maximized under irrigation capacity of 4.2–6.3, 3.1–4.2 and 2.5–3.1 mm/d, respectively. The lowest and highest values in the range corresponded to silt loam and fine sand soils, respectively. For maize, maximum RAVC ($630–710/ha) and CWP (25–27 kg/ha/mm) were achieved with a relatively shorter irrigation interval (25 mm/4–8 d). RAVC values for grain sorghum and winter wheat were not substantially affected by irrigation interval. The RAVC for grain sorghum and winter wheat ranged from $150 to $200/ha and $310 to $370/ha, respectively. The CWP of grain sorghum peaked at shorter irrigation interval (25 mm/6–8 d), whereas, high CWP of wheat was simulated even at longer irrigation interval (25 mm/26 d). Overall, for winter wheat and grain sorghum, irrigation strategy for attaining higher RAVC values is different from irrigation strategy for attaining higher yield. Whereas, for maize, irrigation strategy for higher yield is the same as that irrigation strategy for higher RAVC. This study guides producers to identify and prioritize the most suitable irrigation strategy for optimizing yield, CWP and/or income while enhancing sustainability of environment and management of ground water. The present work assumes all factors except water are optimal and findings are sensitive to dynamics of price changes, productivity levels and variations in crop management and climate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
