#ITI#Establishment techniques on yield and economics of pigeon pea [cajanus cajan (L.)] in north western zone of tamil nadu#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were conducted to study the effect of establishment techniques on yield and economics of red gram [Cajanus cajan (L.)] under irrigated condition at Regional Research Station, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Paiyur - 635 112, Tamil Nadu, India during Kharif season of 2013-14 and 2014-15 respectively in randomized block design with four replications. The treatments are line sowing/dibbling of seeds, sowing behind the country plough, sowing in polybag and transplanting at 25 and 40 DAS, sowing in portrays and transplanting in 25 and 40 DAS. The redgram variety LRG 41 was used for study. The results revealed that, dibbling of seeds in lines recorded higher grain yield of 2351 kg ha-1, net income of Rs. 99495/- and B:C ratio of 3.39. Thus, dibbling of seeds in lines recorded 6% higher over sowing in poly bag and transplanting at 25 DAS and 27% higher yield over sowing behind the country plough. Considering yield and economics, line sowing seems to better option for the farmers followed by sowing in polybags and transplanted in 25 DAS. Under transplanted situation, transplanting of seedlings at 30 DAS was more suitable where the monsoon was delayed for 30 to 45 days under rainfed situation.
