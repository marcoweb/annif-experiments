#ITI#Hydropriming accelerates seed germination of Medicago sativa under stressful conditions: A thermal and hydrotime model approach#FTI#
#IRE#This study determined the effects of priming on germination in response to temperature, water potential and NaCl. Thermal and hydrotime models were utilized to evaluate changes in parameters of the model after priming. Priming reduced the amount of thermal time in both cultivars, but slightly increased the base temperature for germination from 1.0 to 3.5°C in “Longdong”. Priming significantly increased germination rate at high water potential but had no effect at low water potential. Further, priming reduced the hydrotime constant but made the median base water potential value slightly more positive in both cultivars. Thus, priming increased germination rate in water but decrease it under severe water stress. Germination rate was significantly increased in both cultivars under salinity (NaCl) stress. Moreover, priming improved seedling growth in response to temperature, water and salinity stress in both cultivars. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
