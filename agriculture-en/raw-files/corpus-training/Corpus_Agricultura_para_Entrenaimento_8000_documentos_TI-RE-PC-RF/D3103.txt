#IRE#A field experiment was conducted at Research Farm of Agricultural Research Station, Swami Keshwanand Rajasthan Agricultural University, Bikaner during three consecutive kharif season of 2013, 2014 and 2015. The experiment comprising ten weeds control treatments consisting of pendamethalin 1000 g/ha (PE), imazethapyr 50g/ha (3-4 leaf stage of crop), imazethapyr 70g/ha (3-4 leaf stage of crop), pendamethalin + imazethapyr 800g/ha (PE), pendamethalin + imazethapyr 900g/ha (PE), pendamethalin + imazethapyr 1000g/ha (PE), imazethapyr + imazamox 60g/ha (3-4 leaf stage of crop), imazethapyr + imazamox 70g/ha (3-4 leaf stage of crop), 2 hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAS and weedy check in randomized block design (RBD) with three replications. Two hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAS was found most effective to control weeds in greengram and recorded lowest weed count and weed dry matter of both broad leaved and grassy weeds. It was also recorded significantly highest branches/pant, leaf area index, total chlorophyll, protein content in seed, pods/plant, seeds/pod and seed, straw and biological yield over other treatments. Among different herbicides, pendamethalin + imazethapyr 800g recorded significantly higher net returns (₹ 31350/ha) and B:C ratio (2.70). © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
