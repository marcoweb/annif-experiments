#ITI#Effect of Different Chickpea Genotypes and Its Biochemical Constituents on Biological Attributes of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the third most important pulse crop grown all over the world. Chickpea is infested by an average of about 60 insect-pests, of which gram pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is known to be the key pest. The migratory nature, polyphagous, short life cycle, multivoltine and resistance to insecticides makes H. armigera very difficult to control. In order to develop the resistance chickpea genotypes against H. armigera it is very important to understand the interrelation between the chickpea biochemical constituents and their effect on insect growth and development. Methods: The biological performance of H. armigera on different chickpea genotypes was studied using detached leaf method and the test genotypes were also evaluated for field level resistance to H. armigera under natural conditions. Different biochemical constituents viz., reducing sugar, protein, total phenol and tannins content in chickpea genotypes were estimated at 30 days after sowing. The relationship between biological attributes of H. armigera reared on different chickpea genotypes and biochemical constituents of chickpea genotypes was computed using simple correlation co-efficient. Result: Among the test genotypes, the lowest larval weight, prolonged larval duration and pupal duration were observed in GL-13042. The lowest pupal weight and percent of adult emergence was observed in NBeG-786 while the lowest fecundity was observed in GL-13001. The per cent pod damage, pest susceptibility/ resistance per cent and PRSR on different chickpea genotypes in the field condition varied from 25.9 to 47.84%, 12.91 to 45.86 and from 4 to 5. In the biochemical constituents, the highest total phenol and tannin content were observed in NBeG-786 whereas the lowest protein and reducing sugar content were observed in GL-13042. Relationship between biological attributes of H. armigera and biochemical constituents in different chickpea genotypes revealed that reducing sugars, protein, total phenols and tannins content showed negative association with biological attributes of H. armigera reared on chickpea genotypes.
