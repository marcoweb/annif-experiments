#ITI#Gamma irradiation used on adult Tetranychus urticae Koch as a quarantine treatment#FTI#
#IRE#The effect of gamma radiation with 0, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, and 450 Gy intensities on the longevity, total number of eggs, and the percent of hatched eggs laid by irradiated females of Tetranychus urticae Koch (Tetranychidae) was evaluated. Two different groups (0-24 h old and 48-72 h old) of adult females were irradiated. The results showed that 350 and 300 Gy doses significantly reduced the longevity of the 0-24 h old females and the 48-72 h old females. The younger females were more tolerant at lower dose rates than the older females. There was a quadratic relationship between dose rates and young females, while it was linear in older females. The total number of eggs laid by females of both ages was significantly reduced with a linear trend by 250 Gy irradiation. The eggs laid by females of both the 0-24 h olds and the 48-72 h olds lost their hatchability when the dose rate was 350 Gy. It was concluded, that applying a dose rate of 320 Gy on one of the mates (male or female) before mating, or a 300 Gy on both of them, would be sufficient to cause sterility in adult mites.#FRE#
