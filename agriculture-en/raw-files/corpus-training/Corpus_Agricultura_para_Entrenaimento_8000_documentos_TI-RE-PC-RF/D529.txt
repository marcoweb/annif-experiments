#ITI#Ethephon promotes isoflavone accumulation in germinating soybeans by its acceleration of isoflavone biosynthetic pathway#FTI#
#IRE#Soybeans have medicinal value and are an oil crop with medicinal and food properties. The present work investigated two aspects of isoflavone accumulation in soybean. First, germination conditions for exogenous-ethephon-mediated accumulation of isoflavone were optimised through response surface methodology. Second, various influences of ethephon on the growth of germinating soybeans and isoflavone metabolism were investigated. The findings of the research led to the conclusion that exogenous ethephon treatment effectively facilitated the enrichment of isoflavones in soybeans during germination. Optimal germination conditions were obtained through a response surface optimization test, which yielded the following criteria: a germination time of 4.2 d, an ethephon concentration of 102.6 μM, and a germination temperature of 30.2 °C. The maximum isoflavone content was 544.53 μg/sprout FW. Relative to the control, the addition of ethephon significantly inhibited sprout growth. Exogenous ethephon treatment led to the phenomenon that peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities and their gene expression increased significantly in germinating soybeans. Meanwhile, the expression of genes related to ethylene synthetase increase under the effect of ethephon promoting ethylene synthesis. Ethylene multiplied the total flavonoid content of soybean sprouts relying on the increase in activity and gene expression of crucial isoflavone biosynthesis-related enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and 4-coumarate coenzyme A ligase) during germination. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
