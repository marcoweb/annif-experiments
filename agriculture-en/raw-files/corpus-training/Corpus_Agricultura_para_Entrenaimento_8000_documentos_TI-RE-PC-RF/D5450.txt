#ITI#A Recombination Event, Induced In Ovo, between a Low Passage Infectious Bronchitis Virus Field Isolate and a Highly Embryo Adapted Vaccine Strain#FTI#
#IRE#The possibility of genomic recombination among different strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was examined in ovo by coinfecting specific pathogen free embryonating chicken eggs with commonly used, embryo-adapted vaccine strains of IBV (Arkansas, Massachusetts, and Connecticut), and a Delaware-072-like field virus isolated from a layer farm in Minnesota. Recombination was observed between the Massachusetts and the Delaware-072-like strains of the virus. The recombination event was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a combination of specific primers designed to flank a known recombination hot spot of the viral genomic sequence that codes for the S1 subunit of the spike envelope protein. The use of these primers allowed the detection of viruses that have undergone recombination around this hot spot. Cloning and sequencing of the RT-PCR product obtained was performed to confirm these results.#FRE#
