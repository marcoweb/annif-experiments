#ITI#Changes in female function and autonomous selfing across floral lifespan interact to drive variation in the cost of selfing#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Morphological and developmental changes as flowers age can impact patterns of mating. At the same time, direct or indirect costs of floral longevity can alter their fitness outcomes. This influence has been less appreciated, particularly with respect to the timing of selfing. We investigated changes in stigma events, autonomous selfing, outcross seed set capacity, and autofertility—a measure representing the potential for reproductive assurance—across floral lifespan in the mixed-mating biennial Sabatia angularis. Methods: We examined stigma morphology and receptivity, autonomous self-pollen deposition, and seed number and size under autonomous self-pollination and hand outcross-pollination for flowers of different ages, from 1 d of female phase until 14 d. We compared autonomous seed production to maximal outcross seed production at each flower age to calculate an index of autofertility. Results: The stigmatic lobes begin to untwist 1 d post anthesis. They progressively open, sextend, coil, and increase in receptivity, peaking or saturating at 8–11 d, depending on the measure. Autonomous seed production can occur early, but on average remains low until 6 d, when it doubles. In contrast, outcross seed number and size start out high, then decline precipitously. Consequently, autofertility increases steeply across floral lifespan. Conclusions: Changes in stigma morphology and receptivity, timing of autonomous self-pollen deposition, and floral senescence can interact to influence the relative benefit of autonomous selfing across floral lifespan. Our work highlights the interplay between evolution of floral longevity and the mating system, with implications for the maintenance of mixed mating in S. angularis. © 2022 The Authors.
