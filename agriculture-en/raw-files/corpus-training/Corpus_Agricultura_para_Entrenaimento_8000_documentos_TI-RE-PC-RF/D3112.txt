#ITI#Stability studies in gum cluster bean genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#Phenotypic stability was studied for seed yield and their component characters in fifty five genotypes of gum cluster bean under four environments during summer and Kharif 2014 at two locations. The environment + (genotypes x environment) was highly significant for all the characters indicating distinct nature of environments and the effects due to environments (linear) was highly significant for all the characters. The partitioning of G x E interaction indicated that the linear components of G x E interaction were significant against pooled deviation for all the traits except number of dry pods per plant and seed yield per hectare and the non linear component (pooled deviation) was also highly significant for all the traits except number of primary branches per plant, number of seeds per dry pod and gum content in seed. Based on stability parameters and over all mean, five genotypes viz., IC-421834, IC-421839, IC-421815, IC-324032, and IC-421798 were stable in performance for seed yield per hectare. The genotypes IC-421830 and IC-421840 were most stable for the gum content in seed. Similarly, the genotypes IC-421830 was found to be stable with respect to protein percentage in seed. The genotypes IC-298638 was found to be stable across environments for higher gum yield per hectare. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
