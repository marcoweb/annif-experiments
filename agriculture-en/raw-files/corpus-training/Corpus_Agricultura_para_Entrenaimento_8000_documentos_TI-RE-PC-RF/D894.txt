#ITI#Accumulation of the bitter substance quercetin mediated by the overexpression of a novel seed-specific gene FtRDE2 in Tartary buckwheat#FTI#
#IRE#Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is frequently employed as a resource to develop health foods, owing to its abundant flavonoids such as rutin. However, the consumption of Tartary buckwheat (TB) is limited in food products due to the strong bitterness induced by the hydrolysis of rutin into quercetin. This transformation is facilitated by the degrading enzyme (RDE). While multiple RDE isoenzymes exist in TB, the superior coding gene of FtRDEs has not been fully explored, which hinders the breeding of TB varieties with minimal bitterness. Here, we found that FtRDE2 is the most abundant enzyme in RDE crude extracts, and its corresponding gene is specifically expressed in TB seeds. Results showed that FtRDE2 has strong rutin hydrolysis activity. Overexpression of FtRDE2 not only significantly promoted rutin hydrolysis and quercetin accumulation but also dramatically upregulated genes involved in the early phase of flavonoid synthesis (FtPAL1、FtC4H1、Ft4CL1, FtCHI1) and anthocyanin metabolism (FtDFR1). These findings elucidate the role of FtRDE2, emphasizing it as an endogenous factor contributing to the bitterness in TB and its involvement in the metabolic regulatory network. Moreover, correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between the catalytic activity of RDE extracts and the expression level of FtRDE2 during seed germination. In summary, our results suggest that FtRDE2 can serve as a promising candidate for the molecular breeding of a TB variety with minimal bitterness. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
