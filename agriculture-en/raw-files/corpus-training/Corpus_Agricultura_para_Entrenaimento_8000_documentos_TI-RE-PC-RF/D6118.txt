#ITI#Comparative genetic structure between Sedum ussuriense and S. kamtschaticum (Crassulaceae), two stonecrops co-occurring on rocky cliffs#FTI#
#IRE#• Premise of the study: Geographic isolation due to discontinuities of suitable habitat may have significant effects on the genetic structure of plant populations. Even within a few kilometers, physical barriers to gene flow may lead to considerable genetic differentiation among populations. • Methods: Sedum ussuriense is a boreal species that in Korea occurs only in four valleys separated by mountain ranges in Juwangsan National Park and its vicinity (a range of ~15 km). Its congener S. kamtschaticum, by contrast, co-occurs in the four valleys but also on the intervening mountains. Using 12 allozyme loci, we comparatively assessed genetic variability and structure in 12 population pairs of the two stonecrops. • Key results: While we found high and comparable levels of within-population genetic variation for the two species, among-population divergence was significantly higher in S. ussuriense (FST = 0.261 vs. FST = 0.165). Sedum ussuriense also showed a much higher percentage of among-valley variation (19%) than S. kamtschaticum (4%). • Conclusions: High levels of genetic diversity in the two Sedum species are consistent with the previous hypothesis that mountains of the Korean Peninsula served as glacial refugia for many boreal species. Given that the two congeners have similar life-history traits, the lower among-population differentiation in S. kamtschaticum is attributable to its higher abundance and more continuous distribution in the study area. This study confirms the central role of geographic isolation in the genetic structure of plant species even at very small scales. © 2014 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
