#ITI#Comparative study to determine food consumption of cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis, on some cotton genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#A study was done on the feeding behaviour, development indices, and biochemical response of 4th instar larvae of Spodoptera littoralis in which seven cotton genotypes were used: Giza86, Giza88, Giza92, 10229 × Giza 86, H10, Suvin, and Karshenseki. Castor bean leaves were used as the control. All the tested cotton genotypes decreased the feeding behavior of S. littoralis larvae in terms of consumption percentages, consumption rate (CR), growth rates (GR), efficiency of conversion of ingested and digested food (ECI and ECD), approximate digestibility (AD), and feeding deterrence (FDI) compared to the control. Additionally, all the tested cotton varieties prolonged the time taken for larval and pupal duration and reduced both the pupation percentages and the weight of the resulting pupae, as compared to the control. Giza86 recorded the lowest values of both larval growth index and fitness (7.31 and 1.05, respectively) while the genotype Suvin recorded the lowest standardised growth index (0.020) more than other genotypes and the control that gave 10.16, 1.53, and 0.032, respectively. There was a significant inhibition in the level of both total soluble protein and total lipids, and activities of amylase and the trehalase enzymes in all the tested varieties, compared to that found in the control. © Mohamad Ahmad Khedr et al. 2015.#FRE#
