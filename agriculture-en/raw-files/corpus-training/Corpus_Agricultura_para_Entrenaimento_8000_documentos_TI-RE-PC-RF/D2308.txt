#ITI#Nutrient recycling potential of Tephrosia candida in cropping systems of southeastern Nigeria#FTI#
#IRE#Improving fallow quality in cassava-fallow rotations in southeastern Nigeria through the use of leguminous cover crops has been shown to sustain the productivity of such systems. We studied the effects of age (1 or 2 years) of Tephrosia candida fallow on biomass and nutrient accumulation, on weed biomass and yield response of cassava/maize intercrop and on changes in soil chemical properties in a 3 yr field trial. Results were compared with those obtained in natural fallow. Total biomass and litter were three times higher in plots fallowed for 2 yr with Tephrosia candida than in those under natural fallow for the same period. Weed biomass was 205% lower in T. candida plots fallowed for 2 yr than in the natural fallow and was 174% smaller in T. candida plots fallow for 1 yr than in the natural fallow. Nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and potassium) yields in leaves of T. candida fallow for 2 yr were on average 200-300% higher than in leaves of other fallows. The same trend was observed for cassava and maize yields. Soil chemical changes at soil depth 0 to 5 cm showed significant increases in N and C concentrations after 2 yr fallowing and a year of cropping, particularly in the planted fallow plots. Conversely, soil pH, available P and the exchangeable cations, especially Ca were lower, while Al was higher than the initial values, mainly in plots fallowed under T. candida, indicating a tendency of this fallow species to further exacerbate the soil acidification problem of the acid Ultisol at the study site in southeastern Nigeria.#FRE#
