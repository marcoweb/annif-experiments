#ITI#Performance and oocyst shedding in broiler chickens orally infected with Cryptosporidium baileyi and Cryptosporidium meleagridis#FTI#
#IRE#To study effects of experimental cryptosporidiosis, broiler chickens were infected per os with 5 × 105 oocysts of Cryptosporidium baileyi and Cryptosporidium meleagridis. In the first experiment, chickens were infected with oocysts of C. baileyi at the age of 7, 14, and 21 days. In the second experiment, chickens were infected with oocysts of C. baileyi, C. meleagridis, or both cryptosporidial species at the age of 7 days. Although clinical signs of infection were apparent, neither final live weight nor mortality was significanty influenced in chickens infected with a single Cryptosporidium species. In chickens infected with C. meleagridis, the growth retardation was observed in the 2-wk period after infection. The compensatory growth, however, started when the oocyst shedding had ceased. The number of oocysts in excreta specimens of chickens infected with C. meleagridis was two to three times lower than in excreta of chickens infected with C. baileyi. Chickens infected with both C. baileyi and C. meleagridis (5 × 105 oocysts of each) had significantly lower final live weight and worse feed efficiency than chickens of other groups. Concurrent infection did not influence individual C. baileyi or C. meleagridis oocyst shedding.#FRE#
