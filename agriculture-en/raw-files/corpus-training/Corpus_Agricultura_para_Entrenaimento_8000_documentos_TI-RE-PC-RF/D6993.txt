#ITI#Evaluating water-energy-food system of Yellow River basin based on type-2 fuzzy sets and Pressure-State-Response model#FTI#
#IRE#Water, energy and food security are the prerequisites for coping with intensified climate change, and also the guarantee for sustaining socio-economic development. This study aims to establish a “Pressure-State-Response” (PSR) model to evaluate the water-energy-food (WEF) system security and clarify the main factors affecting WEF development, system state and social response. In addition, the interval type-2 fuzzy sets and analytic hierarchy process are incorporated to address uncertainty in the importance weights of quantitative indicators. Scenario design, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and Combinative Distance-based Asssessment (CODAS) methods are also adopted to carry out quantitative calculation and explore the key constraints of WEF system security in the nine provinces of the Yellow River basin from 2006 to 2019. Results show that the WEF system security in each province has been improved in 2006–2019 under different scenarios. In detail, the pressure of WEF system is decreasing in Gansu, Ningxia, and Shanxi province, which is due to the decrease in waste water emissions per person and energy consumption per unit of GDP. The state of WEF system in various provinces has also been improved year by year. The response of WEF system is increasing in all provinces except Shanxi. There is obvious spatial-temporal heterogeneity in different provinces, but the regional gaps are narrowing. These findings cannot only reflect the multi-element relationship from both human activities and environmental changes, but also deal with uncertain in WEF assessment system. The obtained results can provide scientific basis for decision-makers to formulate relevant policies and measures. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
