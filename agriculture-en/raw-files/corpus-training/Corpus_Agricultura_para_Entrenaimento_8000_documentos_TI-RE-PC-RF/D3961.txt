#ITI#Hatchery spray cabinet administration does not damage avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus vaccine based on analysis by electron microscopy and virus titration#FTI#
#IRE#Previous studies in our laboratory showed that the Arkansas-Delmarva Poultry Industry (Ark-DPI) vaccine given to 1-day-old chickens by hatchery spray cabinet replicated poorly and failed to adequately protect broilers against homologous virus challenge, whereas the same vaccine given by eye-drop did replicate and the birds were protected following homologous virus challenge. To determine if mechanical damage following spray application plays a role in failure of the Ark-DPI vaccine, we examined the morphology of three Ark-DPI vaccines from different manufacturers using an electron microscope and included a Massachusetts (Mass) vaccine as control. One of the Ark-DPI vaccines (vaccine A) and the Mass vaccine had significantly (P < 0.005) fewer spikes than the other two Ark-DPI vaccines. We also found that the Ark-DPI and Mass vaccines had significantly (P < 0.005) fewer spike proteins per virus particle when compared to their respective challenge viruses. This observation is interesting and may provide some insight into the mechanism behind infectious bronchitis virus attenuation. No obvious differences were observed in virus morphology and no consistent trend in the number of spikes per virion was found in before-and after-spray samples. We also determined the vaccine titer before and after spray in embryonated eggs and found that both Ark-DPI and Mass vaccines had a similar drop in titer, 0.40 log10 and 0.36 log10, respectively. Based on these data, it appears that mechanical damage to the Ark-DPI vaccine is not occurring when delivered by a hatchery spray cabinet, suggesting that some other factor is contributing to the failure of that vaccine when given by that method.
