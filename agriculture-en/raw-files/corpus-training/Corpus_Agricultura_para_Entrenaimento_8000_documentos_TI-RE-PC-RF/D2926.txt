#ITI#Influence of zypmite on productivity and nutrient uptake of chickpea (Cicer arietinum l.) crop under rainfed condition Chhattisgarh plain region#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of Zypmite fertilizer along with di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) in study. The application of Zypmite exhibited in growth, yield, nutrients uptake and availability of nutrient in soil. Zypmite response, the maximum number of branches (25.8 p-1), test weight (18.5 gm) and grain yield (17.10 q ha-1) was observed with 50 kg P2O5 through DAP + 40 kg S through Zypmite (T6). The nitrogen (69.52 kg ha-1) and phosphorous (7.89 kg ha-1) uptake was also found maximum under T6 and minimum in control (T1). The potassium (39.27 kg ha-1) and sulphur (7.85 kg ha-1) uptake was observed maximum under 50 kg P2O5 through DAP + 20 kg S through Zypmite (T5). After harvesting of crop, available nutrient status was observed higher available nitrogen (243.0 kg ha-1) under T6 and available phosphorous was significantly higher in T2 and T9 (18.0 kg ha-1) as compared to control. Availability of potassium in all treatments was significantly not influenced during both years. The sulphur availability in soil was significantly influenced among treatment and found maximum (23.0 kg ha-1) under 40 kg sulphur through Zypmite (T7). It was observed that Zypmite and chemical fertilizers, enhanced yield and higher uptake of nutrient as well as improved soil fertility. Â© 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
