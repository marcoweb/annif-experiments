#ITI#Optimization of winter irrigation management for salinized farmland using a coupled model of soil water flow and crop growth#FTI#
#IRE#Drip irrigation under film mulch (DIUFM) and subsurface pipe drainage (SPD) are important measures to cope with water shortages and soil salinization in arid areas of northwest China. To investigate the coordinated operation mode of DIUFM and SPD, a new H2DSWAP model was developed based on coupling the HYDRUS-2D with a Soil–Water–Atmosphere–Plant model (SWAP). In the H2DSWAP model, real-time evapotranspiration, simple root growth, and the interaction between crops and soil water and salt are considered to improve the simulation accuracy. The model was calibrated and validated using parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis software (PEST) using field experiment datasets in 2019 and 2020 respectively. Compared with the original HYDRUS-2D model, the simulation accuracy of the H2DSWAP for soil water (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.011 cm3·cm−3; mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.008 cm3·cm−3; determinant coefficient (R2) = 0.869) and soil salt (RMSE = 0.296 g·kg−1; MAE = 0.231 g·kg−1; R2 = 0.959) contents has been greatly improved. In addition, the simulation of the leaf area index (LAI) and yield also fitted well with field observations. The calibrated model was used to predict salt transport at depths of 0–100 cm and the change in maize yield under DIUFM. The results indicated that maize yield decreased yearly, and soil salinity increased yearly under DIUFM without SPD. Based on the obtained results, the management strategies of winter irrigation (WIR) under different drip irrigation water amounts, namely 600 mm (S1), 540 mm (S2), 480 mm (S3), and 420 mm (S4), were further investigated. Water productivity (WP) and yield were used as evaluation indices. The WIR was carried out every 4–5 years when the drip irrigation amount of the maize field was S1 and S2 was recommended. However, it was recommended to carry out WIR every 2 and 3 years under S3 and S4, respectively. Overall, the H2DSWAP model can be used as a useful tool to guide the operation mode of drip irrigation under mulch and subsurface pipe drainage in saline soils. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
