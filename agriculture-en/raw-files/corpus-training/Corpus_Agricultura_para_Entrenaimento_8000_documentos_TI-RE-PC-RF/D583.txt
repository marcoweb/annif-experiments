#ITI#Valorization of different low-grade date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) fruit varieties: A study on the bioactive properties of polyphenolic extracts and their stability upon in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion#FTI#
#IRE#Nowadays, the development of suitable strategies for the management and valorization of agri-food products is one of the most important challenges worldwide. In this context, the current research study aimed to explore a valorization strategy for different varieties (Khalas, Jabri, Lulu, Booman, and Sayer) of low-grade date fruit by extracting polyphenolic compounds and investigating their health-promoting bioactive properties. The generated extracts were comparatively analyzed for their phenolic contents, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-hemolytic, and enzyme inhibitory activities upon in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID). The total phenolic contents (TPC) ranged from 217.3 to 1846.9 mg GAE/100 g fresh weight. After complete SGID, the TPC remarkably increased from 570.8 mg GAE/100 g fresh weight (undigested), reaching the highest value of 1606.3 mg GAE/100 g fresh weight with the Khalas cultivar. Overall, gastric and complete-SGID-treated extracts exhibited higher antioxidant activities, compared to the undigested extracts for the five selected date varieties. Similarly, the gastric and complete SGID promoted the release of bioactive components endowed with significantly higher inhibition levels towards digestive enzymes related to diabetes. Moreover, extracts from all varieties revealed an increase in the inhibition of lipidemic-related enzymatic markers and anti-inflammatory activities when subjected to the gastric digestion phase, which decreased after complete SGID. Principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that higher bioactive properties were influenced by the TPC present in the samples. Overall, low-quality dates could be considered as a potential source of bioactive polyphenols with interesting nutraceutical properties, released upon their transit through the gastrointestinal tract. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
