#ITI#The role of penicillin G potassium in managing Clostridium perfringens in broiler chickens#FTI#
#IRE#The efficacy of penicillin G potassium (Pot-Pen) administered via drinking water to manage necrotic enteritis (NE) was investigated in a Clostridium perfringens (CP) challenge study using 1600 broiler chickens assigned to one of four treatment groups: nonchallenged, nonmedicated; challenged, nonmedicated; challenged, Pot-Pen 0.2 g/L; challenged, Pot-Pen 0.4 g/L. Overall mortality due to NE was significantly reduced among Pot-Pen-treated pens; mortality due to other causes did not differ among the treatment groups. Among all birds, growth performance parameters were significantly improved among Pot-Pen-treated pens. When considering birds randomly sacrificed 4 days post-Pot-Pen initiation, mean NE lesion scores were greatest among the challenged, nonmedicated pens; only one of 80 randomly sacrificed birds treated with Pot-Pen had NE lesions. Among the nonmedicated control pens, body weight (BW) was significantly greater among birds that did not have NE-associated lesions. When sacrificed birds were stratified by NE lesion score, there were no significant differences in BW among the treatment groups. Results of this study suggest that CP-associated subclinical disease can significantly reduce broiler performance. Furthermore, the positive effects of treatment with Pot-Pen appeared to be associated with the prevention and/or treatment of NE-specific lesions.#FRE#
