#ITI#Carbon isotope discrimination and water use efficiency in interspecific Prunus hybrids subjected to drought stress#FTI#
#IRE#In C3 plants, carbon isotope composition (δ13C) is influenced by isotopic effects during diffusion from the atmosphere to the chloroplasts and carboxylation reactions. This work aimed to demonstrate if δ13C of leaf soluble carbohydrates (δ13Cleaves) and of dry matter from new-growth shoots (δ13Cshoots) of Prunus plants subjected to a period of water deficit was related to water use efficiency (WUE). For this purpose, three interspecific Prunus hybrids rootstocks (6–5, 7-7 and G × N) were gradually subjected to drought and then rewatered. Soil water content (SWC) decreased from 26.1 to 9.4% after 70 days of water shortage, when plants reached values of predawn leaf water potential (LWP) ranging from −3.12 to −4.00 MPa. Gas exchange, particularly net photosynthetic and transpiration rates, differed among the three hybrids, leading to different values of WUE. After 70 days of drought, a significant δ13C increase of 5.86, 4.28 and 4.99‰ was observed in 6–5, 7-7 and G × N, respectively. Significant correlations between δ13C and other parameters (substomatal CO2/atmospheric CO2 ratio, stomatal conductance and stem water potential) were found in all hybrids. The rewatering phase caused a recovery of the physiological status of the plants. The isotope composition of δ13Cshoots was correlated with the average WUE measured during the whole experiment. δ13Cleaves and δ13Cshoots were positively related (r = 0.87; p < 0.001). The isotopic signature was a reliable screening tool to identify Prunus genotypes tolerant to drought stress. The results suggest the possibility of using δ13C as an integrated indicator of level of drought stress in plants subjected to prolonged stress conditions. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
