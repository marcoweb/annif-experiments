#ITI#Recent increase of Marek's Disease in Korea related to the virulence increase of the virus#FTI#
#IRE#The incidence of Marek's disease (MD), an important neoplastic disease of chickens, suddenly increased in 1997 in Korea. Most MD cases of this country were detected in chickens over 20 wk of age. Five MD viruses were isolated from field flocks in which severe MD losses had occurred, and one of the viruses was studied to compare its pathotype with the prototype JM strain. The isolate KOMD-IC induced severe depression not only in body weight but also in relative bursal weight, and the depression by KOMD-IC was more severe than that induced by JM strain. In addition, the incidence of MD tumor caused by KOMD-IC was higher than that caused by the JM strain. The protective capacity of several MD vaccines was studied against challenge with KOMD-IC. The protective levels of several MD vaccines such as herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT), HVT plus SB1, and Rispens were usually lower against challenge with KOMD-IC than those challenged with JM strain, even if the chickens vaccinated with serotype 1 were not completely protected against challenge with KOMD-IC. The above results indicate that the virulence of KOMD-IC isolated recently was increased, and the increase of MD outbreak in Korea may be related to the virulence increase of the virus. Various MD vaccine programs were applied to reduce MD loss to a broiler breeder farm where severe MD loss had occurred. Serotype 1 vaccine could dramatically decrease the mortality due to MD, and the best results were obtained from the flocks vaccinated with bivalent vaccine of Rispens and HVT.#FRE#
