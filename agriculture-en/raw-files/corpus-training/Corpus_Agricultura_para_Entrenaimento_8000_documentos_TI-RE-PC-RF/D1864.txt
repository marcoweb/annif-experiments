#ITI#The combined effect of fertiliser nitrogen and phosphorus on herbage yield and changes in soil nutrients of a grass/clover and grass-only sward#FTI#
#IRE#The combined effect of reduced nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) application on the production of grass-only and grass/clover swards was studied in a five-year cutting experiment on a marine clay soil, established on newly sown swards. Furthermore, changes in soil N, P and carbon (C) were measured. Treatments included four P (0, 35, 70 and 105 kg P ha-1 year -1) and three N levels (0, 190 and 380 N kg ha-1 year -1) and two sward types (grass-only and grass/clover). Nitrogen was the main factor determining the yield and quality of the harvested herbage. On the grass-only swards, N application increased the DM yield with 28 or 22 kg DM kg N-1, at 190 or 380 kg N ha-1 year-1, respectively. The average apparent N recovery was 0.78 kg kg-1. On the grass/clover swards, N application of 190 ha-1 year-1 increased grass production at the cost of white clover, which decreased from 41 to 16%. Phosphorus application increased grass yields, but did not increase clover yields. A positive interaction between N and P applications was observed. However, the consequences of this interaction for the optimal N application were only minor, and of little practical relevance. Both the P-AL-value and total soil P showed a positive response to P application and a negative response to N application. Furthermore, the positive effect of P application decreased with increasing N application. The annual changes in P-AL-value and total soil P were closely related to the soil surface surplus, which in turn was determined by the level of N and P application and their interaction. The accumulation of soil N was similar on both sward types, but within the grass-only swards soil N was positively affected by N application. The accumulation of organic C was unaffected by N or P application, but was lower under grass/clover than under grass-only.#FRE#
