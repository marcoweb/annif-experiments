#ITI#Water and nitrogen interaction on soil profile water extraction and ET in maize-wheat cropping system#FTI#
#IRE#In the present study, water and nitrogen interaction on soil profile water extraction and evapo-transpiration (ET) was investigated taking a field experiment on a clay loam soil (Typic Haplustept) at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi with four consecutive crops (maize-wheat-maize-wheat) taken from July 2002 to April 2004. Three levels of water regime, namely W1, W2 and W3 referring to limited, medium and maximum irrigation were applied to each crop depending on the seasonal rainfall and the critical crop growth stage. The three water regimes were used with five nitrogen levels from T1 to T5, (T1, 0% N; T2, 75% N; T3, 100% N; T4, 150% N; T5, 100% N from organic source) in a split plot design for the four crops grown in sequence. Significant water and nitrogen interaction was observed for ET and soil profile water extraction pattern. Averaged across nitrogen treatments, ET in W2 and W3 were higher by 17 and 26%, respectively than W1 in maize 2002 and by 12 and 19% in maize 2003. In case of wheat, ET in W2 and W3 were higher by 27 and 58% than W1 in 1st crop and by 37 and 70% in 2nd crop. The effect of nitrogen regime, however, was prominent in both crops of maize and wheat, with significantly higher profile soil moisture depletion in T4 of each water regime. In all cases, lowest water depletion was observed in control plots receiving 0% N. In both crops, water extraction from surface 60 cm was highest in W3 followed by W2 and W1. In maize, the % extraction from 0 to 60 cm layer varied from 71 to 76% (W1), 70-79% (W2) and 75-82% (W3), whereas the values for wheat were 70-77, 72-79 and 75-83% for W1, W2 and W3, respectively. The 90-120 cm layer contributed only 3-14% to total water extraction in both the crops. From 90 to 120 cm layer, higher extraction was observed in W1 as compared to W3. The extraction values in W1, W2 and W3 in maize were 9-13, 7-14 and 3-9, respectively, whereas the corresponding values in wheat were 8-14, 5-12 and 3-7% for the three water regimes. Effect of nitrogen treatments on water extraction from deeper layer was observed with higher extraction in highest fertilized treatment (T4) as compared to other treatments. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.
