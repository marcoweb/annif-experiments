#ITI#Remnants of populations provide effective source material for reintroduction of an endangered Hawaiian plant, Schiedea kaalae (Caryophyllaceae)#FTI#
#IRE#• Premise of the study: Reintroductions may be essential to prevent extinction of many critically endangered species. Ideally, reintroduction efforts rely on adjacent source populations, but limited source material may necessitate crossing individuals from different and possibly distant populations. To determine the consequences of integrating multiple populations in reintroductions, we investigated levels of inbreeding depression, outbreeding depression, and heterosis for populations of Schiedea kaalae (Caryophyllaceae), an endangered species endemic to the Wai‘anae and Ko‘olau Mountains of O‘ahu, Hawai‘i. The possibility of gene flow among plants was explored through pollinator observations.#FRE#
