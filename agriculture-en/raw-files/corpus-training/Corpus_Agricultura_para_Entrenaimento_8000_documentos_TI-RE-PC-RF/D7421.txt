#ITI#A practical surface irrigation system design based on volume balance model and multi-objective evolutionary optimization algorithms#FTI#
#IRE#Agriculture has always been considered as an important source of food supply, and the optimal use of its resources, specially water, for productive agriculture has been given especial attention. In this paper a simulation-optimization model based on the volume balance model for designing an efficient and practical irrigation system is presented. The proposed model uses the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for optimizing design parameters of different irrigation systems, furrow, border and basin. Using appropriate constraints and applying performance indicators in first and subsequent irrigations, practical and theoretical optimal designs are obtained. The proposed model achieves a more practical design using three novel approaches. First, simultaneously considering the performance indicators of the first and subsequent irrigations. Second, using both total time required for irrigation and inflow rate of the field. Third, considering the labor required to implement the obtained design. In this study, the proposed model was evaluated performing several experiments on 16 fields. To get better results, an evolutionary method called MetaGA is used to properly tune the parameters of the simulation-optimization model. Results of the simulation stage of the proposed model were compared with results of two simulation software in the irrigation systems, SIRMOD and SURDEV and the simulation stage was validated. Results of the proposed model were evaluated using the results of two other models, EDOSIM and multi-objective, in 16 fields, based on 5 performance indicators. The results of this study reveal that the proposed model in most fields and indicators achieves better results and the results are close in the others. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
