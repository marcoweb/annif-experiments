#ITI#Development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the measurement of antibodies against infectious coryza vaccine#FTI#
#IRE#Infectious coryza is an acute respiratory disease caused by infection with Avibacterium (Haemophilus) paragallinarum. It is characterized by nasal discharge and facial swelling and is associated with growth retardation and a reduction in egg production. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests are used to estimate vaccine-induced immunity against infectious coryza in vitro; however, these procedures are complicated and their sensitivity is insufficient. To address these problems, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique using serovar-specific regions of HMTp210 (210 kDa), an outer-membrane protein of A. paragallinarum, was developed to measure the antibodies against infectious coryza. Chickens with an ELISA titer of 0.3 or more did not exhibit clinical signs of infectious coryza against challenge with A. paragallinarum, although their HI antibody titers were negative. On the other hand, chickens with an ELISA titer below 0.3 exhibited clinical signs of the disease with one exception. Antibody prevalence rates on ELISA were 80% and 60% against infection with serovars A and C, respectively, and ELISA also detected antibodies in chickens infected with A. paragallinarum with a sensitivity higher than that of HI tests. Taken together, the ELISA technique developed in this study is a valuable tool for the measurement of antibodies produced against the infectious coryza vaccine or in response to an infection with A. paragallinarum.
