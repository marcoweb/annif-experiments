#ITI#Influence of locations under same climatic zone on some common vetch lines (Vicia sativa L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Two experiments each following randomized complete block design with three replications were conducted simultaneously in Antalya and Adana locations in 2015-2016 growing season with 9 different common vetch lines and 3 cultivars to compare their yield and quality performance with respect to 17 different characters and also to find the relationships between them. The results revealed that interlocational difference of mean values for the characters were more pronounced than those within location. From yield and quality parameters investigated in this study significant differences could be noticed for the morphological characters at large and a for a few of the quality characters. Although no line could be identified to be superior for a good number of characters, line 2 has been recognized to be superior. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
