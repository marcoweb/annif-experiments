#ITI#The effects of olive wastewater on the early growth of fababean and Rhizobium nodulation#FTI#
#IRE#Olive processing waste (OPW) is a by-product of olive oil production. Most of the studies about olive processing waste are carried-out in cotton, sunflower, wheat etc. However, there is little research performed on the effects of OPW on legumes. Therefore, the effect of OPW on growth of fababean and Rhizobium bacteria was studied in this research. It was used in doses of 0 (control), 18, 30 and 42 grams per pot, which is equivalent to doses of 3, 5 and 7 kg m-2. Increasing concentration of OPW improved the root fresh weight, nodule area, nodule diameter, root nodules scale value and the number of Rhizobium in one gram nodules. The results showed that the optimum OPW dose was 30 g pot-1 according to plant growth, nodules and Rhizobium. It was concluded that the OPW concentrations of 3% and it’s below can be used for fababean growing. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
