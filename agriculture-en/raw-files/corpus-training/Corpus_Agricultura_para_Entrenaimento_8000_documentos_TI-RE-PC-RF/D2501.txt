#ITI#Genetic divergence, variability and correlation studies in black gram [vigna mungo (L.) hepper]#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted to estimate genetic divergence, variability and correlation in 104 black gram genotypes for nine quantitative characters. Genetic diversity using Mahalanobis D2 technique was studied for yield and yield contributing traits. Out of eight clusters, high inter cluster distance was recorded between clusters VI and VIII. Cluster V had low mean value for days to 50% flowering and cluster VII had high mean value for plant height, number of primary branches per plant and number of seeds per plant. The genotypes present in these clusters could be utilized for hybridization programmes. High heritability coupled with GAM was observed for plant height, number of primary branches per plant, number of clusters per plant, number of pods per plant and single plant yield. From the association analysis, single plant yield had positive and significant association with plant height and number of primary branches per plant. Hence, simultaneous selection of the above traits would be more rewarding to bring genetic improvement in black gram breeding programmes. Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
