#ITI#N2O emissions from grain cropping systems: a meta-analysis of the impacts of fertilizer-based and ecologically-based nutrient management strategies#FTI#
#IRE#Understanding how agricultural management practices impact nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions is prerequisite for developing mitigation protocols. We conducted a meta-analysis on 597 pairwise comparisons (129 papers) to assess how management affects N2O emissions. Pairwise comparisons of practices aimed at improving fertilizer use efficiency (39%) and tillage (30%) dominated the dataset, while ecologically-based nutrient management (ENM) practices constituted 15% of the pairs. In general, across management practices, the quantity of N added was a more significant driver of N2O fluxes than was the form of N (fertilizer, legume biomass or animal manures). Manure interacted with soil texture so that in coarse soils, N2O emissions from manures tended to be higher compared to inorganic N fertilizers. The studies of ENM strategies frequently involved over-application of N inputs in the ENM treatments. Cover crops reduced N2O emissions compared to bare fallows. However, during the cash crop growing season, when differences in N added and N source were confounded, the extra N inputs from cover crops were significantly correlated with the differences in N2O emissions between treatments with and without cover crops. Overall, in 38% of the data pairs, N2O emissions were reduced with limited impacts on yields; in half of these pairs, yields were maintained or increased while in the other half they were reduced by only ≤10%. Knowledge gaps on mitigation of agricultural N2O emissions could be addressed by applying an ecosystem-based, cross-scale perspective in conjunction with the N saturation conceptual framework to guide research priorities and experimental designs. © 2017, The Author(s).#FRE#
