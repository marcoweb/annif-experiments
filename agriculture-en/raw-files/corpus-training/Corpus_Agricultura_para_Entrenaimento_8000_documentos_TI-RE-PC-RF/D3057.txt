#ITI#Effect of moisture content on biophysical characteristics of chickpea cultivars#FTI#
#IRE#In order to study the effect of moisture on biophysical characteristics of different chickpea cultivars, a factorial experiment was conducted with two factors in a completely randomized block design. Factors included chickpea cultivars (Bionij, Azad and Hashem) and humidity at 4 levels (15%, 20%, 25% and 30%). This study was done with 50 repetitions in Gonbad-e Kavous University in 2013. Measured characteristics were length, width, thickness, geometric diameter, sphericity coefficient, volume and the coefficient of static friction. Results showed that, there are significant differences between the chickpea cultivars at all moisture levels for all studied characteristics. Also significant difference was found between moisture levels in different cultivars among all characteristics (except sphericity coefficient). Mean comparison of traits showed that, the highest amount of geometric diameter, the highest volume and maximum sphericity coefficient in different cultivars related to moisture content of 30%, 20% and 20% respectively. With increasing moisture, all measured parameters increased except sphericity coefficient. In addition Hashem cultivar is strongly influenced by increasing moisture in terms of grain volume and the geometric diameter. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
