#ITI#Oat catch crop efficacy on nitrogen leaching varies after forage crop grazing#FTI#
#IRE#This study tested the effect of oat catch crops on mineral nitrogen (N) leaching losses from cool season fodder beet grazing. Undisturbed soil monolith lysimeters were collected from two grassland sites with soils featuring contrasting texture and water holding capacity (WHC) characteristics. After simulated fodder beet grazing in late autumn or winter, synthetic dairy cow urine was applied. Nitrogen leaching losses were measured from lysimeters sown with oats after urine application and compared with those under fallow conditions until spring. Oat dry matter (DM) production and N uptake measurements were obtained. Sowing oats reduced total mineral N leaching losses by up to 59%. Reductions in mineral N leaching were inconsistently affected by soil type but were strongly influenced by urine application timing. Nitrogen uptake by oats (52–143 kg N ha−1) drove reductions in N leaching losses compared with fallow soil. Oats yielded 4–17 t DM ha−1, and both yield and N uptake were strongly affected by urine application timing (winter > autumn) and soil type (high WHC > low WHC). Sowing oats after fodder beet grazing instead of leaving the ground fallow can reduce the environmental impacts of these systems, while simultaneously increasing annual feed supply. Catch crop gains can be maximised by avoiding or delaying autumn grazing of fodder beet, particularly on low WHC soils. © 2022, The Author(s).#FRE#
