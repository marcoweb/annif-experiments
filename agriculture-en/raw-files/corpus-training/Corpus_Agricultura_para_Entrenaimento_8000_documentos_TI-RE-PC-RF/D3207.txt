#ITI#Effect of genotypes and phosphorus levels on growth analysis parameters of greengram (Vigna rediata L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were conducted at RVSKVV – College Research Farm, Gwalior (M.P.) during two kharif and summer seasons of 2009 and 2010 to study the effect of genotypes and phosphorus levels on growth parameters of greengram (Vigna radiate L.). The LAI, LAR, LAD, NAR, CGR and RGR increased upto 60 DAS and the n decreased due to senescence and aging of leaves. On the average of two years data, the verities and phosphorus levels exerted significant impact upon these parameters at every stage of observation. Amongst the genotypes, TM 99-50 and amongst phosphorus levels, 60 kg P2O5/ha recorded almost significantly higher growth analysis parameters at both the stages and both the seasons (kharif and summer). The second best genotype was TM 98-50 and second best phosphorus level was 30 kg P2O5/ha to augment these parameters. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
