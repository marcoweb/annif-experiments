#ITI#Analysis of DNA methylation in potato tuber in response to light exposure during storage#FTI#
#IRE#Exposure to light induces tuber greening and the accumulation of the toxic alkaloid Solanine in potato (Solanum tuberosum L) during storage greatly reduce tuber value. While the mechanism of this greening process remains unclear, it is well understood that DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression in response to environmental conditions. In this study, methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism was used to assess the effect of light exposure on DNA methylation during storage of potato tubers. Light-induced genome-wide DNA demethylation and the rate of DNA methylation decreased with long storage times. Following, the sequencing of 14 differentially amplified fragments and analysis using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, eight genomic sequences and six annotated fragment sequences were identified. The latter included ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase 1/2, chlorophyllide a oxygenase 1 (CAO1), receptor-like protein kinase HAIKU2, and repressor of GA4, all of which are involved in starch biosynthesis, chlorophyll synthesis, endosperm development, and gibberellic acid signaling, respectively. Demethylation was observed in the CpG island (−273 to −166 bp) of the CAO1 promoter in response to light, which further confirmed that the variations in genome methylation are dependent upon the light exposure and suggests a direct role for DNA methylation. Our results provide an epigenetic perspective for further exploring the mechanism of light-induced tuber greening. © 2021#FRE#
