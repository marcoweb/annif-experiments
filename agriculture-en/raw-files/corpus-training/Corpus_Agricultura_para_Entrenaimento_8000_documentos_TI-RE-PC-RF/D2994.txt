#ITI#Effect of Callosobruchus chinensis on seed quality parameters of horse gram accessions during storage#FTI#
#IRE#Studies on the effect of pulse beetle (Callosobruchus chinensis L.) on seed quality parameters of horse gram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) accessions was undertaken at Seed Research and Technology Centre, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad during 2011-12. Seed germination, seedling length and seedling vigor indices-I and II in 50 accessions of horse gram were estimated both at initial as well at 60 days after infestation and they were screened for their relative response to the attack by C. chinensis with artificial infestation. Significant difference between accessions was observed with regard to their relative susceptibility to bruchid infestation. The per cent reduction in germination in comparison to initial germination was 0.4%, 2.4% and 2.4% for Palem-1, Palem-2 and AK-21, respectively at 60 days after release whereas in NS/05/42, per cent germination drastically reduced from 90.6 to 31.6% leading to 65% reduction in germination after infestation.
