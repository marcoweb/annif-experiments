#ITI#Effect of organic seed pelleting on seedling quality, gas exchange, growth, yield and resultant seed quality parameters of black gram#FTI#
#IRE#Seed pelleting with leaf powders of two botanicals viz., pungam (Pongamia glabra) and prosopis (Prosopis juliflora) was done to study the effect of botanical seed pelleting on seedling quality, gas exchange, growth, yield and resultant seed quality parameters of black gram in the laboratory and field. From the results, it was found that, seeds pelleted with pungam leaf powder @ 150 g kg≤1 recorded higher germination percentage (93.00), root length (18.35 cm), shoot length (19.34 cm), dry matter production (0.48 mg seedling≤10) and vigour index (3505.10). The yield parameters such as pod length, number of pods plant≤1, pod yield plant≤1, number of seeds pod≤1 and 100 seed weight were also found higher in pungam leaf powder pelleting treatment @ 150 g kg≤1. The control recorded the least values in all these growth and yield parameters of black gram. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
