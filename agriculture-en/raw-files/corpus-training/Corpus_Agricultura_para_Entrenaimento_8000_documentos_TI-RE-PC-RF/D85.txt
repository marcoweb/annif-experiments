#ITI#Exogenous spermidine regulates the anaerobic enzyme system through hormone concentrations and related-gene expression in Phyllostachys praecox roots under flooding stress#FTI#
#IRE#Purpose: Acclimation to hypoxia and anoxia is important in various ecological systems, especially flooded soil. Phyllostachys pracecox is sensitive to flooding, and therefore, it is important to explore ways of alleviating hypoxia stress in the roots. In this study, we investigated the regulatory effect of spermidine (Spd) on flooded P. praecox seedlings. Methods: A batch experiment was carried out in roots treated with Spd under flooding for eight days. The following factors were subsequently measured: growth, survival rate, root respiratory activity, soluble protein and anaerobic respiration enzyme contents (pyruvate decarboxylase, PDC; alcohol dehydrogenase, ADH; lactate dehydrogenase, LDH; alanine aminotransferase, AlaAT), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), nitrate reductase (NR), ACC oxidase (ACO) and ACC synthetase (ACS) activities, free Spd, spermine (Spm) and the diamine precursor putrescine (Put) content, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) content, ethylene emissions and expression of hormone-related genes. Results: Application of Spd promoted root growth (root length, volume, surface and dry weight) and root respiratory inhibition, improved the soluble protein content, and reduced the O2·- production rate, H2O2 and MDA content to alleviate the damage of roots under flooding. A significant increase in SAMDC activity, and ABA and IAA contents were also observed, along with a reduction in ethylene emissions, NR, ACO and ACS activities (p < 0.05). Exogenous Spd increased the free Spd and Spm contents in the P. praecox roots, but decreased the free Put content. Taken together, these findings suggest that hypoxia stress was alleviated. Moreover, exogenous Spd up-regulated the expression of auxin-related genes ARF1, AUX1, AUX2, AUX3 and AUX4, and down-regulated the expression of ethylene-related ACO and ACS genes during flooding. In addition, correlation and RDA analysis showed that ARF1, ACO and ACS significantly promoted the expression of auxin, ACO and ACS enzyme activities, respectively (p < 0.05), while ADH, NR, AlaAT, ethylene emissions, Put, Spd, ACS and ACO were significantly correlated with ACS, ACO, and auxin-related gene expression (p < 0.05). Overall, ethylene emissions, ACS and ACO were identified as the main drivers of ethylene and auxin-related gene structure. Conclusions: These results suggest that Spd regulated hormone concentrations, the content of Spd, Spm and Put, and related gene expression, in turn regulating physiological changes such as anaerobic enzyme activity, mitigating flooding stress in the roots and improving overall growth. Spd therefore has the potential to improve the adaptability of P. praecox to flooding stress. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
