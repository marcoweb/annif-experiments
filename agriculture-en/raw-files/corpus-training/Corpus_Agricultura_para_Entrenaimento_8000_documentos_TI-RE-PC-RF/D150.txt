#ITI#Silicon-induced alterations in the expression of aquaporins and antioxidant system activity in well-watered and drought-stressed oilseed rape#FTI#
#IRE#Progressing climate change necessitates the search for solutions of plant protection against the effects of water deficit. One of these solutions could be silicon supplementation. The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis that silicon changes aquaporin expression and antioxidant system activity in a direction which may alleviate the effects of drought stress in oilseed rape. The accumulation of BnPIP1, BnPIP2-1-7 and BnTIP1;1 aquaporins and the expression of their genes, the level of catalase, superoxide dismutase activities and hydrogen peroxide content as well as total non-enzymatic antioxidant activity were analyzed in leaf tissue from control and silicon-treated oilseed rape plants growing under well-watered and drought conditions. Silicon was applied in two forms – pure silicon and a silicon complex. It was shown that under drought conditions, both pure silicon and the silicon complex (with Fe) significantly increased the accumulation of aquaporins and improved the activity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic components of the antioxidant system, while under well-watered conditions, these effects were observed only in the case of the silicon complex. The presented study proves that silicon supplementation in oilseed rape improves the regulation of water management and contributes to the protection against oxidative stress caused by drought. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
