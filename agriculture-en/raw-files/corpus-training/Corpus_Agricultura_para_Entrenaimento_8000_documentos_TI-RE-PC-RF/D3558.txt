#ITI#Modes of transmission and stability of Rice yellow mottle virus#FTI#
#IRE#Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) is the most important rice virus in Africa. We examined RYMV transmission via soil and water contaminated with RYMV-infected rice plants and by serial cutting with RYMV-contaminated scissors. Transmission of RYMV via dried rice straw kept at 27°C was also examined. The results showed the virus could be transmitted via soil and water, and by scissors. Rice straw that was RYMV-infected was not infective if it was dried and was kept longer than 42 days. By insect transmission experiments and ELISA, long-horned grasshoppers (Conocephalus spp.) were found to be a possible vector of RYMV in Uganda. © Ayaka Uke et al. 2014.#FRE#
