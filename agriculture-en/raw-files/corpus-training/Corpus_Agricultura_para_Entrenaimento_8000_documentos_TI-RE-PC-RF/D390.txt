#ITI#Metabolic pathways modulated by coumarin to inhibit seed germination and early seedling growth in Eleusine indica#FTI#
#IRE#Coumarin is an allelochemical that is widely present in the plant kingdom and has great potential for weed control. However, its mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. This study employed metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses along with evaluations of amino acid profiles and related physiological indicators to investigate how coumarin inhibits the germination and seedling growth of Eleusine indica by modifying metabolic pathways. At 72 h of germination at 50 and 100 mg L−1 coumarin, E. indica had lower levels of soluble sugar and activities of amylases and higher levels of starch, O2−, H2O2, auxin (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) compared to the control. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that coumarin treatments had a significant impact on the pathways associated with amino acid metabolism and transport and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. Exposure to coumarin induced significant alterations in the levels of 19 amino acids, with a decrease in 15 of them, including Met, Leu and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Additionally, transcriptomic analysis showed that coumarin significantly disrupted several essential biological processes, including protein translation, secondary metabolite synthesis, and hormone signal transduction. The decrease in TCA cycle metabolite (cis-aconitate, 2-oxoglutarate, and malate) contents was associated with the suppression of transcription for related enzymes. Our findings indicate that the inhibition of germination and growth in E. indica by coumarin involves the suppression of starch conversion to sugars, modification of the amino acid profile, interference of hormone signalling and the induction of oxidative stress. The TCA cycle appears to be one of the most essential pathways affected by coumarin. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
