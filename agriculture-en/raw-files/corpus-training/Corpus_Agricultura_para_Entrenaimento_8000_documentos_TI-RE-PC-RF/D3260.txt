#ITI#Cytogenetic diversity and characterization of vicia sativa subspecies#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Vicia sativa L. is variable genus comprised of several subspecies. Close relative species and subspecies of the cultivated species are easily usable gene sources because they have gained resistance against a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. The main objectives of this study are to identify and describe the cytogenetical and karyological characteristics of subspecies in the Vicia sativa complex. Methods: The research material consisted of multiple entries collected from the five subspecies of nine taxa. All cytological observations made from root tips. Six chromosomal parameters (chromosome length, relative length, long arm length, short arm length, arm ratio and centromeric index) and five karyotype asymmetric parameters (difference in relative length, total form percentage, intrachromosomal asymmetry index, interchromosomal asymmetry index and mean centromeric asymmetry) were determined. Result: It was determined that the chromosome number of subspecies were 2n =10-12. The haploid chromosome lengths of subspecies were 15.86-33.88 µm and the average chromosome lengths varied between 2.64-5.65 µm. According to the intrachromosomal karyotype asymmetry index analysis, subsp. segetalis was the most asymmetric karyotype and subsp. sativa “Antalya” was the most symmetric karyotype. According to the interchromosomal karyotype asymmetry index analysis, subsp. angustifolia was the most asymmetric karyotype and subsp. nigra was the most symmetric karyotype. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
