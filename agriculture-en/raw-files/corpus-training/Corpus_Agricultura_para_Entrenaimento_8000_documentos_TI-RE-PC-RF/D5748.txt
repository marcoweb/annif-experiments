#ITI#The effects of plant sexual system and latitude on resistance to herbivores#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the Study: The strength of plant-herbivore interactions varies in space and time, but the factors that explain this variation are poorly understood. Several lines of research suggest that variation in plant reproductive systems and latitude may explain resistance against herbivores, but how these factors jointly affect plant-herbivore interactions has not been investigated in detail. We examined the effects of latitude, sexual system, and plant gender on herbivory in Sagittaria latifolia, an aquatic plant in which populations are typically monoecious (separate female and male flowers) or dioecious (separate female and male plants). Methods: We surveyed 43 populations of S. latifolia between 42 and 48° N in Ontario, Canada. In each population, we recorded the sexual system and obtained estimates of herbivore damage to ramets of known gender (i.e. female, male, or hermaphrodite) by the weevil Listronotus appendiculatus, the principal herbivore of S. latifolia. Herbivore damage was quantified as the percent leaf area removed by adult L. appendiculatus weevils, and the abundance of larvae feeding within flowering stalks, which was correlated with the amount of damage by herbivores to the inflorescence. Key Results: Leaf herbivory significantly decreased with increasing latitude but did not vary with sexual system or plant gender. By contrast, larvae were more abundant in dioecious populations and on female plants, corresponding to increased stem damage, providing evidence for sex-biased larval abundance in S. latifolia. These effects of sexual system and gender on larval abundance were strongest at lower latitudes. Conclusions: Our study found latitudinal variation in leaf herbivory and sex-biased resistance to weevil larvae that feed on the reproductive tissues of S. latifolia, which is predicted to be a necessary condition for herbivory to influence the evolution of dioecy. © 2018 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
