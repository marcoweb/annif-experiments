#ITI#TaSINA2B, interacting with TaSINA1D, positively regulates drought tolerance and root growth in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important food crop mainly grown in arid and semiarid regions worldwide, whose productivity is severely limited by drought stress. Although various E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases regulate drought stress, only a few SINA-type E3 Ub ligases are known to participate in such responses. Herein, we identified and cloned 15 TaSINAs from wheat. The transcription level of TaSINA2B was highly induced by drought, osmotic and abscisic acid treatments. Two-type promoters of TaSINA2B were found in 192 wheat accessions; furthermore wheat accessions with promoter TaSINA2BII showed a considerably higher level of drought tolerance and gene expression levels than those characterizing accessions with promoter TaSINA2BI that was mainly caused by a 64 bp insertion in its promoter. Enhanced drought tolerance of TaSINA2B-overexpressing (OE) transgenic wheat lines was found to be associated with root growth promotion. Further, an interaction between TaSINA2B and TaSINA1D was detected through yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. And TaSINA1D-OE transgenic wheat lines showed similar drought tolerance and root growth phenotype to those observed when TaSINA2B was overexpressed. Therefore, the variation of TaSINA2B promoter contributed to the drought stress regulation, while TaSINA2B, interacting with TaSINA1D, positively regulated drought tolerance by promoting root growth. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
