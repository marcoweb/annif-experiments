#ITI#Preliminary molecular characterization of a fowl poxvirus isolate in Grenada#FTI#
#IRE#Two 1-mo-old local breed chickens, with gross lesions in the skin of the head region suspected to be fowl poxvirus infection, were submitted to the Diagnostic Laboratory of the School of Veterinary Medicine, Grenada, West Indies. Cutaneous lesions were collected from these birds for virus isolation, histopathologic diagnosis, and molecular analysis. Fowl poxvirus infection was confirmed by virus isolation in chicken embryo and by histopathology. Molecular characterization of the fowl poxvirus was conducted by PCR amplification of selected genomic fragments and by nucleotide sequencing. Integration of reticuloendotheliosis virus fragments into the fowl poxvirus genome was confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. This is the first report from the Caribbean region on the preliminary molecular characterization of a fowl poxvirus isolate. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
