#ITI#An economic comparison of pesticide applications for processing and table tomatoes: A case study for Turkey#FTI#
#IRE#In many circumstances, pesticides are the only effective means of controlling disease organisms, weeds, or insect pests. Yet, pesticides are toxic and potentially hazardous to humans, other animals and organisms, and the environment. Therefore, people who use pesticides or regularly come in contact with them must understand the relative toxicity, potential health effects, and preventative measures to reduce the exposure to the products they use. Today, farm-level costs include the costs of the pesticides, and their application. This study was conducted to analyse the farm-level economics of pesticide use on the processing and table tomato growing in selected regions of Turkey. Data was collected from 59 processing tomato farmers and 30 table tomato farmers. These farmers were willing to have their data recorded. According to the results of the study, the average usage concerning the active ingredient of pesticides for the processing and table tomatoes were 4,825.02 and 5,273.86 g/ha. Average pesticide and pesticide application costs of the processing and table tomatoes were determined to be $445/ha and $502/ha, respectively. The breakeven yields for the processing and table tomatoes were calculated to be 3,708 and 3,138 kg/ha, repectively.#FRE#
