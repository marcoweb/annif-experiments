#ITI#Exogenous application of sulphydryl compounds enhances growth, photosynthetic efficiency and yield of moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia l.) under water limiting environment#FTI#
#IRE#A two year field experiment was conducted in hot arid region at Bikaner, Rajasthan to investigate the effects of application of sulphydryl compounds (thioglycollic acid, TGA; thiourea TU) on growth traits, photosynthetic efficiency, yield components and yield of moth bean under water deficit conditions. The experiment comprised seven treatments (water spray, TGA 200 mg L-1, TGA 300 mg L-1, TGA 400 mg L-1, TU 500 mg L-1, TU 750 mg L-1 and TU 1000 mg L-1) and laid out in randomized block design with three replications. Application of sulphydryl compounds had significant effects on growth, photosynthetic traits, activities of anti-oxidant enzymes, and yield of moth bean. The sulphydryl compounds sprayed plants had 24-70, 13-40 and 13-20% higher activities of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione reductase, GR; gluthathione-s-transferase, GST), photosynthetic parameters (net photosynthetic rate, PN; stomatal conductance, gs; transpiration rate, E) and seed yield respectively compared to unsprayed plants. The results suggest that application of sulphydryl compounds mitigate moisture deficit induced negative effects on growth and photosynthetic parameters which lead to better seed yield of moth bean.
