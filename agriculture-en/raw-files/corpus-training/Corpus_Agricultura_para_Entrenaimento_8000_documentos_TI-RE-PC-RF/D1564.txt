#ITI#Decomposition, nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization from winter-grown cover crop residues and suitability for a smallholder farming system in South Africa#FTI#
#IRE#Increasing land degradation has prompted interest in conservation agriculture which includes growing cover crops. Besides providing soil cover, decaying cover crops may release substantial amounts of nutrients. Decomposition, N and P release from winter cover crops [grazing vetch (Vicia darsycarpa), forage peas (Pisum sativum) and oats (Avena sativa)] were assessed for suitability in a cropping system found in the smallholder irrigation sector of South Africa. Nitrogen and P contribution to maize growth by cover crop residues was also estimated. Decrease in mass of cover crop residues was highest in grazing vetch (7% remaining mass after 124 days) followed by forage peas (16%) and lastly oats (40%). Maximum net mineralized N and P were higher for grazing vetch (84.8 mg N/kg; 3.6 mg P/kg) than for forage peas (66.3 mg N/kg; 2.7 mg P/ha) and oats (13.7 mg N/kg; 2.8 mg P/kg). Grazing vetch and forage pea residues resulted in higher N contribution to maize stover than oat residues. Farmers may use grazing vetch for improvement of soil mineral N while oats may result in enhancement of soil organic matter and reduction land degradation because of their slow decomposition. Terminating legume cover crops a month before planting summer crops synchronizes nutrient release from winter-grown legume cover crops and uptake by summer crops.
