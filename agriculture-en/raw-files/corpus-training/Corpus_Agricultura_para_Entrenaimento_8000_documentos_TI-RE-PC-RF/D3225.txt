#ITI#Molecular characterization of fusarium oxysporum causing chickpea wilt by internal transcribed spacer (Its) marker#FTI#
#IRE#Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris is one of the serious disease causes tremendous loss to crop throughout the world and has assumed serious proportions in the recent years. Wilt affected chickpea plant roots samples were collected from forty eight different regions of Maharashtra. The collected samples were characterized by designed ITS primers. The Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris (Foc) showed about 302 bp amplicon when subjected to PCR with these primers. Further the amplified product was digested with five restriction enzymes viz. AluI, EcoRI, HaeIII, MboI and MspI and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) pattern were analysed. A dendrogram derived from ITS-RFLP analysis of the rDNA region divided the Foc isolates into four clusters. The maximum genetic distance 0.75 exhibited by five Foc isolates viz. Foc-30, Foc-36, Foc-24, Foc-25 and Foc-48 belonging to Shahartakli, Shelur, Nashik, Satara, Kolhapur regions respectively and found to be more diverse among the other Foc isolates. Whereas isolate no. Foc-20, Foc-21 and Foc-8 from Ambajogai, Karjat and Rahata shown minimum genetic distance (0.13). This showed the genetic variability among the Foc isolates collected from different regions of Maharashtra. Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
