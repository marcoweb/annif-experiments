#ITI#Impact of different organic and inorganic source on yield, quality and uptake of nutrients by kawach beej (Mucuna prurience) on inceptisol#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted at Dr.P.D.K.V., Akola (M.S.) during 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. The experiment comprised of nine treatments involving 2.5 and 5t FYM ha-1, 1 and 2t sheep manure ha-1, 2 and 4t vermicompost ha-1, 25:50 and 12.5: 25 kg ha-1 NP through inorganic and control. Among different treatments, the application of 4t vermicompost ha-1 resulted in significantly increased pod yield (26.19 q ha-1), seed yield (17.62 q ha-1) and dry matter yield (46.68 q ha-1) as well as quality such as L-Dopa (3.63%), protein (26.79%) and test weight (111.69 g) of kawachbeej over control and superior over rest of treatments. The highest seed yield 184.04% and L-DOPA content 101.96% was observed with 4t vermicompost ha-1 over control. The similar trend of results was noticed in uptake of macro (N, P, K, S) and micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu) of kawachbeej and it was at par with treatment 5t FYM ha-1 and 25:50 kg ha-1 NP through inorganic, respectively.
