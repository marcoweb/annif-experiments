#ITI#Identification of Suitable Cobalt Application Method and Optimum Level for Enhancing of Chickpea Yield#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during rabi season of 2015-2016 at Navsari Agricultural University, Navsari to identify suitable cobalt application method and optimum level for enhancing chickpea yield. There were four cobalt application methods and three levels of cobalt each i.e. seed priming at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 ppm, seed treatment at 1, 2 and 3 g kg-1 seed, soil application at 50, 100 and 150 g ha-1, foliar application at 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05% and one control with water priming and one without seed treatment were evaluated in randomized block design with three replications. In general least level of all methods has recorded highest growth and yield of chickpea. As cobalt levels increased, growth and yield of chickpea was decreased linearly in all methods. Soil application of 50 g CoCl2 ha-1 produced highest seed yield hence this treatment can be recommended for higher seed yield and can be useful for succeeding crop.
