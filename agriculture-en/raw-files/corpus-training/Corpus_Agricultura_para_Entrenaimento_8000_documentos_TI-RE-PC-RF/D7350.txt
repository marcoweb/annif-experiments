#ITI#The effect of drip line spacing, irrigation regimes and planting geometries of tomato on yield, irrigation water use efficiency and net return#FTI#
#IRE#This study was conducted in order to determine the effect of drip line spacing, irrigation regimes and planting geometries of tomato on yield, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) and net return. The experiments were carried out in the conditions of Eskisehir in Central Anatolian part of Turkey, between 2003 and 2005, with cv. Dual Large F1 tomatoes (Lycopercion esculentum L). The maximum yield of 121.1 t ha-1 was obtained from the treatment in which both the lateral and row spacing were 1 m, and irrigated with water amount based on the percentage of canopy cover. The seasonal irrigation water amount of the treatment was 551 mm. Tomatoes yield of 109.9 t ha-1 was obtained under conditions of 491 mm seasonal irrigation water applied for the 2-m lateral spacing in which two plant rows (twin rows) were planted 0.35 m on either side of the lateral with a row spacing of 0.70 m across the drip lateral and 1.30 m in the interrow between each set of twin rows. Although water saving of 60 mm and investments economy of 40% were provided from the twin-row design, the yearly return of the design including one lateral for each row was US$ 1590 ha-1 higher than that the return of the twin-row design. The method of determination of irrigation water amount based on the percentage of canopy cover appeared to be the most reasonable and effective one in terms of the yield and IWUE. On the other hand, the maximum irrigation water use efficiency (22.3 kg m3) was obtained from 2-m lateral spacing and the percentage of canopy cover for calculation of the amount of irrigation water applied. Thus, canopy cover may be used successfully at any lateral design conditions. Crown Copyright Â© 2008.#FRE#
