#ITI#Effect of foliar application of growth activator, promoter and antioxidant on seed quality of soybean#FTI#
#IRE#Loss of seed quality in soybean is a serious problem in tropical and subtropical region. Foliar application of salicylic acid (SA), GA3 and acetyl salicylic acid (50 ppm) at seedling and pod filling stage, K2HPO4 (2%), α-tocopherol (100 ppm) at flowering and pod filling stage was done on soybean varieties – NRC 7 and JS 335. Foliar application of SA showed positive effect on seed yield, seed health, germination and seed vigour during storage. Plant height was significantly improved by the GA3 spray in both the varieties. Significantly higher seed yield was obtained with foliar spray of α-tocopherol. Application of SA was found effective to protect plants from various diseases to get quality seed. α-Tocopherol and K2HPO4 treatment significantly reduced MDA production in seeds. α-Tocopherol application increased super oxide dismutase activity as a result the lipid peroxidation of seed during storage was significantly reduced. Application of α-tocopherol, K2HPO4 and salicylic acid improved the storage or keeping quality of soybean seed. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
