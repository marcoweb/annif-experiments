#ITI#Potential of denitrification and nitrous oxide production from agricultural soil profiles (Seine Basin, France)#FTI#
#IRE#The denitrification process and the associated nitrous oxide (N 2O) production in soils have been poorly documented, especially in terms of soil profiles; most work on denitrification has concentrated on the upper layer (first 20 cm). The objectives of this study were to examine the origin of N 2O emission and the effects of in situ controlling factors on soil denitrification and N 2O production, also allowing the (N 2O production)/(NO 3 --N reduction) ratio to be determined through (1) the position on a slope reaching a river and (2) the depth (soil horizons: 10-30 and 90-110 cm). In 2009 and 2010, slurry batch experiments combined with molecular investigations of bacterial communities were conducted in a corn field and an adjacent riparian buffer strip. Denitrification rates, ranging from 0. 30 μg NO 3 --N g -1 dry soil h -1 to 1.44 μg NO 3 --N g -1 dry soil h -1, showed no significant variation along the slope and depth. N 2O production assessed simultaneously differed considerably over the depth and ranged from 0. 4 ng N 2O-N g -1 dry soil h -1 in subsoils (the 90-110-cm layer) to 155.1 ng N 2O-N g -1 dry soil h -1 in the topsoils (the 10-30-cm layer). In the topsoils, N 2O-N production accounted for 8.5-48.0% of the total denitrified NO 3 --N, but for less than 1% in the subsoils. Similarly, N 2O-consuming bacterial communities from the subsoils greatly differed from those of the topsoils, as revealed by their nosZ DGGE fingerprints. High N 2O-SPPR (nitrous oxide semi potential production rates) in comparison to NO 3-SPDR (nitrate semi potential reduction rates) for the topsoils indicated significant potential greenhouse N 2O gas production, whereas lower horizons could play a role in fully removing nitrate into inert atmospheric N 2. In terms of landscape management, these results call for caution in rehabilitating or constructing buffer zones for agricultural nitrate removal. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
