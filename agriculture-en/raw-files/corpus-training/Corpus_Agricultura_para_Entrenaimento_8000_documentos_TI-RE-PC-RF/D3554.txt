#ITI#Application of reduced doses of chlorsulfuron in semi-dwarf and full-height cultivars of winter triticale#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of the field experiments carried out in the years 2009-2011 was to assess the application of reduced doses of chlorsulfuron on yield and quality parameters of winter triticale semi-dwarf and full-height cultivars. The herbicide effect was evaluated in two cultivars, Grenado and Pizarro. The cultivars were of different plant heights. Chlorsulfuron was applied at the recommended dose (15 g a.i. · ha-1), at areduced dose (10.5 g a.i. · ha-1) and at areduced dose with an adjuvant. Treatments with the herbicide were conducted directly after the triticale had been sown. Visual assessment of weed infestation was carried out in spring, after the start of the vegetation of the cultivated plant. The study assessed triticale grain yield, grain number per ear, thousand grain weight, and selected qualitative parameters of grain (protein and starch content). The obtained data proved the usefulness of reduced doses of chlorsulfuron in weed control both separately and in a combination with the adjuvant. The average percent of the weed control was very high for both cultivars and for the assessed doses of herbicide. Both experimental factors (herbicide dose and triticale cultivar) influenced the level of the obtained grain yield of triticale, and the thousand kernel weight. While grain number per ear and protein and starch content depended only on the examined cultivar.#FRE#
