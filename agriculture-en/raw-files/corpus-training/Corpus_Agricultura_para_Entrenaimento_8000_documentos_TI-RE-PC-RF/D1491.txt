#ITI#Effects of the herbicides butachlor and bensulfuron-methyl on N2O emissions from a dry-seeded rice field#FTI#
#IRE#Independent field and laboratory incubation experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of two commonly used herbicides butachlor and bensulfuron-methyl on N2O emissions from a dry-seeded rice field. Three treatments were applied in field experiments: A fertilized control without herbicide, fertilized plots amended with butachlor equivalent to 2.55Lha−1 of 60 % by weight active ingredient and fertilized plots amended with bensulfuron-methyl equivalent to 300 g ha−1 of 10% by weight active ingredient. Herbicides were applied twice in the rice growing season according to local farming practices. The same treatments were used in laboratory incubation experiments, i.e., a fertilized control without herbicide and fertilized soil amended with the herbicide butachlor or bensulfuron-methyl. The soil moisture was adjusted to 0.55 g g−1 in the lab incubation experiments based on the average water content determined in the dry-seeded rice field. The field and laboratory simulation experiments all showed that the butachlor applications led to significantly increased N2O emissions (p<0.05), whereas bensulfuron-methyl had no effect on N2O emissions (p>0.05). Butachlor enhanced the N2O emissions by up to 177.5#x0025; over the entire rice growing season. Moreover, butachlor and bensulfuron-methyl treatment led to a marginal stimulation of the soil respiration rates. A further investigation in the field experiments suggested that the butachlor-enhanced N2O emissions resulted from increased soil ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen contents and the more abundance of ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria in the late stage after the herbicide application. The bensulfuron-methyl treatment had no influence on N2O emissions during the rice growing season, which was attributed to the low soil nitrate nitrogen contents during this period. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
