#ITI#Annual carbon and nitrogen loadings for a furrow-irrigated field#FTI#
#IRE#Evaluations of agricultural management practices for soil C sequestration have largely focused on practices, such as reduced tillage or compost/manure applications, that minimize soil respiration and/or maximize C input, thereby enhancing soil C stabilization. Other management practices that impact carbon cycling in agricultural systems, such as irrigation, are much less understood. As part of a larger C sequestration project that focused on potential of C sequestration for standard and minimum tillage systems of irrigated crops, the effects of furrow irrigation on the field C and N loading were evaluated. Experiments were conducted on a laser-leveled 30 ha grower's field in the Sacramento valley near Winters, CA. For the 2005 calendar year, water inflow and runoff was measured for all rainfall and irrigation events. Samples were analyzed for C and N associated with both sediment and dissolved fractions. Total C and N loads in the sediment were always higher in the incoming irrigation water than field runoff. Winter storms moved little sediment, but removed substantial amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), or about one-third of the total C balance. Despite high DOC loads in runoff, the large volumes of applied irrigation water with sediment and DOC resulted in a net increase in total C for most irrigation events. The combined net C input and N loss to the field, as computed from the field water balance, was 30.8 kg C ha-1 yr-1 and 5.4 kg N ha-1 yr-1 for the 2005 calendar year. It is concluded that transport of C and N by irrigation and runoff water should be considered when estimating the annual C field balance and sequestration potential of irrigated agro-ecosystems.
