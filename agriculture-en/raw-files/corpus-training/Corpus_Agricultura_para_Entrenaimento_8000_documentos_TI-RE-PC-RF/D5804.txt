#ITI#Evolution of root apical meristem structures in vascular plants: plasmodesmatal networks#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the study: The apical meristem generates indeterminate apical growth of the stem and root of vascular plants. Our previous examination showed that shoot apical meristems (SAMs) can be classified into two types based on plasmodesmatal networks (PNs), which are important elements in symplasmic signaling pathways within the apical meristem. Here, we examined the PNs of root apical meristems (RAMs) in comparison with those of SAMs. Methods: Root apical meristems of 18 families and 22 species of lycophytes and euphyllophytes were analyzed. Plasmodesmata (PD) in cell walls in median longitudinal sections of RAMs were enumerated using transmission electron micrographs, and the PD density per 1 μm2 of each cell wall was calculated. Key results: Root apical meristems with prominent apical cells of monilophytes (euphyllophytes) and Selaginellaceae (lycophytes) had high PD densities, while RAMs with plural initial cells of gymnosperms and angiosperms (euphyllophytes), and of Lycopodiaceae and Isoetaceae (lycophytes) had low PD densities. This correlation between structures of apical meristems and PD densities is identical to that in SAMs already described. Conclusions: Irrespective of their diversified structures, the RAMs of vascular plants can be classified into two types with respect to PNs: the fern (monilophyte) type, which has a lineage-specific PN with only primary PD, and the seed-plant type, which has an interspecific PN with secondary PD in addition to primary PD. PNs may have played a key role in the evolution of apical meristems in vascular plants. © 2018 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
