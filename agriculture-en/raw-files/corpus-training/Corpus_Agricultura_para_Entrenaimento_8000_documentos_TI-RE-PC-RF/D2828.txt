#ITI#Evaluation of Maize (Zea mays L.) + Legume Intercropping System for Productivity, Profitability, Energy Budgeting and Soil Health in Hill Terraces of Eastern Himalayan Region#FTI#
#IRE#Three-year (2014-2016) field experiment was conducted for evaluation of maize (Zea mays L.) based intercropping system for productivity, profitability, energy budgeting and soil health in Eastern Himalayan region. The treatments consisted of four sole crop viz. maize, soybean, groundnut, cowpea and six intercropping treatments viz. maize + groundnut (1:1), maize + soybean (1:1), maize + cowpea (1:1) and strip cropping of maize + groundnut (4:4), maize + soybean (4:4), maize + cowpea (4:4). The highest maize equivalent yield (10.2 t ha-1) was recorded in maize + groundnut cropping system (1:1) followed by maize + soybean (1:1) with 8.9 t ha-1. The highest SNBC (soil microbial biomass carbon) (66.2 mg g-1) and organic carbon (1.3%) were recorded with the cultivation of cowpea as a sole or intercrop. Strip cropping system, maize + cowpea (4:4) recorded the highest soil available N, P2 O5 and K2 O kg ha-1, highest energy efficiency (12.53) and energy productivity (955.01 g MJ-1).
