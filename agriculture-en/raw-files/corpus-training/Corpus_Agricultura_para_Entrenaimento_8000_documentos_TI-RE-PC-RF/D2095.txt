#ITI#Light fraction organic N, ammonium, nitrate and total N in a thin Black Chernozemic soil under bromegrass after 27 annual applications of different N rates#FTI#
#IRE#An adequate supply of N for a crop depends among others on the amounts of N that are mineralized from the soil organic matter plus the supply of ammonium and nitrate N already present in the soil. The objective of this study was to determine the behaviour of light fraction organic N (LFN), NH4-N, NO3-N and total N (TN) in soil in response to different rates of fertilizer N application. The 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-30 cm layers of a thin Black Chernozemic soil under bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss) at Crossfield, Alberta, Canada, were sampled after 27 annual applications of ammonium nitrate at rates of 0, 56, 112, 168, 224 and 336 kg N ha-1. The concentration and mass of TN and LFN in the soil, and the proportion of LFN mass within the TN mass usually increased with N rates up to 224 kg N ha-1. The increase in TN mass and LFN mass per unit of N added was generally maximum at 56 kg N ha-1 and declined with further increases in the rate of N application. The percent change in response to N application was much greater for the LFN mass than for the TN mass for all the N rates and all soil depths that were sampled. Mineral N in the form of NH4-N and NO3-N did not accumulate in the soil at ≤ 112 kg N ha-1 rates, whereas their accumulation increased markedly with rates of ≥ 168 kg N ha-1. In conclusion, long-term annual fertilization at ≤ 112 kg N ha-1 to bromegrass resulted in substantial increase in the TN and LFN in soil, with no accumulation of NH4-N and NO3-N down the depth. The implication of these findings is that grasslands for hay can be managed by appropriate N fertilization rates to increase the level of organic N in soil.#FRE#
