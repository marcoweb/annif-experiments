#ITI#Allocation of ecological water rights considering ecological networks in arid watersheds: A framework and case study of Tarim River basin#FTI#
#IRE#A robust water supply system is significant to the local ecosystem of riparian vegetation in the arid basin. Considering the elasticity and relative importance of ecological water use in different regions of the basin, this study defines the ecological water rights on a multi-year scale, divides the priority of those rights based on the ecological network, and proposes a rights allocation method. The application of the method to the mainstream watershed of Tarim River in China shows that when the overall available ecological water is only 77% of the ecological water demand, it can ensure that the ecological water demand of vegetation in important areas is fully met and the growth condition is good. However, the demand in non-important areas must be less than 50% and the growth condition will deteriorate. This method expands the existing definition and distribution of water rights, and the approach of coupling ecological networks can be used for the efficient management of ecological water supply in other arid basins. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
