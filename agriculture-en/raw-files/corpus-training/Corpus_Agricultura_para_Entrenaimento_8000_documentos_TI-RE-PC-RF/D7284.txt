#ITI#Fruit growth, yield and oil quality changes induced by deficit irrigation at different stages of olive fruit development#FTI#
#IRE#Experiments were performed in a high-density olive orchard to compare the effect of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) at two different phenological stages with fully-irrigated trees (FI) over two years. Stress was imposed either prior to pit hardening (RDI 1) or after endocarp sclerification during the initial phase of oil accumulation (RDI 2). Fully irrigated trees received 2277 and 1648 m3 ha−1 in 2012 and 2013, respectively, RDI 1 ones 76 and 53% of those volumes in 2012 and 2013, respectively (RDI 2 trees 48 and 67%). There were no differences in fruit set or return bloom due to the irrigation regime. At harvest differences in fruit size between FI and RDI treatments were significant only in the first year. The fruit yields of RDI 1 and RDI 2 trees were 70 and 81% of FI ones, respectively (means of two years), but the yield efficiency was similar across all treatments. The phenolic concentration in RDI 1 fruits was higher than that in fruits from trees subjected to the other water regimes. Verbascoside, 3–4 DHPEA-EDA, and oleuropein of RDI 1 fruits were higher in 2012 (only verbascoside in 2013). Oleuropein and 3–4 DHPEA-EDA of RDI treatments were higher than those of FI in 2013. Higher concentrations of biophenols were measured in oils from RDI 1 trees in both years, whereas FI and RDI 2 showed similar values. An early water stress was more effective to increase the phenolic concentration of olive oil compared with a late deficit or full irrigation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
