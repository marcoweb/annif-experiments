#ITI#Assessing internal crop nitrogen use efficiency in high-yielding irrigated cotton#FTI#
#IRE#Improving the efficiency of nitrogen (N) fertiliser use is one means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in irrigated crops such as cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). Internal crop N use efficiency (iNUE) was measured within two N fertiliser rate experiments that covered a wide range of N fertility over six cropping seasons. Crop iNUE was determined by dividing lint yield by crop N uptake. No nutrients other than N limited cotton growth or yield and the crops were irrigated to avoid drought stress. The optimal N fertiliser rates were determined from fitted quadratic functions that related lint yields with N fertiliser rates for each cropping system in each year. When the optimal N fertiliser rate was applied, crop iNUE averaged 12.5 ± 0.2 kg lint/kg crop N uptake. The crop iNUE was then used to determine the degree to which N fertiliser was under or over-applied, with respect to the economic optimum N fertiliser rate. Low iNUE values were associated with excessive N fertiliser application. Crop iNUE was determined in 82 commercial cotton crops in six valleys over the final 4 years of this study. The crop iNUE value was high in 8 fields (10%), optimal in 9 fields (11%) and low in 65 fields (79%). Crop N uptake averaged 247 kg N/ha, yield 2,273 kg lint/ha and crop iNUE 10.1 kg lint/kg crop N uptake for these sites. Averaged over all sites and years, about 49 kg N/ha too much N fertiliser was applied. Apparent N fertiliser recovery by cotton in the N rate experiments ranged from <20% in N-fertile treatments where legume crops had been grown, to more than 60% following winter cereal crops. Information on crop iNUE will enable cotton producers to assess their N fertiliser management and adjust N fertiliser rates for future crops. This study has demonstrated that there is scope to substantially reduce N fertiliser inputs to Australian cotton fields without reducing yields. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
