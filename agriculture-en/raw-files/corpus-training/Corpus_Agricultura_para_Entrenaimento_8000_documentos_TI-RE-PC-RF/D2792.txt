#ITI#Regeneration of plantlets from immature explants culture in Glycine max (L.) merrill#FTI#
#IRE#For plant regeneration through somatic embryogenesis, immature cotyledonary nodes and embryonic axes explants of soybean cultivars JS 335 were cultured on six different medium fortified with MS salts, B5 vitamins and combinations of growth regulators. Between explants, immature embryonic axes demonstrated better regeneration potential as compared to cotyledonary node. For immature embryonic axes culture, better morphogenic callus induction, embryogenesis, organogenesis and plantlet regeneration was observed on MS with 4 B1.86N, MS 10N, MS.1B1N and MS.2B1N as compared to other media formulations. Cotyledonary nodes exhibited higher callus induction, embryogenesis, organogenesis on media with MS4 B1.86N, MS.1B1N, MS 3B6N and higher plantlet regeneration on media with MS.5B1N. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
