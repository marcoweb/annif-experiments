#ITI#Effect of Genotype and Sowing Period on Chickpea Quality, Bioactive and Antioxidant Traits#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Climate change is expected to be a major constraint for chickpea as it increases the frequency of drought and temperature extremes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of drought and heat stress conditions on chickpeas’ physical, quality and bioactive traits, along with antioxidant activity of five chickpea genotypes in normal and late sowning conditions. Methods: Field trials were carried out at Institute of Industrial and Forage Crops. All the five genotypes were planted at two different sowing dates, one during the normal sowing period (February 28, 2019) and one off-season (April 1, 2019) in order to achieve dry-heat conditions during the chickpea’s critical stages of off-season sowing. Result: Sowing period significantly affected cooking time and bioactive traits, resulted in decreased cooking time and increased bioactive traits values, in the later sowing period. Genotype’s effects were significant for all the traits studied. Amorgos appeared to be a promising variety with high nutritive value as it showed the highest values in terms of bioactive traits and antioxidant activity in both sowing periods, combined with low cooking time and high protein content at the off-season sowing. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
