#ITI#Molecular physiology for the increase of soluble sugar accumulation in citrus fruits under drought stress#FTI#
#IRE#To investigate the mechanism for drought promoting soluble sugar accumulation will be conducive to the enhancement of citrus fruit quality as well as stress tolerance. Fruit sucrose mainly derives from source leaves. Its accumulation in citrus fruit cell vacuole involves in two processes of unloading in the fruit segment membrane (SM) and translocating to the vacuole of fruit juice sacs (JS). Here, transcript levels of 47 sugar metabolism- and transport-related genes were compared in fruit SM or JS between drought and control treatments. Results indicated that transcript levels of cell wall invertase genes (CwINV2/6) and sucrose synthase genes (SUS2/6) in the SM were significantly increased by the drought. Moreover, transcript levels of SWEET genes (CsSWEET1/2/4/5/9) and monosaccharide transporter gene (CsPMT3) were significantly increased in SM under drought treatment. On the other hand, SUS1/3 and vacuolar invertase (VINV) transcript levels were significantly increased in JS by drought; CsPMT4, sucrose transporter gene 2 (CsSUT2), tonoplast monosaccharide transporter gene 2 (CsTMT2), sugar transport protein gene 1 (CsSTP1), two citrus type I V-PPase genes (CsVPP1, and CsVPP2) were also significantly increased in drought treated JS. Collectively, the imposition of drought stress resulted in more soluble sugar accumulation through enhancing sucrose download by enhancing sink strength- and transport ability-related genes, such as CwINV2/6, SUS2/6, CsSWEET1/2/4/5/9, and CsPMT3, in fruit SM, and soluble sugar storage ability by increasing transcript levels of genes, such as CsPMT4, VINV, CsSUT2, CsTMT2, CsSTP1, CsVPP1, and CsVPP2, in fruit JS. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
