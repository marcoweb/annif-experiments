#ITI#Pathogenicity of embryo-adapted serotype 2 OH strain of infectious bursal disease virus in chickens and turkeys#FTI#
#IRE#The pathogenicity of serotype 2 OH strain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) to specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos and 2-wk-old SPF chickens and turkey poults was investigated. The virus was pathogenic for chicken embryos after five passages as evidenced by pathologic changes in inoculated embryos. The embryo-adapted virus was not pathogenic for 2-wk-old SPF chickens and turkey poults as indicated by lack of clinical signs, gross or microscopic lesions in the bursa of Fabricius of inoculated birds. Bursa-to-body-weight ratios of the inoculated chickens and turkey poults were not significantly different from those of uninoculated controls. Virus-neutralizing antibodies to serotype 2 IBDV were detected in inoculated chickens and turkeys. Results of this study indicated that the embryo-adapted serotype 2 OH IBDV isolate that is pathogenic for chicken embryos is infectious but not pathogenic in chickens and turkeys.#FRE#
