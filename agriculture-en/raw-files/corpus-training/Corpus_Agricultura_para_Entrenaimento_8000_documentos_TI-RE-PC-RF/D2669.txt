#ITI#The effect of salinity on root architecture in forage pea (Pisum sativum ssp. arvense l.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Plants face different abiotic stresses such as salinity that affect their normal development, growth and survival. Forage pea is an important legume crop for herbage production in ruminants. Its agronomy requires high levels of irrigation and fertilization. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of salinity on seedling root system development in forage pea under semi-hydroponics conditions. Methods: Different treatment of NaCl doses (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 mM) on root architecture was investigated in two different forage pea cultivars (Livioletta and Ulubatlı) with contrasting root structures under controlled conditions. The experimental design was completely randomized design with three replications and nine plants per replication. Result: Salinity affects root and shoot development differently on these cultivars. Despite the salinity, Livioletta produced more shoot (0.71 g) and root biomass (0.30 g) compared to Ulubatlı (0.52 g and 0.25 g for Root and Shoot biomass, respectively) at 150 mM and all other salinity levels. Livioletta developed a better root system and tolerated salt to a higher dose than Ulubatlı. Understanding root system responses of forage pea cultivars may allow breeding and selecting salinity tolerant cultivars with better rooting potential. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
