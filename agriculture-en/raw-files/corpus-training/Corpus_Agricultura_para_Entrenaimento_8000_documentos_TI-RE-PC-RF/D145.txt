#ITI#XAP5 CIRCADIAN TIMEKEEPER specifically modulates 3’ splice site recognition and is important for circadian clock regulation partly by alternative splicing of LHY and TIC#FTI#
#IRE#Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step during gene expression, which takes place in the spliceosome, a large dynamic ribonucleoprotein complex assembled in a stepwise manner. During the last decade, several spliceosomal mutants were functionally identified to cause a lengthened circadian period by introducing intron retention defects into circadian clock genes in Arabidopsis. However, the spliceosomal components that play opposite roles in the circadian period via alternative 3′ splice site (Alt 3'ss) are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that XCT (XAP5 CIRCADIAN TIMEKEEPER) is a key spliceosomal component associated with multiple splicing factors. Moreover, genome-wide analysis revealed that inactivation of XCT particularly results in defects in Alt 3'ss recognition by RNA sequencing. Further analysis indicated that a strong alteration in the 3′ splice sites of LHY and TIC partly accounts for the shortened circadian period of the xct mutant. Therefore, our results demonstrated that mutations in XCT shortened the circadian period partly by alternative splicing of LHY and TIC particularly in 3′ splice site recognition, which provides new insight into the link between alternative splicing and the circadian clock. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
