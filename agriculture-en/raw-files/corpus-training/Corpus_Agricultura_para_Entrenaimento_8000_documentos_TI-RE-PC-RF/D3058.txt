#ITI#Stability of mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] genotypes for seed yield during summer#FTI#
#IRE#Experiments were conducted to study the stability performance over three environments for seed yield in mungbean cultivars during summer. Twenty two genotypes were evaluated by using randomized complete block design with three replications. The analysis of variance at individual locations showed significant differences among genotypes. Further, pooled analysis of variance over environments displayed highly significant differences among the genotypes, environments and G×E interaction and the contribution of genotypes, environments and G x E to the total variability were 31.94, 40.74 and 12.52 per cent, respectively. Based on the stability parameters genotypes, Co-6, LGG 460 and Pusa 7092 were found stable and high yielding across the years during summer. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
