#ITI#Effect of Artemisia annua L. essential oil on toxicity, enzyme activities, and energy reserves of cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)#FTI#
#IRE#The essential oil of Artemisia annua L., a weed collected from northern Iran, was studied for its toxicity and physiological aspects on 4th instar larva of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera Hübner in controlled conditions (26±1°C, 65±10% RH and 16 L : : 8 D h). The artificial diet was used as a medium for investigating the toxicity and the effect of LC10, LC30, LC50, and LC90 on the feeding efficiency of 4th instar larva. The essential oil in doses of LC10, LC30, LC50, and LC90 were estimated to be 2.01%, 3.86%, 6.07%, and 18.34%, respectively. The activity of α-amylase, protease, lipase, general esterases, and glutathione S-transferase and protein, triglyceride, glucose for treated larva were measured. The results showed that all of these parameters were decreased compared with the control. Hence, A. annua essential oil is suggested as a botanical for controlling this important pest of field crops. © by Jalal Jalali Sendi 2015.#FRE#
