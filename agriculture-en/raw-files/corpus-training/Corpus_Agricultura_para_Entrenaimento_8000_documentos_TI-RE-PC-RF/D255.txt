#ITI#Investigation of sugar signaling behaviors involved in sucrose-induced senescence initiation and progression in N. tabacum#FTI#
#IRE#Sugar is involved in initiating leaf senescence. However, its regulatory role, especially as a signal in the senescence process, is unclear. Therefore, this study was designed to illustrate how sugar stimulates the onset of leaf senescence and controls sugar homeostasis through the T6P-SnRK (sucrose non-fermenting (SNF)-related kinase) and HXK (hexokinase) signaling pathways. We used a leaf disc system detached from fully expanded leaves of Nicotiana tabacum cv. K326 and designed a time-course study (days 3, 5, 7, and 9) with exogenously gradient concentrations (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 mM) of sucrose (Suc) treatment to identify how Suc application affects sugar metabolism and induces senescence. Our results revealed that early decreases of Fv/Fm and increases in electrolyte leakage responded to Suc on day 3. Furthermore, a substantial increase in lipid peroxidation and up-regulated expression of senescence marker genes (NtSAG12) (except 60 mM on day 3) responded sequentially by day 5. The glucose, G6P, and HXK contents were first induced by Suc on day 3 and then repressed from day 5 to day 7. However, exogenous Suc treatment significantly improved the TPS content and the subsequent precursor T6P from day 3 to day 7. Following exogenous Suc treatments, the transcript level of NtSnRK1 was markedly down-regulated from day 3 to day 7. On the other hand, a linear regression analysis demonstrated that the T6P-NtSnRK1 signaling pathway was strongly associated with senescence initiation, and was accompanied by membrane degradation and NtCP1/NtSAG12 up-regulation by day 3. The T6P-NtSnRK1 signaling pathway experienced membrane and chloroplast degradation by day 5. HXK functioned as a metabolic enzyme promoting Glc-G6P and as a Glc sensor, accelerating the initiation of senescence through the HXK-dependent pathway by repressing PSII by day 3 and the senescence process through the Glycolytic pathway by day 7. These physiological, biochemical, and molecular analyses demonstrate that exogenous Suc regulates T6P accumulation, inducing senescence through the NtSnRK signaling pathway. These results illustrate the role of Suc and the transition of the sugar signaling pathway during the progression of senescence initiation. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
