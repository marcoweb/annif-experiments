#ITI#Physio-molecular responses of tomato cultivars to biotic stress: Exploring the interplay between Alternaria alternata OP881811 infection and plant defence mechanisms#FTI#
#IRE#Plant fungal diseases impose a formidable challenge for global agricultural productivity, a meticulous examination of host-pathogen interactions. In this intricate study, an exhaustive investigation was conducted on infected tomatoes obtained from Egyptian fields, leading to the precise molecular identification of the fungal isolate as Alternaria alternata (OP881811), and the isolate showed high identity with Chinese isolates (ON973896 and ON790502). Subsequently, fourteen diverse tomato cultivars; Cv Ferment, Cv 103, Cv Damber, Cv 186, Cv 4094, Cv Angham, Cv N 17, Cv Gesma, Cv 010, Cv branch, cv 2020, Cv 023, Cv Gana and Cv 380 were meticulously assessed to discern their susceptibility levels upon inoculation with Alternaria alternata. Thorough scrutiny of disease symptom manifestation and the extent of tomato leaf damage ensued, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of cultivar responses. Results unveiled a spectrum of plant susceptibility, with three cultivars exhibiting heightened vulnerability (Cv Ferment, Cv 103 and Cv Damber), five cultivars displaying moderate susceptibility (Cv 186, Cv 4094, Cv Angham, Cv N 17 and Cv Gesma), and six cultivars demonstrating remarkable resilience to the pathogen (Cv 010, Cv branch, cv, 2020; Cv 023, Cv Gana and Cv 380). In order to gain a thorough understanding of the underlying physiological patterns indicative of plant resistance against A. alternata, an in-depth exploration of polyphenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant enzymes ensued. These key indicators were closely examined, offering valuable insights into the interplay between plant physiology and pathogen response. Robust correlations emerged, with higher contents of these compounds correlating with heightened susceptibility, while lower levels were indicative of enhanced plant tolerance. In tandem with the physiological assessment, a thorough investigation of four pivotal defensive genes (PR5, PPO, PR3, and POX) was undertaken, employing cutting-edge Real-Time PCR technology. Gene expression profiles displayed intriguing variations across the evaluated tomato cultivars, ultimately facilitating the classification of cultivars into distinct groups based on their levels of resistance, moderate susceptibility, or heightened sensitivity. By unravelling the intricate dynamics of plant susceptibility, physiological responses, and patterns of gene expression, this comprehensive study paves the way for targeted strategies to combat plant fungal diseases. The findings contribute valuable insights into host-pathogen interactions and empower agricultural stakeholders with the knowledge required to fortify crop resilience and safeguard global food security. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
