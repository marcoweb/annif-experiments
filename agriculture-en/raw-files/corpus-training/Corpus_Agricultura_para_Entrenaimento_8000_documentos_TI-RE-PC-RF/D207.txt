#ITI#Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses identified key genes associated with sugar and acid metabolism in sweet and sour pomegranate cultivars during the developmental period#FTI#
#IRE#Pomegranate (Punica granatum), an important fruit tree in the world, is rich in bioactive substances and has broad prospects for development. In this study, gene expression levels and the concentrations of metabolites involved in the metabolism of soluble sugars and organic acids were investigated in sweet and sour pomegranate cultivars at the S1 (July 25) stage, S2 (August 26) stage, and S3 (September 24) stage. The results showed that glucose, fructose, citric acid, and malic acid were predominantly present in pomegranate. The expression of invertase 2 (INV2), INV1, FRK2, FRK7, PFK2, PFK7, and HK1 was closely correlated with the fructose and glucose contents during different developmental stages, whereas the expression of sucrose synthase 3 (SUS3) and INV1 was negatively correlated with the sucrose content. The expression of MDH (c28468_g3) and WRKY42 (c20711_g1) genes were closely related to the content of sucrose, malic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid during different developmental stages. Gene expression and metabolite concentrations varied between the two cultivars. The results provide valuable information for gene discovery, marker-assisted selection, and investigation of metabolism mechanisms in pomegranate fruits. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
