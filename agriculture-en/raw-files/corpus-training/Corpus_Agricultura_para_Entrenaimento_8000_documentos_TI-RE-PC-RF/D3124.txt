#ITI#Stability analysis of disease reactions and yield of green gram [Vigna radiate (L.)Wilczck] against anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum truncatum#FTI#
#IRE#                             Experiment was conducted during 2012-2014 to screen 41 green gram genotypes against anthracnose (Colletotrichum truncatum) under the effect of challenge inoculation both in vivo and in field at university research farm AB block, Gayespur and Jaguli, Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, West Bengal, India. Attempt was also made to evaluate the stability in yield and disease reactions under this specific biotic stress. Under in-vivo condition all the 38genotypes were found to be moderately resistant except three Sonali, PM-4 and Pusa-1174 showed moderately susceptible reaction. Whereas, in field stability analysis showed that four genotypes TARM-18, CZMK-1, PM-D5 and Sukumar were resistant, three genotypes were moderately susceptible (Sonali, PM-4 Pusa-1174) and 34 genotypes showed moderately resistant reaction. Whereas, among the 34 moderately resistant genotypes, 18 genotypes RMG-62, RVSM-14, NVL-638, HUM-16, Utkarsha, CZMS-1, AKMN-09-02, ML-1464, KM12-29, AKM-10-13, PM-2, PUSA 0932, RMG-975, IPM-306-6, MB-37, IPM-3/2-2, ML-1741 appeared to be stable for disease reaction and yield with high regression co-efficient (bi>_1) and low deviation from regression.
