#ITI#Misuses of the terms Day of the Year and Julian Day in agricultural and environmental sciences#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this short communication is to establish a discussion about the correct use of the terms Julian Day and Day of the Year. The Day of the Year is used for environmental modelling and calculating daily solar radiation and evapotranspiration. The concept of Julian Day is misused in the field of agricultural and environmental sciences. Specifically, the use of the term Julian Day might have been misleading or incorrect for the last ten years in the journal Agricultural Water Management. In this brief communication we intend to clarify the concept of Julian Day, and expose the most commonly used equations, so that the concept might be used with more rigor and precision in the future.
