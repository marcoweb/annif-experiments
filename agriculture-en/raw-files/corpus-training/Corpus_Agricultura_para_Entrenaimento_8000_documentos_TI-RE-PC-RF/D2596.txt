#ITI#Cross Genera Marker Transferability and Genetic Diversity Analysis in Elite Cultivars of Mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek]#FTI#
#IRE#Backgrounds: To increase the accessibility of molecular markers for germplasm evaluation, genetic analysis and new cultivar development in mung bean, cross genera transferability of microsatellites (SSR) was studied. Methods: Forty simple sequence repeat markers developed for adzuki bean were used to amplify genomic DNA extracted from 70 diverse elite cultivars of greengram. Result: All SSR markers (100%) generated repeatable and clear products, signifying a high genomic homology between two species of Vigna. Among the 40 amplified markers, only 11 (28%) were highly polymorphic in 70 diverse elite cultivars of greengram. The polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged between 0.64 to 0.88 with an average of 0.81, while number of alleles ranged with 6 to 12 with an average of 9.27 alleles per locus. The multiple locus amplification and high PIC values indicated the effectiveness of the transferable SSRs in mungbean. Cluster analysis based on UPGMA grouped the studied genotypes into eleven clusters. The Jaccard’s similarity coefficient ranged from 0.17 to 0.46 indicating the extent of transitional amount of genetic variability within the tested genotypes. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
