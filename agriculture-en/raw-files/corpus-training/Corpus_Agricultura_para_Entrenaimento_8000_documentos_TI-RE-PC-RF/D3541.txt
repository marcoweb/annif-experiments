#ITI#Selected elements of the biology and demographic parameters of the anholocyclic species Myzus Ornatus (Laing, 1932)#FTI#
#IRE#Myzus ornatus (Laing, 1932) is an anholocyclic and polyphagous species. In winter it can continue developing by infesting decorative plants in greenhouses and houses. This paper verified the length of the pre-reproductive, reproductive and post-reproductive stages of wingless and winged female M. ornatus that develop in winter months. The total life span and female fecundity were determined. The basic demographic parameters of a M. ornatus population were calculated. Significant statistical differences between the post-reproductive phase, life span and fecundity of wingless and winged females are presented. During the development of one generation, the population increases 37.41 fold. The ability to develop in winter, in greenhouses and houses, means it is possible for M. ornatus to infest host plants early in spring, as soon as temperatures become advantageous for plant development.#FRE#
