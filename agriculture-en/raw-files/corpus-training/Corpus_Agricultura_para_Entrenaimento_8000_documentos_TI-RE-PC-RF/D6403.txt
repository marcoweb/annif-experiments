#ITI#Soil fertility and rainfall during specific phenological phases affect seed trait variation in a widely distributed Neotropical tree, Copaifera langsdorffii#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Knowledge of intra-specific variation in seed traits and its environmental determinants is important for predicting plant responses to environmental changes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that differences in soil fertility and rainfall during specific phenological phases drive variation in seed traits in a widely distributed tree, Copaifera langsdorffii. We also tested the hypothesis that climatic heterogeneity increases within-plant variation in seed traits. Methods: Inter- and intra-population and within-plant variation in seed mass, number, and seed size/seed number were evaluated for 50 individuals from five populations distributed along a rainfall gradient and occurring on varying soil types. Using multivariate approaches, we tested the effects of soil fertility characteristics and rainfall in five reproductive phenological phases on seed traits. Results: The seed traits varied greatly both among populations and within plants. Inter-population variation in seed mass was driven by total rainfall during fruit development, and variation in seed number was influenced by total rainfall during the dry season before the reproductive phase. Phosphorus levels and potential acidity of the soil also explained the variations in seed mass and seed mass/seed number, respectively. A positive association between intra-annual variation in rainfall and within-plant variation in seed mass and seed number was found. Conclusion: Both rainfall during specific reproductive phases and soil conditions shape the variation in the seed mass and number of C. langsdorffii. Environment-driven seed trait variation may contribute to this species’ broad niche breadth, which in turn may determine the species’ persistence under future climatic conditions. © 2019 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
