#ITI#Productivity and profitability of cereal-legume forages vis-a-vis their effect on soil nutrient status in indo-gangetic plains#FTI#
#IRE#The present study was conducted to evaluation of production potential of different forage crops commonly gown by farmers. The experiment was carried out in randomized complete block design with eight treatments and three replications at research farm of Agronomy Section, ICAR-NDRI, Karnal (Haryana). Among eight treatments, two perennial forage crops napier bajra hybrid(NBH), guinea grass cultivated sole as well as intercropping with cowpea and four seasonal fodder crops (cowpea, sorghum, baby corn and maize) were tested for their physio-morphological, biomass yield responses and economic efficiency. Experimental results showed that among the different forage crops significantly highest green as well as dry fodder yield were revealed from NBH intercropped with cowpea 63.79 and 11.95 t/ha green biomass fodder yield (GBY) and dry fodder yield respectively; which were found at par with sole NBH treatment (60.69&11.68 t/ha GBY and DFY). Amongs the different forage crops lowest GBY and DFY 33.1and 5.68 t/ha was produced by baby corn and cowpea respectively. The magnitude of the yield advantage was observed maximum and in the tune of 20.69% with guinea intercropped with cowpea against sole guinea. Highest net return was obtained from dual purpose baby corn (`1.60 lakh/ha) with B: C ratio (5.26) and economic efficiency (`2471/ha/day), followed by in NBH intercropped with cowpea. Based on the study, it is clearly indicated that dual purpose baby corn followed by NBH + cowpea intercropping could be feasible option for increasing the overall productivity of dairy farmers in Indo-Gangetic plains and elsewhere similar conditions prevails.
