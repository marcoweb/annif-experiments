#ITI#Growth of Legume Cover Crops under Cassava and Its Effect on Soil Properties#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Low soil organic carbon is a constraint to cassava tuber formation. Some legume cover crops could be an alternative to provide organic matter on the cassava field as a source of soil organic carbon. The study was aimed to evaluate the growth of some legume cover crops under cassava and their effects on soil properties. Methods: During September 2017-July 2018 legume cover crops (Calopogonium mucunoides, Centrosema pubescens, Pueraria javanica and the mixed) were planted under cassava variety of Mangu and UJ-5. The land coverage by the legume cover crops was measured monthly from 2 to 10 months after planting. Cassava growth was observed weekly from 8 to 32 weeks after planting. Soil properties were analyzed before planting and at harvesting of cassava. Result: Pueraria javanica was tolerant toward cassava shading. The land coverage was linearly increased along with the growth of cassava. At the end of cassava growth, the land area coverage by this legume cover crop was 98.08%. It produced more organic matter and could maintain soil moisture content than other legume cover crops. P. javanica could consider being a suitable legume cover crop under cassava to improve soil quality. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
