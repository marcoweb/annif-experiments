#ITI#Peach tree response to single and combined deficit irrigation regimes in deep soils#FTI#
#IRE#The response of mature 'Andross' cling peach (Prunus persica L. Batch) trees to regulated deficit irrigation in deep soils was studied for 3 years. Trees were either fully irrigated or subjected to deficit irrigation during Stage II of fruit development and/or during post-harvest. Single regulated deficit irrigation regimes reduced irrigation by 13-24%, while combined regime reduced it by 23-35%. Deficit irrigation during Stage II and/or post-harvest significantly reduced vegetative growth of the trees. Fruit production was not affected by any irrigation regime until the fourth year when fruit set decreased slightly with combined deficit irrigation. Overall, the results indicate that regulated deficit irrigation can be used successfully on peach trees grown in deep soils. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
