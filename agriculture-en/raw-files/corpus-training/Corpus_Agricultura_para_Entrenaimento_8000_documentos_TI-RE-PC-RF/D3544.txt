#ITI#Application of new bioformulations of Pseudomonas aureofaciens for biocontrol of cotton seedling damping-off#FTI#
#IRE#Pseudomonas aureofaciens (30-84) is a phenazine producing bacterium and reported as asuccessful biocontrol agent of some plant fungal pathogens. In the present study, the possibility of biological control of cotton damping-off caused by Rhizoctonia solani (AG-4) through phenazine production by the 30-84 strain, was investigated. In the search for the development of bioformulations of Pa (m) (PhzR-) and Pa (w) (PhzR+) strains of 30-84, four new carriers including soybean meal (SM), cottonseed meal (CM), rice bran (RB), and talc powder (TAL) were selected. The efficacy of bacterial formulations in reducing disease incidence was evaluated in four intervals (15, 30, 45, and 60 days after sowing), and compared with each bacterial suspension efficacy under green-house conditions. The results revealed that organic carriers were more effective than talc powder. It was also found that all the bioformulations were more efficient than each bacterial suspension. The most effective in reducing disease incidence was Pa (w) + RB. In contrast, Pa (m), Pa (m) + TAL, and Pa (m) + RB did not significantly suppress the disease in comparison with the infested control. Thus, phenazine production as a main biocontrol mechanism of P. aureofaciens (30-84) may be affected by the kind of carriers used for the bioformulation development.
