#ITI#Active substances used in plant protection in Poland after the European Union accession#FTI#
#IRE#In the years 2003-2009, a significant reduction of active substances of plant protection products was observed in Poland. The amount of active substances decreased from 340 in 2003 to 279 in 2009. The real difference proved to be much higher because some substances were being withdrawn, and at the same time, new ones were being introduced on the market. The reductions were observed in all groups of plant protection products. The biggest decrease took place in the case of insecticides, which also had a smaller than average number of registered formulations compared to herbicides and fungicides. Herbicides had the highest number of registered formulations per active substance, while fungicides were the only group where the average number of registered formulations per active substance had increased in the analyzed period.The main reason for the described changes was the European Union's review of active substances. Substances which could pose a risk for humans or the environment were withdrawn. This positively influenced overall safety. The changes, however, also gave rise to some problems which are noted. Particularly pressing in Poland, is the problem of minor crops protection.#FRE#
