#IRE#Global epidemics of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza have highlighted aspects that are crucial when considering effective and rapid control of animal diseases, including zoonoses. Experience has shown that without strong and well-governed veterinary services, effective surveillance and control can be challenging at best. For an effective response, veterinary services need access to expertise, resources, and appropriate legislation. Within its mandate to "improve animal health worldwide" the World Organisation for Animal Health is providing recommendations and taking action to improve the strength and governance of veterinary services worldwide.
