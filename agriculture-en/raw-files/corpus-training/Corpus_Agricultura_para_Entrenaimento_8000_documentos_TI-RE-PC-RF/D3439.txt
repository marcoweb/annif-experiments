#ITI#Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) tolerance to some post-emergence herbicides#FTI#
#IRE#Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) is a medicinal plant, but its cultivation is restricted by weed competition. Therefore, three rates (0.75X, 1X, and 1.25X, where X is equal to the recommended dose of haloxyfop-R (methyl ester), sethoxydim, oxadiargyl, bentazon, oxadiazon, and oxyfluorfen) were applied at the 3-4 leaf stages to valerian plants. This application was done to select the herbicide type and rate for post-controlling broadleaf and grasses weeds in this species. Herbicide injury, Soil-Plant Analyses Development (SPAD) reading, number of leaves per plant, stem diameter, and fresh and dry weights were determined 10, 20, and 30 days after herbicide application. Oxyfluorfen application caused the most herbicide injury followed by bentazon. Injury increased as the rate and the days after application increased. Oxadiazon only caused significant damage 30 days after application under all three rates. Other treatments showed no marked injuries under any rate or date after application, as compared with the control. Effects on other measured traits depended on the trait, herbicide, and herbicide rate. The highest SPAD, leaf number, shoot diameter, fresh weight and dry weight, was recorded under application of 30 mg a.i. kg-1 soil oxadiargyl and 90 mg a.i. kg-1 soil oxadiazon, 81 mg a.i. kg-1 soil haloxyfop-R, 37.5 mg a.i. kg-1 soil oxadiargyl, 22.5 mg a.i. kg-1 soil oxadiargyl, 81 mg a.i. kg-1 soil haloxyfop-R, and 81 mg a.i. kg-1 soil haloxyfop-R, respectively. To sum up, the results showed that sethoxydim, oxadiargyl, and haloxyfop-R produced no significant symptoms of phytotoxicity or reduction of measured traits. This means that oxadiargyl, haloxyfop-R, and sethoxydim may be used safely for weed control of valerian at the rates used in this experiment under similar conditions. © by Hassan Karimmojeni 2015.#FRE#
