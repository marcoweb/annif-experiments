#ITI#Effect of botanicals on infestation intensity of aceria guererronis keifer in coconut#FTI#
#IRE#The withdrawal of chemical pesticides opens up a new perspective to control pests through botanical extracts. The essential oils derived from various medicinal and aromatic plants proved to have antifungal, antibacterial and insecticidal properties. The present study is directed towards management of a dreaded pest of coconut i.e. eriophyid mite through exploitation of those properties of the plants. The efficacy of a botanical biocide formulated by using seven different aromatic and medicinal herbs against the infestation intensity of eriophyid mite was tested in the experiment at five different coconut farms in different coconut growing states of India. Four application of the formulated product resulted up to 72.17% damage reduction.#FRE#
