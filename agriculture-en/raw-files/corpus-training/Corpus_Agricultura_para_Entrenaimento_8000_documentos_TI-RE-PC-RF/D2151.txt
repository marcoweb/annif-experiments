#ITI#Limited benefits of summer cover crops on nitrogen cycling in organic vegetable production#FTI#
#IRE#Cover crops can improve internal nitrogen (N) cycling in agroecosystems while increasing crop yield, with mixtures potentially providing more benefits than monocultures. Cover crops may be especially useful for organic vegetable producers that have few options to meet crop N demand with certified organic products. We established a two-year experiment comparing the effects of five summer cover crop treatments–monocultures of Sunn hemp (SH) or Sorghum sudangrass (SSG), a SH-SSG mixture, and mixtures of 3 species (SH-SSG + buckwheat) or 5 species (SH-SSG + buckwheat, cowpea and sunflower)–on cover crop biomass production, soil N cycling, and yields of organic vegetables. Nitrogen concentrations were determined in the biomass of cover crops and cash crops, soils were sampled regularly for inorganic N and potential net N mineralization, and total soil N was measured at the beginning and end of the experiment. Partial N budgets were also computed. In both years, aboveground cover crop biomass was lowest in SSG (4,500–5,900 kg ha−1) and greatest in SH + SSG (7,600–9,200 kg ha−1). High cover crop biomass production led to large N quantities being returned to the soil (66–155 kg N ha−1), although this did not increase soil N availability and yields compared to plots without cover crops. Partial N budgets showed large N surpluses, with less than 20% of the N added with fertilizer recovered in harvested crops. Overall, these results suggest a small transfer of cover crop N to subsequent cash crops in organic vegetable production, resulting in limited benefits. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
