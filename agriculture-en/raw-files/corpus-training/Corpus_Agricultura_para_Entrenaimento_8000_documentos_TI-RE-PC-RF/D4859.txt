#ITI#Effect of coated plant extracts on Histomonas meleagridis and growth of bacteria in vitro#FTI#
#IRE#Three coated plant extracts (RepaXol® and two experimental formulations) were tested for their minimal lethal concentration for histomonads in vitro and the effect of those substances on the bacterial growth in the histomonadal culture. After 48 hr, RepaXol® and experimental formulation B were lethal to histomonads at a concentration of 1.25 μl/ml. Experimental formulation C was lethal at a concentration of 2.5 μl/ml. All products also decreased the growth of bacteria at concentrations inhibiting the growth of histomonads.#FRE#
