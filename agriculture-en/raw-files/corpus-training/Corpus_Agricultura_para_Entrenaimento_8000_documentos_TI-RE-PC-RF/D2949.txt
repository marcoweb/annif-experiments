#ITI#Exploring the use of legumes as host plant species in Glomus mosseae sporulation#FTI#
#IRE#The production of high quality, large scale, pathogen free and homogenous mycorrhizal inoculums are required for research purposes and soil bio-fertility. In the current study, a pot culture technique was followed to produce healthy quality and mass quantity of Glomus mosseae spores for research purposes. Five legumes plants were selected {(pea (Pisum sativum), broad bean, (Vicia faba) black eyed beans (Vigna unguiculata) soybean (Glycine max), and mung beans (Phaseolus aureus)}. The legumes were grown for two months under controlled conditions after pre-inoculated with healthy G. mosseae spores. The highest number of spores was counted in the mung beans rhizosphere and it was the best host in nodules weight production and root colonization rate. Soybeans produced the lowest spore’s number. It was found that the correlation between root colonization rate and spores number in the soil was positive. The rhizobium nodule weight was related positively with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spores manipulations in the soil. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
