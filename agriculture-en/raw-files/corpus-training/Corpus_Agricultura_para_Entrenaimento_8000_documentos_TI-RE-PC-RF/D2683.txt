#ITI#Automation of Seed Priming Technology for Enhanced Seed Vigour of Blackgram Seeds#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Seed priming technique involves soaking of seeds in priming agent to a point where germination related metabolic activities occur in the seeds followed by drying of imbibed seeds to original moisture to prevent the radical protrusion and facilitate storage of primed seed. Draining of priming agent and drying of large quantity of primed seeds is a laborious and time consuming process. The current study was aimed to standardize automation of seed priming process by utilizing house-hold top loading washing machine. Methods: The top loading washing machine referred to as Seed Priming Cabinet, contained a priming drum with provision for draining water. On completion of the soaking period, the ‘SPIN’ button was pressed by setting the duration of spin drying (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min.). Then the seeds were removed from the drum of priming cabinet and subjected to shade drying so as to reach the original moisture content and evaluated for seed quality parameters. Result: The blackgram seed subjected to conventional hydropriming was compared with automatic seed priming for 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 min. and observed that hydropriming and spin drying for 3 min. was found to be optimum and the per cent increase in germination recorded over control was 18.0 per cent thus suggesting that automation of seed priming technology can be recommended for enhanced seed vigour and crop productivity of blackgram. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
