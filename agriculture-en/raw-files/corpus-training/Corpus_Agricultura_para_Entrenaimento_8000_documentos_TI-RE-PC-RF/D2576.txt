#ITI#Management of dry root rot in chickpea (Cicer arietinum l.) caused by macrophomina phaseolina by utilizing host plant resistance, fungicides and bioagents#FTI#
#IRE#Background: For the management of soil borne disease like dry root rot of chickpea caused by Macrophomina phaseolina, by using fungicides alone is not feasible due to environmental and health hazards. Hence integrated management of the disease by using resistant varieties, fungicides and bio-control agents is the best alternative. So the present study was aimed to identify resistant varieties, best fungicide and bioagent for management of dry root rot in chickpea. Methods: Two hundred and twelve genotypes were screened using blotter paper technique for identifying resistant genotypes for dry root rot. The experiment on management of dry root rot was conducted during Kharif and Rabi of 2013-14 using a susceptible chickpea variety JG-11 with 14 treatments including control with 3 replications. Result: Of two hundred and twelve chickpea genotypes screened for host plant resistance against Macrophomina phaseolina by blotter paper technique only one genotype i.e. PBG-5 showed moderately resistant reaction. Among fourteen treatments including fungicides and bioagents imposed for the management of dry root rot, seed treatment with tebuconazole @ 2 g/kg recorded lowest per cent disease incidence of 9.43, with a highest yield of 722.81 kg/ha compared to untreated control which recorded the highest per cent disease incidence (40.10) with a lowest mean yield of 362.02 kg/ha.
