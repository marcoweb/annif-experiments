#ITI#Avian diseases: The creation and evolution of P. Philip levine's enduring gift#FTI#
#IRE#This account has two aims. The first is to provide a tribute to Dr. Pincus Philip Levine, the founder of Avian Diseases. It addresses several facets of the life and times of this remarkable and interesting personality, giving some insight into the why and how he came to establish the journal. It touches on his background; his character; his astute and searching mind; his ability to interact with others; his influence on veterinary, and especially avian, medicine; and his teaching genius and reveals the positive force he was in his interactions with others. Then, it turns to a celebration of the first half-century of the journal that he created, essentially single-handedly, and reviews some of the history regarding the stimulus, birthing pains, and gradual evolution of the journal through a succession of editors, business managers, and supporting casts to the publication that we see today, nearly 50 yr later.
