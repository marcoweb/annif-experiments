#ITI#Short-term carbon dioxide emissions and denitrification losses from soils amended with low-P manure from genetically modified pigs#FTI#
#IRE#Genetically modified pigs have been developed that are able to use phosphorus (P) in the feed more efficiently and thereby reduce the amount of P excreted in the manure. Improved digestibility would also change the chemical composition of the manure. The objective of this study was to determine how improved P digestibility affects the manure composition and the associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and nitrogen (N) loss through denitrification when the manure is applied to soil. Aerobic and anaerobic incubation studies were conducted to evaluate CO2 emissions and denitrification losses from two soils (Brookston clay loam and Harrow sandy loam) amended with pig slurry (115 mg N kg-1 soil) from transgenic pigs as well as from conventional pigs. In addition, both the transgenic and conventional pigs were fed either a low-P diet or a conventional P diet, and the effects of diet type on CO2 emissions and denitrification losses were examined. Carbon dioxide emissions were 17% lower (P < 0.05) in treatments amended with transgenic pig manure compared with conventional pig manure in the clay loam soil. However, denitrification losses were increased by 37% (P < 0.05) in the clay loam soil amended with manure from transgenic pigs compared to manure from conventional pigs. Neither CO2 emissions nor N loss through denitrification were affected by pig genotype when the manure was added to the sandy loam soil. The diet type (conventional P diet or low-P diet) did not affect either CO2 emissions or N losses through denitrification in either the Brookston clay loam or Harrow sandy loam soils.
