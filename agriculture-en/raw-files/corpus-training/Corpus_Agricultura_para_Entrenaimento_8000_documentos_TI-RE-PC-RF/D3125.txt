#ITI#Bioefficacy, Phytotoxicity and Economics of Post-emergence Herbicides in Moth Bean (Vigna aconitifolia) in Hot Arid Regions#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Weed infestation is the major cause of yield loss to Kharif pulses in arid regions. Post-emergence herbicide application is a promising weed management option for pulses in these areas. Therefore, the current study was aimed to find an effective and economic post-emergence herbicide molecule for weed control in moth bean. Methods: A field experiment was conducted during 2017-2019 with different herbicides, hand weeding, weed-free and unweededs in Kharif mung bean in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Result: Among the herbicide treatments, post-emergence application of propaquizafop + imazethapyr @ 125 g a.i. ha-1 being statistically at par with clodinafop-propargyl + sodium acifluorfen @ 312.5 g a.i. ha-1 and hand weeding recorded the highest reduction in total weed dry matter (73.9%), highest weed control efficiency (73.8%) and lowest weed persistence index (1.03) compared to the unweeded. The reduction in seed yield in unweeded compared to weed-free and hand weeding was 50.8% and 42.1%, respectively. As the imazethapyr-containing herbicides caused crop phytotoxicity, significantly higher crop dry weight (513 g m-2), seed yield (5.53 q ha-1), stover yield (18.0 q ha-1), gross returns and net benefits of moth bean were recorded with clodinafop-propargyl + sodium acifluorfen (312.5 g a.i. ha-1) over other herbicide treatments. Clodinafop-propargyl + sodium acifluorfen (@312.5 g a.i. ha-1) registered the minimum value of weed index (20) and highest values of herbicide efficiency index (3.9) and crop resistance index (4.70).
