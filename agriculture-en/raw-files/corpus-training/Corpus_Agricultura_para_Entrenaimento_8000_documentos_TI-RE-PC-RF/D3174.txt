#ITI#Prediction of storability in soybean seeds through accelerated ageing technique [Glycine max (L.) Merill]#FTI#
#IRE#An attempt was made to predict the relative storability of seeds of soybean varieties (JS-335 and DSB-21) through accelerated ageing technique in comparison with that of natural ageing where both the varieties had similar initial germination (93 %). The seeds were subjected to accelerated ageing conditions at 41oC temperature and 95 ± 5 per cent relative humidity up to 180 hours. While, for natural ageing, the seeds were packed in cloth bag with the initial moisture of 9.5 per cent and stored under ambient conditions. The experimental results revealed that with the subsequent increase in accelerated ageing duration from 24 hours onwards up to 180 hours, the seed quality parameters viz., seed germination percentage, mean germination time, seedling vigour index and dehydrogenase enzyme activity decreased significantly. While the electrical conductivity increased significantly. When the accelerated ageing results were compared with that of natural ageing, accelerated ageing for 132 hours (67 % germination) was nearly equal to nine months of natural ageing (69 % germination) in case of JS-335 whereas in DSB-21, 144 hours of accelerated ageing (70 % germination) was equal to nine months of natural ageing (70 % germination). Hence, the accelerated ageing test can be used to predict the relative storability of soybean seeds. Hence, the seed producers can take decision regarding which seed lot can be stored for longer time and which one should be immediately sold to the market without any compromise in seed quality. It also helps in taking other management decisions. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
