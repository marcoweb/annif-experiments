#ITI#Impact of some herbicides and cultural practices on weed and crop parameters in Kharif pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) millsp.]#FTI#
#IRE#Integration of pendimethalin pre emergence, quizalofop ethyl post emergence and oxadiargyl pre emergence with one hand weeding and one interculturing at 40 DAS proved effective in reducing total weed density and dry weight of weeds. The maximum yield and net return accured under weed-free closely followed by pendimethalin 900 g ha-1 as pre emergence followed by one hand weeding and one interculturing at 40 DAS, quizalofop ethyl 40 g ha-1 as post emergence followed by one hand weeding and one interculturing at 40 DAS and oxadiargyl 90 g ha-1 as pre emergence followed by one hand weeding and one interculturing at 40 DAS.#FRE#
