#ITI#Prevalence of vancomycin resistant enterococci on poultry farms established after the ban of avoparcin#FTI#
#IRE#Fecal samples from poultry on farms established after the ban of avoparcin (study farms) and from poultry on farms previously exposed to avoparcin (control farms) were examined for the presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The samples were collected during the autumn and winter of 2001-2002. One isolate from each positive sample was selected, identified to species level, and examined for the presence of the vanA gene. The concentration of VRE and generic enterococci in the samples were also determined. In addition, the susceptibility to the ionophoric coccidiostat narasin was examined in a number of enterococcal isolates from poultry and in some enterococci of porcine origin that had not been exposed to narasin. VanA-type VRE was detected in samples from 64% of the study farms and 96% of the control farms. However, the concentration of VRE in the control samples was about six times larger than in the samples from the study farms. The minimum inhibitory concentration values for narasin differed between the poultry (1-4 mg/liter) and the porcine (0.25-0.5 mg/liter) isolates, indicating a decreased susceptibility towards narasin among enterococci from poultry.#FRE#
