#ITI#Genotyping of newly isolated infectious bronchitis virus isolates from Northeastern Georgia#FTI#
#IRE#Sixteen infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) field isolates obtained from vaccinated commercial broiler chickens showing clinical respiratory disease were characterized by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of the hypervariable region of the S1 spike glycoprotein gene. The genetic relationship among these variants and reference strains was determined by phylogenetic analysis and use of the basic local alignment search tool. All the isolates formed a distinct phylogenetic group with very short branched distances, suggesting that isolates had a similar origin. All the isolates showed 85% amino acid identity with recently described Australian isolates, particularly N1-62. Given that little was known about this new emergent IBV we have characterized five field isolates by sequencing the entire S1 gene. Multiple sequence alignment of deduced amino acid sequences with commonly used vaccine strains revealed that most substitutions occurred in the 53-148 amino acid region. A possible recombination site with N1-62 isolate was identified between amino acid residues 115-121. All the field isolates shared four or five out of seven amino acid residues with N1-62 in this region as opposed to Ark-DPI and Mass 41 reference strains, which shared only two residues. Results indicate that IBV isolates reported here can be considered as new IBV genotype. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists 2010.#FRE#
