#ITI#Phenylalanine supply alleviates the drought stress in mustard (Brassica campestris) by modulating plant growth, photosynthesis, and antioxidant defense system#FTI#
#IRE#Mustard (Brassica campestris L.) is a major oilseed crop that plays a crucial role in agriculture. Nevertheless, a number of abiotic factors, drought in particular, significantly reduce its production. Phenylalanine (PA) is a significant and efficacious amino acid in alleviating the adverse impacts of abiotic stressors, such as drought. Thus, the current experiment aimed to evaluate the effects of PA application (0 and 100 mg/L) on brassica varieties i.e., Faisal (V1) and Rachna (V2) under drought stress (50% field capacity). Drought stress reduced the shoot length (18 and 17%), root length (12.1 and 12.3%), total chlorophyll contents (47 and 45%), and biological yield (21 and 26%) of both varieties (V1 and V2), respectively. Foliar application of PA helped overcome drought-induced losses and enhanced shoot length (20 and 21%), total chlorophyll contents (46 and 58%), and biological yield (19 and 22%), whereas reducing the oxidative activities of H2O2 (18 and 19%), MDA concentration (21 and 24%), and electrolyte leakage (19 and 21%) in both varieties (V1 and V2). Antioxidant activities, i.e., CAT, SOD, and POD, were further enhanced under PA treatment by 25, 11, and 14% in V1 and 31, 17, and 24% in V2. Overall findings suggest that exogenous PA treatment reduced the drought-induced oxidative damage and improved the yield, and ionic contents of mustard plants grown in pots. It should be emphasized, however, that studies examining the impacts of PA on open-field-grown brassica crops are still in their early stages, thus more work is needed in this area. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
