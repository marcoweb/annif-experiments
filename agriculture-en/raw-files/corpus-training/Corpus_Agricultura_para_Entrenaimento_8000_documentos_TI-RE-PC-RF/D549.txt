#ITI#Toxicity of emerging contaminant antibiotics in soil to Capsicum annuum L. growth and their effects on it accumulating copper#FTI#
#IRE#Antibiotics are a kind of emerging contaminant in soil. Tetracycline (TC) and oxytetracycline (OTC) in soil are often detected, even with very high concentration in the soils of facility agriculture due to their good effect, low price and large usage. Copper (Cu) is common heavy metal pollutant in soil. The toxicity roles of TC, OTC and/or Cu in soil on a commonly consumed vegetable Capsicum annuum L. and its Cu accumulation were not clear till now. The results of pot experiment showed that the TC or OTC added in soil alone didn't produce poison effects for C. annuum after 6 weeks and 12 weeks growth reflected by some physiological index like SOD, CAT and APX activities changes, while the biomass changes affirmed them either. Cu contaminated soil significantly inhibited the growth of C. annuum. Furthermore, combined pollution of Cu with TC or OTC was with more serious suppression of C. annuum growth. The suppression role of OTC was heavier than TC in Cu and TC or OTC contaminated soil. Such phenomenon was relevant with the role of TC or OTC increased Cu concentration in C. annuum. The improvement role of TC or OTC on Cu accumulation in C. annuum caused by the increased extractable Cu concentration in soil. The study demonstrated that TC or OTC added in soil alone was without any toxicity to C. annuum. But they may aggravate the hurt of C. annuum caused by Cu through increased its accumulation from soil. Thus, such combine pollution should be avoided in safe agricultural product. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
