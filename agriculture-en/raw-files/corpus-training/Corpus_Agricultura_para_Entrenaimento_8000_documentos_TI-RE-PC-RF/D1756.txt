#ITI#Improved fallow: growth and nitrogen accumulation of five native tree species in Brazil#FTI#
#IRE#Small-holding farmers of the Brazilian Amazon often use a rotation of secondary forest, slash-and-burn land-clearing and fallow phase regeneration for agriculture. In recent decades reduction of the fallow phase from ~20 to ~5 years has limited nutrient accumulation by fallow vegetation to sustain future crop growth. Slash-and-mulch and improved fallow schemes, including use of native nitrogen-fixing species, have been investigated to address the issue. In the current study in eastern Amazonia of Brazil, a 7-year old forest site was slash-and-mulched and four treatments applied; no fertilizer and no N-fixer as the control; no fertilizer with N-fixer; P + K fertilizer with no N-fixer; P + K fertilizer with N-fixer. Manioc was planted in all plots at establishment. After manioc harvest and 4 years of fallow, a total of 6 years after planting, use of P + K fertilizer increased tree growth of four of five planted species. In the presence of the N-fixer I. edulis, trends of increased growth and survival among these four tree species were observed. After 6 years, fertilization with P + K significantly increased tree volume and biomass. The N-fixer lowered survival of other species yet increased estimated N uptake of planted trees. Use of P + K fertilizer without N-fixer might allow for commercial harvest of S. amazonicum at the end of one 7-year crop-fallow cycle without jeopardizing agroecosystem N stocks. Use of P + K fertilizer in the presence of I. edulis can increase planted-tree N-content but increases in competition may limit commercial harvest yet may better sustain future food crop growth. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
