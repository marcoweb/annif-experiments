#ITI#Falling water tables in a sloping/nonsloping aquifer under various initial water table profiles#FTI#
#IRE#An analytical solution for the Boussinesq equation using Werner method of linearization have been obtained to describe falling water table between two parallel drains installed at sloping/nonsloping aquifer for flat, parabola and elliptical initial water table profiles. Midpoints of falling water table between parallel drains obtained from proposed analytical solutions for these initial conditions were compared with both the laboratory and field data. Midpoint water tables obtained from various solutions for nonsloping aquifer were also compared with the result obtained from Boussinesq exact solution using parameters of a drainage experimental site. Tchebycheff norm was used to rank the performance of the proposed solutions. It was observed that the proposed analytical solution for elliptical initial water table profile provides a better result as compared to other solutions and found to be more realistic in modeling the falling water profile.#FRE#
