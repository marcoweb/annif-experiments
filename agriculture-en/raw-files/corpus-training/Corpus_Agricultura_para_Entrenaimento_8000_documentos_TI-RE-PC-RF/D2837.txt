#ITI#Priming seed mitigates the effects of saline stress in soybean seedlings#FTI#
#IRE#Seed germination and seedling growth are the most sensitive plant stages towards salinity. Various techniques can improve emergence and stand formation under salt conditions. Seeds priming is one of the most frequently used technique. Seed priming could develop different defence mechanisms of seeds against salinity stress. This experiment aims to examine the seed priming into potassium nitrate-KNO3 (1%), ascorbic acid – ASA (100mgl≤1) and potassium chloride-KCl (1%) solutions, that may reduce harmful effects of salinity stress. Salinity was imposed by treatment of seeds with different concentrations of NaCl [0 (control), 50, 100, 200m MNaCl]. All data were analysed statistically by three-way ANOVA. Individual testing of probability was carried out using Tukey’s method p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤ 0.01. Correlation dependence was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Test results demonstrated positive effect of seed priming. This was showed by improved soybean seed quality and increased seed germination rate. The intensity of lipid peroxidation, free proline concentration and Na+ was decreased, while K+ in seedlings increased due to priming treatment. Priming of seeds into ASA solution resulted in increased vitamin C concentration, while priming into KNO3 and ΚCl solutions reduced the content of vitamin C in soybean seedlings. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
