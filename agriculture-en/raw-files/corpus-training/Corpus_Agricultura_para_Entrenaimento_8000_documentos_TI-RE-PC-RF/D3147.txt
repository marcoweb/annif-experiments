#ITI#AMMI & GGE biplot analysis of multi environment yield trial of soybean in North Western Himalayan state Uttarakhand of India#FTI#
#IRE#The investigation was carried out to study Genotype × Environment (G×E) interaction for seed yield in 36 soybean genotypes including check PS1092 over 3 diverse environments represented by different altitudes in Uttarakhand. Grain yield performances of soybean genotypes were evaluated during Kharif 2013 season using a randomized complete block design. The AMMI analysis indicated that environment, genotypes and genotype by environment interactions had significantly affected seed yield and accounted for 9.76, 28.97 and 47.55% of the total variation, respectively. GGE biplot clearly displayed interrelationships between test locations as well as genotypes and facilitated visual comparisons based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The first two principal components PCI and PCII were used to create a two-dimensional GGE biplot that accounted for 45.68 and 38.88% variations respectively and based on discriminating and representative ability, E2 (Majhera) was most suitable location for selecting generally adapted genotypes. Soybean genotype C1 (PS1539) was identified as ideal genotype with high yield and low G×E interaction i.e. high stability. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
