#ITI#Furfural Approaches as Control Measures against Root Rot and Root-Knot Incidence of Tomato under Greenhouse and Field Conditions#FTI#
#IRE#The fungicidal and nematicidal activity of an emulsifiable formulation of furfural [2-furancarboxaldehyde] against root rot and root-knot pathogens was studied in laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments. The linear growth of tested soilborne pathogenic fungi was dramatically reduced with the increasing of furfural concentrations added to the growth medium up to 4 000 ppm where no growth was observed, while the bacterial and fungal bioagents showed more tolerance to these concentrations and failed to grow at 6 000 and 7 000 ppm, respectively. Pot and field experiments indicated that furfural at 6 000 ppm combined with bioagent treatments proved to have superior suppressive effect against tomato root rot incidence, caused by Fusarium solani and Rhizoctonia solani, comparing with each individual treatment. Numbers of nematodes in soil declined sharply in direct response to furfural application with the sharpest reductions in its population. No symptoms of root-knot incidence, caused by Meloidogyne incognita as well as no detected galls and eggmasess were observed in the root system of tomato plants grown in either artificially or naturally infested soil with the parasite at the same concentration under greenhouse and field conditions. Results from these experiments indicate that a variety of effective broad-spectrum formulations of furfural can be developed for control of economically important soilborne pests. © 2008, Versita.
