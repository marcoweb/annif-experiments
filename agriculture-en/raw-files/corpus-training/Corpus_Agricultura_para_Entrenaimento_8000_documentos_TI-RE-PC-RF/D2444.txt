#ITI#Response of pulses to varied levels of farm yard manure#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted at Zonal Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station, Shivamogga for three years, during kharif season of 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 to study the effect of varied levels of FYM on yield and economics of pulses (viz., black gram, green gram, cowpea and field bean). The pooled yield of three years was significantly higher with FYM application @ 10.0t ha-1 in black gram (743 kg ha-1) and green gram (664 kg ha-1) while it was with 7.5 t ha-1 in field bean (655 kg ha-1) and 5.0 t ha-1 in cowpea (1527 kg ha-1) over no FYM treatment. However, higher net returns of Rs. 13,013, Rs. 10,366, Rs. 40,368 and Rs. 13,856 was noticed with FYM application @ 10.0, 7.5, 5.0 and 2.5 t ha-1 for black gram, field bean, cowpea and green gram, respectively.
