#ITI#Integrated weed management in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) under rainfed conditions of Karnataka, India#FTI#
#IRE#A field investigation was carried out during winter seasons of 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 at Agricultural Research Station, Gulbarga (Karnataka) to evaluate the effect of pre and post emergence herbicides on weeds and productivity of chickpea cv. JG-11. Ten treatments were tested in randomized block design with three replications. Among the herbicidal treatments, pendimethalin 38% CS 0.75 kg a.i ha-1PE + hand weeding (HW) at 30-35 days after sowing (DAS) and pendimethalin 30% EC 0.75 kg a.i ha-1+ imazethapyr 2% 1.0 kg a.i ha-1 PE + one hoeing at 30-35 DAS recorded significantly higher seed yield (1198 kg ha-1), net returns (Rs. 25107 ha-1) and B:C ratio (2.10) and lower weed dry weight (11.3 g m-2) and higher weed control efficiency (83%) than all other herbicidal treatments except two hand weedings at 20 and 40 DAS. It may be inferred from the present investigation that these herbicidal treatments could be used effectively as an alternative for controlling weeds and obtaining optimum seed yield of chickpea under rainfed conditions of Karnataka.
