#ITI#Impact of PH (Hydrogen Ion Concentration) on Efficacy of Endosulfan 0.07% Against Spodoptera Litura#FTI#
#IRE#The bio-efficacy of endosulfan 0.07% with different quality of water as spray fluid was studied against different larval instars of Spodoptera. litura in laboratory condition. Among the four different quality of water, rain water and river water as spray fluid proved to be most effective while sea water as spray fluid resulted in low per cent mortality in different instars of S. litura, due to of acidic medium and a high electrical conductivity which adversely affected the physical properties and bio-efficacy of endosulfan.
