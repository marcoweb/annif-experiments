#ITI#Survival of Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale in sterilized poultry litter#FTI#
#IRE#Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT) has been associated with respiratory disease, increased mortality, retarded growth, and decreased egg production in chickens and turkeys. Surveillance of exposure to ORT infection in the field has shown that prevalence of the infection is higher during winter months. The ability of ORT to remain viable in the poultry litter was studied at different temperatures over time. Presterilized poultry litter was inoculated with 1011 colony-forming units of ORT and kept at -12 C, 4 C, 22 C, 37 C, and 42 C. Reisolation and titration of ORT from litter was attempted at intervals. Results indicate that ORT survived for 1 day at 37 C, 6 days at 22 C, 40 days at 4 C, and at least 150 days at -12 C. ORT did not survive 24 hr at 42 C. The survival of ORT at lower temperatures may be associated with the higher incidence of ORT infection in poultry during winter months.#FRE#
