#ITI#Effects of planting density on pod development and yield of peanuts under the pattern of precision planted peanuts#FTI#
#IRE#Understanding the effects of different sowing patterns and densities on plant growth characters and yield of peanut is essential for the design and adjustment of management practices that allow improvement and stabilization of peanut production. In the present study, Arachis hypogaea L. cv. Luhua 11 was used to determine the effects of planting density on pod development and yield of peanuts under the mode of single seeded precision sowing through field experiments. The results showed that an appropriate precision sowing density of 195,000-225,000 per hectare leads to an optimal pod number to produce pods, with dry matter accumulation resulting in significantly increased pod yield and harvest index(HI). When the same area sowing seed number of 255,000 per hectare, the kernel yield, pod yield, and HI per plant of the single seeded precision sowing method were higher than those of the double seeded precision sowing method.
