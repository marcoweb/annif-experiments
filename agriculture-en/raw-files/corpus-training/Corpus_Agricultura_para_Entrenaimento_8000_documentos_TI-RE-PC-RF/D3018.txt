#ITI#In-vivo and field evaluation of spinetoram 12 SC against Lampides boeticus on pigeonpea#FTI#
#IRE#The young larvae of L. boeticus damage flowers and pods. A new biological insecticide molecule, spinetoram 12 SC was evaluated for acute toxicity on greenhouse environment reared L. boeticus and persistence on pigeonpea pods at laboratory; and effect on L. boeticus on pigeonpea at field conditions during 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. Acute toxicity studies revealed that LC50‘s of spinetoram on third instar larvae after 24, 48 and 72 hours after treatment were 6.71, 2.23 and 1.28 ppm respectively. In persistence studies, spinetoram 12 SC 27 g a.i./ha was upto 11 DAT and 14 DAT for spinetoram 12 SC 36 and 45 g a.i./ha. More than 50 per cent mortality was observed in spinetoram 12 SC at 45 g a.i./ha upto 9 DAT, spinetoram 12 SC at 27 and 36 g a.i./ha, spinosad 45 SC 78 g a.i./ha and emamectin benzoate 5 SG at 11 g a.i./ha upto 7 DAT, monocrotophos 36 SL at 500 g a.i./ha upto 5 DAT, respectively. Results indicated that spinetoram 12 SC was significantly effective at 36 and 45 g a.i./ha when sprayed thrice at 15 days interval and minimized the incidence of L. boeticus on pigeonpea plants and increases the grain yield. All the spinetoram doses did not show any phytotoxic symptoms on pigeonpea plants. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
