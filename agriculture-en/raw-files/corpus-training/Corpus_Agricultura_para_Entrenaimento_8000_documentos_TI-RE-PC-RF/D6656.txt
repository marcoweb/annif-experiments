#ITI#Evaluation and application of DRAINMOD in an Australian sugarcane field#FTI#
#IRE#DRAINMOD is a water management model developed to simulate the performance of drainage and water table control systems for shallow water table soils, and it has been widely used in the United States over the last 20 years. This model has been evaluated and applied for predicting water table fluctuations in a sugarcane field for acid drainage management in north-eastern New South Wales, Australia. The reliability of the model has been evaluated using 2-year experimental field data from water level recorders installed in a sugarcane field. Good agreement was found between the observed and simulated values with a standard error of about 0.07 m. However, the model is not readily applicable to daily water management in Australian soils since it requires extensive soil and climate data, which are normally not available for most Australian sugarcane areas. In this application, refinements have been attempted in evapotranspiration estimation and in soil input data preparation so that the model requires only easily obtainable input data but still retains acceptable accuracy. With these improvements, the model can be used as a practical tool for investigating drainage management options for different site conditions. This will assist decision-makers in providing appropriate subsurface drainage management policies, such as acid drainage management, in Australian estuarine sugarcane areas. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.
