#ITI#Effect of Integrated Nutrient Management on Yield Attributes and Yield of Black Gram Cv. Pu-31#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The main pulses grown in India are chickpea, arhar, lentil, black gram, mung bean, moth bean, horse gram, pea, khesari, cowpea, etc. Black gram is fourth major pulse crop in India, that contributes 13 and 10 per cent of total area and production respectively. This is annual plant that attains 30-100 cm height and its stem is covered with brown hairs and much branched from the base. The pods are long and cylindrical being 5-6 cm length and 4-10 seed in pods. The seeds are generally black, very dark brown. Methods: The field experiment was conducted in kharif-2019 at research farm of Tirhut College of Agriculture Dholi, to study the effect of integrated nutrient management on growth, yield parameters and the yield of black gram cv-PU-31, by the use different sources of nutrient in a integrated manner such as three level of fertilizer i.e. F1-75, F2-100 and F3-125% RDF and two levels of organic manure i.e. M1-control and M2-FYM @ 5 t ha-1 and three levels of biofertilizer i.e., B1-rhizobium, B2-nutrient mobilizer, B3-rhizobium+ nutrient mobilizer. The treatments were allocated in randomized block design (factorial) and replicated thrice. Result: The results revealed that F3 produced taller plants, more dry matter, crop growth rate (CGR) yield attributes resulting higher yield of grain and straw (10.78, 22.61 q ha-1 respectively) which was statistically at par with plant height, dry matter, crop growth rate, yield attributes and yield of grain, straw and highest harvest index (10.73, 22.20 q ha-1 and 32.58% respectively) to F2. Among addition of organic manure significantly maximum plant height, dry matter and crop growth rate and yield attributes resulting maximum yield of grain, straw and harvest index (11.2, 22.79 q ha-1 and 33.31% respectively) was found in M2 over M1. In biofertilizer treatments, B3 recorded higher plant height, dry matter and crop growth rate, yield attributes resulting in significantly higher yield of grain, straw and harvest index (10.26, 21.90 q ha-1 and 31.92% respectively) over B1 and B2.
