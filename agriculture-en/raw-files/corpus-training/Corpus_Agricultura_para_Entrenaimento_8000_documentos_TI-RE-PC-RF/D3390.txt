#ITI#Effect of epicuticular waxes from triticale on the feeding behaviour and mortality of the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)#FTI#
#IRE#Surface waxes from wax-covered triticale plants (RAH 122) were sprayed on plants of the waxless genotype RAH 366 or the surface waxes were used to make artificial diet preparations. The results were significant increases in the mortality of apterous adults of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) at all concentrations tested in comparison with those aphids which fed on the control plants or aphids which were reared on the diets. In the choice tests, most aphids settled on plants without surface waxes or on diet preparations which did not have surface waxes (the controls). When the concentration of the surface waxes was increased on one of the plants or surface waxes were increased in the diet preparation, the number of wandering aphids increased. Those aphids which did not wander were mainly on the waxless control plants or on the waxless diet preparations. Aphids did settle on those plants or on the diet preparations which had 100 and 1,000 μg · g-1 of surface wax. The aphids rarely settled on the diet preparations containing 10,000 μg ·g-1 of surface waxes. From these observations it appears that surface waxes can act as a feeding deterrent. Since aphids on plants with surface waxes, or aphids which settled on diet preparations with surface waxes, started to die earlier than aphids fed only the control plants or the control diet preparations, it is possible that the surface waxes had a toxic effect that led to early mortality. Thus, it can be said that the surface waxes caused feeding deterrence and had a toxic effect on the aphids. © by Agnieszka Wójcicka 2016.#FRE#
