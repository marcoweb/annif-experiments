#ITI#Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of the bZIP gene family in Betula platyphylla and the functional characterization of BpChr04G00610 under low-temperature stress#FTI#
#IRE#The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) gene, which plays a significant role in the regulation of tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses, has been characterized in many plant species. Betula platyphylla is a significant afforestation species. To elucidate the stress resistance mechanism of birch, previous studies identified some stress resistance genes. However, the genome-wide identification and characterization of bZIP gene family in the birch have not been reported. Here, the 56 BpbZIP genes were identified and classified into 13 groups in birch. Cis-element analysis showed that the promoters of 56 family genes contained 108 elements, of which 16 were shared by 13 groups. There were 8 pairs of fragment repeats and 1 pair of tandem repeats, indicating that duplication may be the major reason for the amplification of the BpbZIP gene family. Tissue-specific of BpbZIP genes showed 18 genes with the highest expression in roots, 15 in flowers, 11 in xylem and 9 in leaves. In addition, five differentially expressed bZIP genes were identified from the RNA-seq data of birch under low-temperature stress, and the co-expressed differentially expressed genes were further screened. The analysis of gene ontology (GO) enrichment of each co-expression regulatory network showed that they were related to membrane lipids and cell walls. Furthermore, the transient overexpression of BpChr04G00610 decreased the ROS scavenging ability of birch under low-temperature stress, suggesting that it may be more sensitive to low-temperature. In conclusion, this study provides a basis for the study of the function of BpbZIP genes. Â© 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
