#ITI#Lethal effects of Spinosad on Chrysoperla carnea larvae (Neuroptera: Chrisopidae) under laboratory conditions#FTI#
#IRE#The use of selective insecticides could improve conservation of natural enemies and therefore contribute to the success of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs. In this study, the toxicity of one selective insecticide, Spinosad to common green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea Stephens was evaluated. Several stages of C. carnea larvae were exposed to Spinosad under laboratory conditions. The used quantities of Spinosad were less than the maximum recommended rate given on the product label. In contact bioassay tests, a direct relationship was detected between the concentration of Spinosad and mortality rate of first instar larvae. So that, the employing of 250 and 2 500 ppm of Spinosad caused 33 and 67 per cent mortality, respectively. Mortality rate was recorded 1-3 day post treatment. In implementation of 250 ppm of Spinosad on second and third instar larvae showed negligible mortality rate after 3 days whereas the first instars larvae suffered 33 per cent mortality. On the basis of collected data we could conclude that Spinosad is not to be considered to have an environmental safety profile on C. carnea similarly to well established biological insecticides.#FRE#
