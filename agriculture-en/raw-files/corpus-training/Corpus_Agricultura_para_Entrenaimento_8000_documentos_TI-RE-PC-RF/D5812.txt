#ITI#Characterization of the mating system of a native perennial tetraploid herb, Silene stellata#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the Study: Nursery pollination systems can range from obligate to facultative. In a system where generalists provide substantial pollination service, an important question is whether the cost of seed predation outweighs the benefit provided by the nursery pollinator to cause the plant to evolve toward more generalized pollination. Using a facultative system native to North America, we tested whether nursery pollinator vs. strictly mutualistic generalists affect mating-system parameters of the host plant and explored the implications for long-term coevolution. Methods: We used paternity analyses with 11 microsatellite markers to characterize the mating system of Silene stellata when pollination service is primarily through the nursery pollinator Hadena ectypa and generalist moths. Key Results: Our experimental population of S. stellata was predominantly outcrossing (average outcrossing rate t = 0.83), and mating-system parameters were similar between pollinator groups. We detected significant correlations in both selfing and outcrossed paternity at the fruit and maternal family level, corresponding to limited pollen dispersal (mean = 3.9 m). Among individuals, variation in anther–stigma separation was positively associated with outcrossing rate, which suggests the importance of herkogamy in preventing selfing. Conclusions: Correlated paternity suggests that seeds from the same fruit and/or plants are sired by a limited number of pollen donors, resulting from low pollen dispersal and potential male–male competition. The similar mating-system parameters of the two pollinator groups suggest that selection for higher outcrossing in S. stellata is likely to be through floral design rather than through increased pollinator specialization with H. ectypa. © 2018 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
