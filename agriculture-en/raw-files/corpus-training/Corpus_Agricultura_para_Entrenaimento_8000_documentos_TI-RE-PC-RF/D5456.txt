#ITI#Cecal Colonization of Chicks by Bovine-Derived Strains of Campylobacter#FTI#
#IRE#Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli strains were isolated from feces of dairy cattle at farms with no known problem due to campylobacteria. Farms were located in the northeast, desert southwest, and Pacific west. Twenty isolates were identified by ribotyping with a RiboPrinter.Â® The ability of these bovine isolates to colonize the ceca of chicks was determined by challenge inoculation and reisolation of the challenge strain from the ceca at 1 and 2 wk after challenge. Isolates recovered from chick ceca were examined by ribotyping to assure they matched the challenge strain. One hundred percent of the bovine-derived challenge strains were capable of colonizing chicks. These results indicate that dairy cattle may be asymptomatic Campylobacter carriers and potential sources of campylobacteria contamination of poultry facilities.#FRE#
