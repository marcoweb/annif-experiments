#ITI#Determining crop-water production functions using yield-irrigation gradient algorithms#FTI#
#IRE#Crop-water production functions (CWPFs) are a useful tool for irrigation planning, but derivation of CWPFs by field experimentation is expensive, and traditional analytical techniques are not well suited to derivation of CWPFs. Physiologically based crop models provide a useful tool for simulation of agricultural experiments, but they have not been extensively applied to the task of CWPF determination. A new algorithm type based upon differential crop yield response to irrigation ("yield-irrigation gradients" [YIG]) is presented that uses these crop models to determine planning-level irrigation schedules and CWPFs. Three specific algorithms are developed within this type, varying in complexity, performance, and computational costs. Performance of the YIG methods is compared against a standard reference evapotranspiration method. In particular, the randomized iterative YIG (RIYIG) algorithm provides near-optimal results but at the highest computational costs of all the methods specified. All of the techniques presented have general applicability and are not limited to any one crop or location. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
