#ITI#The onset of xylogenesis in Smith fir is not related to outer bark thickness#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: The resumption of stem growth varies across the ontogenetic development of trees. Compared with younger trees, older ones have thicker outer bark with a temperature-insulating effect that could potentially prevent the stem from warming in the spring. However, the question of whether xylogenesis in old trees is influenced by the thick bark still remains unresolved. Methods: We investigated the onset of xylogenesis across the ontogenetic development of Smith fir (Abies georgei var. smithii) trees in the Sygera Mountains, southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The outer bark of older trees was also removed. Xylogenesis was monitored in microcores we collected every 3 days during May and June in 2017. Results: Xylogenesis began in late May in young (<50 yr) and mature (50–100 yr) trees, 1 week earlier than in adult (>100–150 yr) and old (>150–200 yr) trees. Older (>200 yr) trees had the latest onset of xylogenesis, 2 weeks after young trees. The resumption of xylogenesis was similar between the control and bark-removed trees. Conclusions: Growth resumption was delayed in older and bigger trees. Outer bark did not affect the onset of xylogenesis, which indicated that the delayed resumption of growth during the lifespan of trees could be more related to endogenous factors than to an insulating effect of the thick bark of older individuals. © 2019 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
