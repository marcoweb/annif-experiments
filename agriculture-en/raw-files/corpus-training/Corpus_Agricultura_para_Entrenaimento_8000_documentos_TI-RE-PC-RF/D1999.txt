#ITI#Enhanced UV-B radiation reduced soil-soybean ecosystem respiration and nitrous oxide emissions#FTI#
#IRE#To gain insight into enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation effects on agroecosystem respiration rates and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, pot and field experiments were conducted in the 2004 and 2006 soybean-growing seasons, respectively. The enhanced UV-B radiation treatments were simulated by a 20% increase in its intensity. The respiration rates and N2O fluxes were measured by a static opaque chamber-gas chromatograph method. Results showed that the enhanced UV-B radiation did not change the seasonal patterns of ecosystem respiration and N2O emission. Compared to the controls, however, the enhanced UV-B reduced the respiration rates by 43.3% (P = 0.015) and 44.8% (P = 0.002) over the entire soybean-growing seasons in 2004 and 2006, respectively. Similarly, the enhanced UV-B radiation reduced seasonal N2O emissions by 33.5% (P = 0.023) and 42.4% (P = 0.006) in 2004 and 2006, respectively. Our findings suggest that enhanced UV-B radiation may lead to a decrease in agroecosystem respiration rates and N2O emissions from croplands. To estimate the overall effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on greenhouse gas emissions from agroecosystems, nevertheless, more field measurements deserve to be carried out in various cropping systems.
