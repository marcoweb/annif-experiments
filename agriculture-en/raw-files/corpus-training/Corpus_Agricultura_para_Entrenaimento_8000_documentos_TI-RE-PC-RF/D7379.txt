#ITI#Effect of farmers’ management on movable sprinkler solid-set systems#FTI#
#IRE#Farmer's management is considered a key factor for efficient, cost-effective irrigation. In this study, the effect of proper irrigation management in the solid-set systems of Kurdistan province in Iran was investigated. Performance indices including Coefficient of Uniformity (CU), Potential Application Efficiency of the Low Quarter (PELQ), Wind Drift and Evaporation Loss (WDEL), Adequacy of Irrigation (ADirr), Deep Percolation Losses (DP), and Application Efficiency (AE) were measured in ten different local plots in 2007 and 2017. The performance of selected systems remained similar in 2007 and 2017. The management of the plots evaluated in 2017 was modified, taking into account the preliminary design considerations and applying changes such as irrigation scheduling and sprinkler type. These plots with improved management were re-evaluated. Results showed that CU and PELQ were improved by 29% and 82%, respectively, in all systems. In addition, deep percolation losses (DP) were reduced by more than 40%. Insufficient training for farmers and the use of unskilled labor are of the main reasons for sustained underperformance in the study area. Actions are required in farmers’ education and in public performance monitoring. Additionally, the results of this research have shown that management improvement measurements are urgently required for the satisfactory performance of the above-mentioned systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
