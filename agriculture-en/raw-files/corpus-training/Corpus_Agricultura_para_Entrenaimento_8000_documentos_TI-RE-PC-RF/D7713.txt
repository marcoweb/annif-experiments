#ITI#Effects of water application intensity, drop size and water application amount on the characteristics of topsoil pores under sprinkler irrigation#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were carried out to study the effects of sprinkler irrigation on the characteristics of topsoil pores. Total soil porosity, capillary porosity, air-space porosity and porosities of different pore shapes were analyzed using images analysis of thin sections of soil samples. The experimental treatments included five water application intensities (5.3, 7.7, 11.0, 15.0 and 20.7 mm/h), five drop diameters (0.76, 1.28, 1.92, 3.18, 4.19 mm) and five water application amounts (9.0, 23.6, 37.5, 49.6, 59.4 mm). The compounding sprinkler system was used in the experiments of water application intensity and single sprinkler was used in the experiments of drop size and water application amount. The total porosity, air-space porosity and porosities of elongated pores have the similar decreasing tendency and pattern when water application intensity, drop diameter or water application amount increase. Capillary porosity, porosities of round and irregular pores have no obvious changing tendency. The decreasing porosities of the elongated pores and macropores are the main reasons for the decreasing of total porosity under sprinkler irrigation. To maintain soil structure in good conditions, the reasonable parameters would be considered for water application intensity, drop diameter and water application amount. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.
