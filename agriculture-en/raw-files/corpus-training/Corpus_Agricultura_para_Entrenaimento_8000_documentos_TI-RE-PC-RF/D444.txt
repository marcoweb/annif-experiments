#ITI#A NAC transcription factor ZaNAC93 confers floral initiation, fruit development, and prickle formation in Zanthoxylum armatum#FTI#
#IRE#Zanthoxylum armatum is a dioecious prickly plant which developed apomictic reproduction. The increases in male flowers and prickle density in female plants lead to low yield and picking efficiency. However, little is known concerning the mechanisms of floral development and prickle formation. NAC is a well-known transcription factor that participates in multiple aspects of plant growth and development. Herein, we characterize the functions and regulatory mechanisms of candidate NACs controlling both traits in Z. armatum. A total of 159 ZaNACs were identified, and 16 of these were male-biased, represented by the NAP subfamily members ZaNAC93 and ZaNAC34, orthologs of AtNAC025 and AtNARS1/NAC2 respectively. Overexpression of ZaNAC93 in tomato led to modifications in flower and fruit development, including earlier flowering, increased numbers of lateral shoots and flowers, accelerated plant senescence, and reduced size and weight of fruits and seeds. In addition, the trichome density in leaves and inflorescences was dramatically reduced in ZaNAC93-OX lines. Overexpression of ZaNAC93 resulted in the up-/downregulation of genes associated with GA, ABA and JA signaling pathways, such as GAI, PYL and JAZ, as well as several TFs, including bZIP2, AGL11, FBP24 and MYB52. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that ZaNAC93 protein could interact with AP1, GAI, bZIP2 and AGL11 in Z. armatum, which might contribute to floral induction, fruit growth, and trichome initiation. This work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of ZaNAC93 in reproductive development and prickle formation in Z. armatum. Â© 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
