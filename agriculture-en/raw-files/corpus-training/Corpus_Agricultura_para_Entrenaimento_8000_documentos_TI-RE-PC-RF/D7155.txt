#IRE#Frequency and depth of irrigation play crucial role in crop yield and use efficiency of water resource. To test this hypothesis a field study was carried out in November to January of 2001-2002 to 2003-2004 on a sandy loam (Aeric haplaquept) for quantifying the frequency and depth of irrigation on growth, curd yield (CY) and water use pattern of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis). Four irrigation frequencies depending on the attainment of cumulative pan evaporation (CPE) values of: 25 (CPE25), 31(CPE31), 38 (CPE38) and 45 (CPE45) mm were placed in main-plots, with three depth of irrigation (IW) of 35 (IW35), 30 (IW30) and 25 (IW25) mm in sub-plots. Water use efficiency (WUE), net evapotranspiration efficiency (WUEET) and irrigation water use efficiency (WUEI) were computed. Marginal water use efficiency (MWUE) and elasticity of water productivity (EWP) were calculated using the relationship between CY and seasonal actual evapotranspiration (SET). A continuous increasing trend in growth parameters, yield and WUEI was recorded with the increase in SET from CPE45-IW25 to CPE31-IW30. However with further increase in SET the same decreased up to CPE25-IW35 regime. Highest WUE and WUEET obtained under CPE38-IW35 regime where SET value was 5% lower than the status of SET under CPE31-IW30. This study confirmed that critical levels of SET needed to obtain maximum curd yield or WUE, could be obtained more precisely from the knowledge of MWUE and EWP. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.
