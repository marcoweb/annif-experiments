#ITI#Molecular characterization of contaminating infectious anemia virus of chickens in live commercial vaccines produced in the 1990s#FTI#
#IRE#The presence of infectious chicken anemia virus (CAV) was detected in a previous study by nested-PCR as a contaminant in seven commercial vaccines, produced in the 1990s by three different manufacturers, prepared against the most relevant virus etiologies. In order to phylogenetically characterize the genome and compare it to CAV isolates from Brazil and other parts of the world, sequences of approximately 675 bp of the gene encoding the hypervariable region of VP1 protein of three CAV vaccine contaminant strains were studied. The CAV genome in contaminated vaccines showed high similarity (>98.9%) with the Brazilian BR91/99 and Argentinian ArgA001028 (>99%) strains. However, the comparison with the Cuxhaven-1 vaccine strain showed a lower identity of between 96.8% and 97.7%, and comparing it with the CAV26P4 vaccine strain showed an identity between 97.2% and 98.2%; both are available in Brazil. Such differences might be relevant for the highly conserved CAV genome. CAV contaminants were positioned in the same genetic group (clusters) with the Brazilian strain BR91/99 and Argentinian strain ArgA001028. Results indicated that the contamination of live vaccines by CAV may have influenced CAV epidemiology in the Brazilian and Argentinian poultry industry.
