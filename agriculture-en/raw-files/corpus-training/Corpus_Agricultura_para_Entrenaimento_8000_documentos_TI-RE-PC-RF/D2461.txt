#ITI#Biochemical and molecuar marker based screening of seed longevity in soybean [Glycine max (L.) merill]#FTI#
#IRE#The soybean seed is highly susceptible to field weathering and mechanical damage which adversely affect its longevity. Mechanical injury can occur at any time during harvesting, drying and storage conditioning of seeds. The seed coat color and leachate conductivity of soybean has been correlated with seed longevity and black seed coat color has been reported to be positively correlated with better seed longevity. In order to understand the physico-chemical attributes related to soybean seed longevity, biochemical and molecular analysis of the parents exhibiting black (Birsasoya-1) and yellow seed coat colour (EC 241780) and the eleven F3 progenies of the cross exhibiting brown, yellow and black seed coat colour was carried out. The results revealed that vita-E, lignin, calcium content and activity of antioxidative enzymes appeared to be positively correlated with soybean seed longevity and levels were higher in black and brown seed coat color progenies. The lipid peroxidation rate was inversely related to membrane injury caused by ROS and comparatively much less lipid peroxidation rate was recorded in black and brown seed coat colour parents and progenies having better seed longevity. The SSR primers Satt162, Satt523 and Satt453 which are either linked with seed coat colour and seed permeability exhibited a specific size allelic fragments in soybean genotypes and crosses with better seed longevity. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
