#ITI#Crop production, nitrogen recovery and water use efficiency in rice-wheat rotation as affected by non-flooded mulching cultivation (NFMC)#FTI#
#IRE#Non-flooded mulching cultivation (NFMC) for lowland rice, as a novel water-saving technique, has been practiced in many areas of China since the 1990s. However, the information on NFMC effects on crop production, nitrogen and water use in rice-wheat rotations is still limited. A field experiment using 15N-labeled urea was conducted to evaluate the impacts of NFMC on crop yield, fertilizer N recovery and water use efficiency in rice-wheat rotations. Plastic film mulching (PM), and wheat straw and plastic film double mulching (SPM) resulted in the same rice grain yield (7.2 t ha-1) while wheat straw mulching (SM) and no mulching (NM) led to 5 and 10% yield reduction, compared with rice under traditional flooding (TF). In the rice-wheat rotation, crop productivity in PM, SM or SPM was comparable to that in TF but greater than in NM. Weed growth and its competition with rice for nitrogen were considered the main reason that led to yield decline in NM. Compared with TF, NFMC treatments did not obviously affect fertilizer N recoveries in plant and soil in both rice and wheat seasons. The total fertilizer N recoveries in crop, weed and soil in all treatments were only 39-44% in R-W rotations, suggesting that large N losses occurred following one basal N application for each growing season. Water use efficiency, however, was 56-75% greater in NFMC treatments than in TF treatment in the R-W rotation. The results revealed that NFMC (except NM) can produce comparable rice and wheat yields and obtain similar fertilizer N recovery as TF with much less water consumption. Â© Springer 2005.#FRE#
