#ITI#OsCOPT7 is a copper exporter at the tonoplast and endoplasmic reticulum and controls Cu translocation to the shoots and grain of rice#FTI#
#IRE#Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for all living organisms but is also highly toxic in excess. Cellular homoeostasis of Cu is maintained by various transporters and metallochaperones. Here, we investigated the biological function of OsCOPT7, a member of the copper transporters (COPT) family, in Cu homoeostasis in rice. OsCOPT7 was mainly expressed in the roots and the expression was upregulated by Cu deficiency. OsCOPT7 was localized at the tonoplast and the endoplasmic reticulum. Knockout of OsCOPT7 increased Cu accumulation in the roots but decreased Cu concentrations in the shoots and grain. The knockout mutants contained higher concentrations of Cu in the roots cell sap but markedly lower concentrations of Cu in the xylem sap than wild-type plants. Seed setting and grain yield were reduced significantly in the knockout mutants grown in a low Cu soil. Knockout mutants were more tolerant to Cu toxicity. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsCOPT7 interacts physically with the rice Cu chaperone antioxidant protein 1 (OsATX1). Taken together, our results indicate that OsCOPT7 is a specific Cu transporter functioning to export Cu from the vacuoles and the ER and plays an important role in controlling the root-to-shoot Cu translocation in rice. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
