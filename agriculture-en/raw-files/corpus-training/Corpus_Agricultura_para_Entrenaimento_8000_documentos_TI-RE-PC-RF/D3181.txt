#ITI#Inheritance Studies and Validation of Molecular Markers Associated with Botrytis Grey Mould in Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The Botrytis grey mould (BGM) is a devastating foliar disease of chickpea. In order to develop resistant high yielding varieties, the genetic mechanism governing the inheritance of resistance against BGM must be decoded. The molecular markers associated with BGM resistance are also need to be validated for marker assisted pyramiding of BGM resistance in chickpea. Methods: The present study was conducted during rabi seasons of 2014-18 at GBPUAT, Pantnagar. The experimental material consisted of six generations (P1, P2, F1, F2, BC1 and BC2 ) of a cross between a BGM resistant variety GL 10006 and susceptible variety H 208. The disease data was scored on nine-point (1-9) scale and were subjected to chi-square analysis. The inheritance was also studied by using 28 STMS markers at the Pulse Breeding Laboratory of GBPUAT, Pantnagar during 2017-18. The Single Marker Analysis was performed for validation of markers associated with BGM. Result: The results indicated that resistance for BGM in chickpea is dominant over susceptibility. A major QTL i.e. TA118 along with some minor QTLs are involved in governing resistance to BGM. The marker TA118, TS72 and TA144 can be used effectively in marker assisted selection for getting desirable recombinants in chickpea breeding. Â© 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
