#ITI#Calcium oxide nanoparticles mitigate lead stress in Abelmoschus esculentus though improving the key antioxidative enzymes, nutritional content and modulation of stress markers#FTI#
#IRE#Lead (Pb) is thought to be one of most injurious metals on the earth. Lead stress in plants enhances synthesis of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). During present research, impact of calcium-oxide nanoparticles (CaO-NPs) was observed on antioxidative defense mechanism in Abelmoschus esculentus plants prone to Pb stress. A CRD experiment was employed with 5 replicates having four treatments (T0 = Control, T1 = Pb stress (200 ppm), T2 = CaO-NPs and T3 = Pb + CaO-NPs). Pb-stressed seedlings exhibited decreased root growth, shoot growth, chlorophyll concentration and biomass accumulation. Moreover, higher synthesis of hydrogen-peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) and electrolyte leakage (EL) resulting in cellular injuries were noted in plants growing in Pb spiked conditions. Similarly, stressed plants showed higher accumulation of total soluble sugar and proline content besides elevated activity of antioxidative enzymes counting catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). On the contrary side, CaO-NPs alleviated the Pb induced phytotoxicity through improving activity of antioxidative enzymes. The elevated activity of antioxidant enzymes reduced biosynthesis of H2O2 and MDA which was revealed through the increased growth parameters. In addition, CaO-NPs persuaded enhancement in plant defence machinery by decreased chlorophyll deprivation and augmented the uptake of plant nutrients including K and Ca content. Hence, CaO-NPs can be potent regulators of the antioxidative enzymes and stress markers to ameliorate abiotic stresses. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
