#ITI#Graphical analysis of nitrogen and sulfur supply on yield and related traits of canola in eastern Canada#FTI#
#IRE#Profitable canola production depends upon an adequate supply of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) fertilizer. However, agricultural soils in eastern Canada seldom receive S fertilizer and rely on inherent S supply from biogeochemical and anthropogenic sources, which could be a yield-limiting factor for canola. The objective of this study was to document N × S fertilizer interactions to develop site-specific best management practices for canola production in eastern Canada. Factorial field experiments were conducted for four consecutive cropping seasons at five locations across eastern Canada. The N × S and N × S × environment interactions on seed yields and yield-related traits were visualized with the graphical analytical genotype and genotype-by-environment biplot tool. The highest seed yield was achieved with 150 kg N ha−1 together with 20–40 kg S ha−1 in 15 of the 19 test site-years. Seed yield was closely related to harvest index and number of seeds pod−1. Fertilizing canola with 20 kg S ha−1 enhanced the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of canola receiving 75 kg N ha−1, but the benefit of S fertilizer on NUE was negligible when N fertilizer rates increased to 150 kg N ha−1. Since canola yield response to fertilizer inputs varied from one site to another, due to the variation in environmental and soil conditions, we conclude that N × S fertilizer recommendations for canola production need to be developed on a site-specific basis in eastern Canada. © 2020, Crown.#FRE#
