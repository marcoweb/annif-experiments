#ITI#Effect of organic and inorganic phosphorus sources on quality of green gram (Vigna radiata L.) under temperate conditions of Jammu and Kashmir#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were conducted during two consecutive kharif seasons to assess the effect of organic and inorganic phosphorus sources on quality of green gram in temperate conditions of Jammu and Kashmir. The results revealed that application of organic manures significantly improved the total soluble sugars and protein content in grain of green gram. Among organic manures, application of FYM (10 t/ha) proved significantly superior over Dalweed (15 t/ha). Soil inoculation with P-solubilizers significantly increased the protein content in grain of green gram. Among Psolubilizers, inoculation with Pseudomonas proved significantly superior over Bacillus. Increasing levels of phosphorus up to 30 kg P 2O 5/ha significantly improved the total soluble sugars and protein content in grain of green gram. However, further increase in phosphorus level viz., 60 kg P 2O 5/ha had no beneficial influence on these quality parameters of green gram.#FRE#
