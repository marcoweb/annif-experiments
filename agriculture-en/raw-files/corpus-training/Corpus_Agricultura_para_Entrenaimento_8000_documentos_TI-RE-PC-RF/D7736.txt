#ITI#Water use, soil water balance and soil salinization risks of Mediterranean tree orchards in southern Portugal under current climate variability: Issues for salinity control and irrigation management#FTI#
#IRE#Secondary salinization has long been reported in the Roxo irrigation district (RID), southern Portugal, due to the use of saline-prone irrigation water and the existence of poorly structured soils. This study assessed the soil water and salt budgets in nine commercial orchards located in the RID using the multiple ion chemistry module available in the HYDRUS-1D model during the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons. The studied crops were almond, olive, citrus (orange, mandarin, and clementine), and pomegranate. The model successfully simulated soil water contents measured in the different fields but there was a clear underestimation of the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract (ECe) in some locations, while simulations of the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were generally acceptable. Modeling errors were mostly associated with missing information on fertigation events rather than related to the effects of irrigation water quality. The water and salt balances were also computed for the 1979–2020 period. Considering the probability of non-exceedance of salt accumulation during this period, the risk of salinity build-up was high to very high for the very dry years in most fields, except in the citrus sites. The factors influencing the salt accumulation were the irrigation strategy, the seasonal irrigation and rainfall depths, the duration of the crop growth period, the rainfall distribution in the late and non-growing stages, the soil drainage conditions, and the irrigation water quality. For the current climate conditions and irrigation water quality, the risk of soil salinity levels affecting crop development and yields was found to be minor. This means that, despite salts tended to accumulate in the rootzone over a season, under current conditions the salinity stress did not reach harmful levels for plants. Only in two of the study sites, there was a need to promote salt leaching. Hence, this study shows that soil salinization risks in the study area are low but, for given locations during drier seasons, there is a need for tailored irrigation solutions aimed at the conservation of soil and water resources. © 2023 The Authors#FRE#
