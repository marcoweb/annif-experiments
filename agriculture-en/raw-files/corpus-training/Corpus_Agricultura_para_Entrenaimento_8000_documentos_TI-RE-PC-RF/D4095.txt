#ITI#Characteristics of pigeon paramyxovirus serotype-1 isolates (PPMV-1) from the Russian Federation from 2001 to 2009#FTI#
#IRE#Monitoring programs for highly dangerous avian diseases in the Russian Federation from 2001 to 2009 detected 77 samples that were PCR positive for avian paramyxovirus serotype-1 (APMV-1) from sick or dead feral and domestic pigeons. Nucleotide sequences of the fusion (F) gene, including a nucleotide sequence encoding the F protein cleavage site, were determined for these isolates. All of the studied isolates possessed virulent F0 protein cleavage sites (112KRKKRF117, 112RRQKRF117, or 112KRQKRF117). Intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) values determined for seven of the isolates exceeded the value of 0.7 (the range from 0.8 to 1.41). Based on partial genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, the isolates were assigned to two individual sublineages within class II genotype VIb. It was determined that most of these Newcastle disease virus isolates (70/77) recovered from the pigeons belonged to a relatively poorly studied sublineage VIb/2. The complete nucleotide sequence of the genome for the Pigeon/Russia/Vladimir/687/05 isolate of sublineage VIb/2 was determined. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
