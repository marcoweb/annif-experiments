#ITI#A clinical case of chicken infectious anemia disease and virus DNA detection in naturally infected broilers in Greece#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, chicken infectious anemia virus (CIAV) DNA was detected from 12-day-old broilers. Clinical history showed that the clinical features were diarrhea, blue wing disease, depression, and death. Necropsy findings were pale liver, severe atrophy of bursa of Fabricius and thymus, and discoloration of the bone marrow as well as hemorrhages subcutaneously and a few in skeletal muscles. The majority of the necropsied broilers had developed gangrenous dermatitis. Histopathology showed hypoplasia of bone marrow and depletion of lymphocytes in spleen, bursa, and subcapsular thymic cortex. Karyorrhexis of lymphocytes was scattered in the thymic cortex and most pronounced in the bursal follicles. Eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were mainly located in lymphocytes of thymus, with a few in hemopoietic cells of bone marrow. CIAV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction from bursa, thymus, and bone marrow. A virus strain was detected and genetically characterized in 639 base pairs of VP1 gene. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Greek isolate was clustered together with isolates from Alabama, China, Slovenia, and Bangladesh.#FRE#
