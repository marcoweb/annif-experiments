#ITI#Effect of HHCB and Cd on phytotoxicity, accumulation, subcellular distribution and stereoselectivity of chiral HHCB in soil-plant systems#FTI#
#IRE#The toxicity of HHCB in the growth and development of plants is well known, but its uptake, subcellular distribution, and stereoselectivity, especially in a co-contamination environment, is not fully understood. Therefore, a pot experiment was performed to research the physiochemical response, and the fate of HHCB in pakchoi when the Cd co-existed in soil. The Chl contents were significantly lower, and the oxidative stress was aggravated under the co-exposure of HHCB and Cd. The accumulations of HHCB in roots were inhibited, and those in leaves were elevated. The transfer factors of HHCB in HHCB-Cd treatment increased. The subcellular distributions were analyzed in the cell walls, cell organelles, and cell soluble constituents of roots and leaves. In roots, the distribution proportion of HHCB followed cell organelle > cell wall > cell soluble constituent. In leaves, the distribution proportion of HHCB was different from that in roots. And the co-existing Cd made the distribution proportion of HHCB change. In the absence of Cd, the (4R,7S)-HHCB and (4R,7R)-HHCB were preferentially enriched in roots and leaves, and the stereoselectivity of chiral HHCB was more significant in roots than leaves. The co-existing Cd reduced the stereoselectivity of HHCB in plants. Our findings suggested that the fate of HHCB was affected by the co-existing Cd, so the risk of HHCB in the complicated environment should be paid more attention. © 2023#FRE#
