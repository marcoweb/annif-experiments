#ITI#Effect of herbicide stress on synchronization of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.)#FTI#
#IRE#Weed invasion causes significant yield losses in lentil. Imazethapyr (IM), a broad-spectrum herbicide inhibits the biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids necessary for plant growth. Plant growth depends upon translocation of photo-assimilates and their partitioning regulated by carbon and nitrogen metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the impact of imazethapyr spray on carbon and nitrogen metabolism in tolerant (LL1397 and LL1612) and susceptible (FLIP2004-7L and PL07) lentil genotypes during vegetative and reproductive development. Significantly higher activities of invertases and sucrose synthase (cleavage) in leaves and in podwall and seeds during early phase of development in tolerant genotypes were observed as compared to susceptible genotypes under herbicide stress that might be responsible for providing hexoses required for their growth. Activities of sucrose synthesizing enzymes, sucrose phosphate synthase and sucrose synthase (synthesis) increased significantly in podwalls and seeds of LL1397 and LL1612 genotypes during later phase of development towards maturity while the activities decreased in FLIP2004-7L and PL07 genotypes under herbicide stress. Activities of nitrate and nitrite reductase, glutamine 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase were increased in leaves, podwalls and seeds of LL1397 and LL1612 under herbicide stress. A proper synchronization of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in tolerant lentil genotypes during vegetative and reproductive phase might be one of the mechanisms for their recovery from herbicide stress. This first ever comprehensive information will provide a basis for future studies on the molecular mechanism of source sink relationship in lentil under herbicide stress and will be utilized in breeding programmes. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
