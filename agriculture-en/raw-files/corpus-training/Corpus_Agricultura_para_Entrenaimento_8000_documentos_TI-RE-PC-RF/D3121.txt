#ITI#Biology of pulse beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) and its response to botanicals in stored pigeonpea, Cajanus cajan (L.) grains#FTI#
#IRE#Biology of pulse beetle (Callosobruchus maculatus F.) was studied on pigeonpea grains during 2014-15 in laboratory conditions. The adult beetle was oval in shape and reddish-brown in colour, with dark stripes on each side of dorsal abdomen with average fecundity of 74.8±1.8 eggs per female. The average incubation period was 4.2±0.2 days with hatching 98.2±0.3 percent. Average larval-pupal period, oviposition, post-oviposition period, total life period and adult life span were 21.3±0.3, 8.2±0.5, 2.8±0.5, 33.3 ±2.4 and 12.0±2.1 days, respectively. The effect of nine botanicals viz., neem oil, mustard oil, groundnut oil, turmeric powder and their mixture and surface protectants viz., neem seed kernel powder, saw dust, sand, dung cake ash and wheat husk were used on pigeonpea seed against Callosobruchus maculatus. The highest mortality (84-100%) was observed by neem oil @ 10ml/kg and lowest (3.33%) by turmeric powder @ 3.5g/kg seeds, after 135 days of storage. Neem oil @ 10ml/kg was completely inhibited the oviposition, adult emergence and seed damage. All the oils and inert materials prevented egg laying, reduced population build up of beetles and minimized the seed damage as compare to control. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
