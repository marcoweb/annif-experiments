#ITI#Integrating transcriptome and phytohormones analysis provided insights into plant height development in sesame#FTI#
#IRE#Plant height is a key agronomic trait influencing crops yield. The height of sesame plants is important for yield performance, lodging resistance and plant architecture. Although plant height is significantly distinct among sesame varieties, the genetic basis of plant height remains largely unknown. In this study, in order to tackle genetic insights into the sesame plant height development, a comprehensive transcriptome analysis was conducted using the stem tips from two sesame varieties with distinct plant height, Zhongzhi13 and ZZM2748, at five time points by BGI MGIseq2000 sequencing platform. A total of 16,952 genes were differentially expressed between Zhongzhi13 and ZZM2748 at five time points. KEGG and MapMan enrichment analyses and quantitative analysis of phytohormones indicated that hormones biosynthesis and signaling pathways were associated with sesame plant height development. Plenty of candidate genes involved in biosynthesis and signaling of brassinosteroid (BR), cytokinin (CK) and gibberellin (GA) which were major differential hormones between two varieties were identified, suggesting their critical roles in plant height regulation. WGCNA revealed a module which was significantly positively associated with the plant height trait and founded SiSCL9 was the hub gene involved in plant height development in our network. Further overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis validated the function of SiSCL9 in the increase of plant height by 26.86%. Collectively, these results increase our understanding of the regulatory network controlling the development of plant height and provide a valuable genetic resource for improvement of plant architecture in sesame. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
