#ITI#Growth analysis in groundnut (Arachis hypogea L.) as influenced by foliar nutrition#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during kharif 2013 to Study “Foliar nutrition in groundnut (Arachis hypogea L.)“at Main Agricultural Research Station, Dharwad under rainfed situation. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block Design (RCBD) with three replications and ten foliar treatments of major nutrients. The growth attributes such as plant height (23.94 cm), number of branches (7.82 plant-1), chlorophyll content (43.58), leaf area (8.90 dm2 plant-1), leaf area index (2.97), leaf area duration (40.69 days), total dry matter production (40.22 g plant-1), net assimilation rate (0.136 g dm-2day-1) and crop growth rate (0.124g dm-2 day-1) were higher in foliar spray of 2.0% urea + DAP + MOP combination (T8). Similarly, pod yield (3746 kg ha-1), kernel yield (2905 kg ha-1), haulm yield (4253 kg ha-1) and harvest index (0.36) were higher in foliar spray of 2.0% urea + DAP + MOP combinationat 45 DAS followed by foliar spray of 19:19:19 N:P2O5:K2O compared to control (No spray). © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
