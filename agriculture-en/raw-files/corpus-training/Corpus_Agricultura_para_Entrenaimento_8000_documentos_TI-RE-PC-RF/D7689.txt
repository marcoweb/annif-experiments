#ITI#Mulching decreases nitrate leaching in bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) cultivation#FTI#
#IRE#A 2-year study was conducted in the Vrana Valley (Mediterranean region of Croatia) to evaluate the effects of application of different mulching materials and drip-fertigation on nitrate leaching in bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) cultivation. Nitrate-N leaching from the root zone of bell pepper was compared in three treatments: control without mulch, with black polyethylene (PE) mulch and with biodegradable cellulose mulch. In the first year, the highest quantities of nitrogen were leached in the treatment without mulch (26 kg ha-1) following by the treatment with cellulose mulch (18 kg ha-1) and the lowest nitrogen leaching (10 kg ha-1) was observed in the treatment with black PE mulch. At the end of the harvest, cellulose mulch, a microbiologically degradable material, started to decompose and disintegrate, which resulted in the cellulose mulch treatment behaving similarly than the control treatment without mulch. In the second year, significant leaching occurred after the last harvest in September. As the bell pepper yield was significantly lower than expected and calculated for fertilisation, the crop did not take up all nitrogen supplied by fertilisation, which resulted in higher concentrations of nitrate in the soil solution. These nitrate concentrations were subjected to leaching caused by precipitation, a regular occurrence in the autumn and winter in this region. However, mulched surfaces showed lower quantities of nitrate leached in comparison with the treatment without mulching. Mulching with black PE film, besides producing higher yields, reduces the leaching of nitrate fertilisers, and combined with fertigation can reduce a potential risk of surface and ground water pollution by nitrate.
