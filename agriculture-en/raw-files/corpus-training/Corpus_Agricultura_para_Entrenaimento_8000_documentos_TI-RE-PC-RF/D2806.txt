#ITI#Response of chickpea (Cicer kabulium) to different methods of P application, bio-inoculants and micronutrients#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were conducted during the rabi seasons of 2003-04 and 2004-05 at Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, to evaluate the effect of different methods of P application, bioinoculants and micronutrients (Mo+B) on growth and yield of kabuli chickpea (Cicer kabulium) var. Pragati.The experiments were laid out in split-split plot design with three replications. Main plot consisted of four different methods of P application, sub - plots consisted of bioinoculants and sub-sub-plots comprised of micronutrients. The experimental results revealed that Band placement (basal) recorded significantly higher dry weight (30.04g plant-1), pods plant-1(47.95), pod yield (12.01g plant-1), seed weight plant-1(13.09g) and seed yield (35.03qha-1). Among the bio-inoculants, the performance of dual inoculation of Trichoderma + PSB was the best having recorded significantly superior growth, yield attributes and yield. Increase in grain yield in Trichoderma + PSB was 10.75% and 12.79% over single inoculation of Trichoderma and PSB. Application of molybdenum + boron also significantly influenced nodulation (23.1 & 32.9 at 60 and 80 DAS), dry weight (32.0g plant-1), yield attributes and yield (32.72 q ha-1).#FRE#
