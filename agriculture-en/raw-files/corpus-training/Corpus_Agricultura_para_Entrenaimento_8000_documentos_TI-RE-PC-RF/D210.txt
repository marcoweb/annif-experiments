#ITI#Phytochemicals and anti-tyrosinase activities of Paeonia ostii leaves and roots#FTI#
#IRE#Tree peony (sect. Moutan) is a kind of Traditional Chinese Medicine and ornamental plant, which has been widely cultivated and utilized for thousands of years. To further study the active components of Paeonia ostii (Moutan, Fengdan), six fractions (soluble free (F), soluble esterification, soluble glycosylation, insoluble bound, insoluble esterification and insoluble glycosylation) were extracted from the leaves and roots by alkaline and acid treatment for the first time. Twenty-one typical compounds were identified and quantified by HPLC-MS. The results showed that total phenolic content (TPC) in peony roots (PR) and peony leaves (PL) were as high as 125.48 and 280.38 mg GAE·g−1 dw, which maximizes the extraction efficiency of phenolic compounds, especially leaves, compared with the conventional method. PR-F and PL-F had the highest TPC, antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase activities. Paeoniflorin was the main compounds in PL and PR. It and pentagalloylglucose (PGG) almost reached the anti-tyrosinase level of kojic acid, but they showed different inhibitory mechanisms by molecular docking. On the whole, PR-F, PL-F, PGG and paeoniflorin might be potential for skin whitening products. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
