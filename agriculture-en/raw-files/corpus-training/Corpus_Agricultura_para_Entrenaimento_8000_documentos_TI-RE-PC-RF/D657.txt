#ITI#Thaumatin-like protein family genes VfTLP4-3 and VfTLP5 are critical for faba bean's response to drought stress at the seedling stage#FTI#
#IRE#Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) are a diverse family of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-5) found in various plant species. Faba bean is an economically important crop known for its nutritional value and resilience to harsh environmental conditions, including drought. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the gene structure, phylogenetics, and expression patterns of TLP genes in faba bean, with a specific focus on their response to drought stress. A total of 10 TLP genes were identified and characterized from the faba bean transcriptome, which could be classified into four distinct groups based on their evolutionary relationships. Conserved cysteine residues and REDDD motifs, which are characteristic features of TLPs, were found in most of the identified VfTLP members, and these proteins were likely to reside in the cytoplasm. Two genes, VfTLP4-3 and VfTLP5, exhibited significant upregulation under drought conditions. Additionally, ectopically expressing VfTLP4-3 and VfTLP5 in tobacco leaves resulted in enhanced drought tolerance and increased peroxidase (POD) activity. Moreover, the protein VfTLP4-3 was hypothesized to interact with glycoside hydrolase family 18 (GH18), endochitinase, dehydrin, Barwin, and aldolase, all of which are implicated in chitin metabolism. Conversely, VfTLP5 was anticipated to associate with peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase-like 3, a molecule linked to the synthesis of proline. These findings suggest that these genes may play crucial roles in mediating the drought response in faba bean through the regulation of these metabolic pathways, and serve as a foundation for future genetic improvement strategies targeting enhanced drought resilience in this economically important crop.
