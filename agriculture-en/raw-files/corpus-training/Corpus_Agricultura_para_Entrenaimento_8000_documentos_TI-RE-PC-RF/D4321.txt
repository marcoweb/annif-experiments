#ITI#An rRT-PCR assay to detect the matrix gene of a broad range of avian paramyxovirus serotype-1 strains#FTI#
#IRE#The current U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)validated real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay designed to detect the matrix gene of avian paramyxovirus serotype-1 (APMV-1) is the primary screening assay used in the United States. It has previously been shown to be unable to consistently detect all members of class I APMV-1. Diagnostic testing relies on rRT-PCR to quickly detect APMV-1 in wild birds, backyard flocks, live bird markets, commercial poultry, and for export testing. Limitations of the current USDA assay have raised concerns about the potential for some strains of APMV-1 to remain undetected by the primary screening assay. Mismatches in the probe were shown to cause a loss in template binding efficiency, resulting in lack of detection by the assay. Here, we describe the development and analytical validation of a new rRT-PCR assay designed to target a highly conserved region of the matrix gene across a wide range of APMV-1 strains. Limit of detection testing revealed a 3log10 decrease in sensitivity for one low-virulence strain when compared to the USDA validated assay. Conversely, the assay showed increased sensitivity for a class I isolate and two virulent strains of APMV-1 that were not detected by the USDA-validated assay. The new assay also demonstrated a high degree of specificity by the lack of detection of 43 nonAPMV-1 viruses. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
