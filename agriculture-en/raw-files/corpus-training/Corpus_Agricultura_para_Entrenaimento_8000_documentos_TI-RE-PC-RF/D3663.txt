#IRE#Spray droplet size has long been recognized as an important variable that applicators of vector control sprays must be aware of to make the most effective spray applications. Researchers and applicators have several different techniques available to assess spray droplet size from spray nozzles. The objective of this study was to compare the droplet size spectrum produced by three nozzles commonly used in vector control in a high-speed wind tunnel, when characterized using three different laser-based droplet size measurement systems. Three droplet sizing systems: Malvern Spraytec laser diffraction, Sympatec HELOS laser diffraction, and TSI Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA), were simultaneously operated, but under different operating conditions, to measure the spray droplet size-spectra for three spray nozzles. The three atomizers: a TeeJet® 8001E even flat fan nozzle, a BETE® PJ high pressure fog nozzles, and a Micronair ® AU5000 rotary atomizer were evaluated in a high speed wind tunnel at airspeeds of 53 and 62 m/s (120 and 140 mph). Based on the results of this work, only the BETE® PJ high pressure fog nozzles met the label requirements for both Fyfanon® and Anvil®. While the other nozzle might met the Dv0.5(VMD - volume median diameter) requirement for Fyfanon®, the resulting Dv0.9values exceeded labeled size restrictions. When applying Anvil with the BETE PJ high pressure fog nozzles, it is important to use the smaller two orifice sizes. The larger sizes tended to result in Dv0.9values that exceeded label recommendations.#FRE#
