#ITI#Rapid detection of Mycoplasma synoviae and avian reovirus in clinical samples of poultry using multiplex PCR#FTI#
#IRE#Mycoplasma synoviae and avian reovirus (ARV) are associated with several disease syndromes in poultry and cause notable global economic losses in the poultry industry. Rapid and efficient diagnostics for these avian pathogens are important not only for disease control but also for prevention of clinical disease progression. However, current diagnostic methods used for surveillance of these diseases in poultry flocks are laborious and time-consuming, and they have low sensitivity. The multiplex PCR (mPCR) developed in this study has been proven to be both sensitive and specific for simultaneous M. synoviae and ARV detection and identification in clinical samples. To evaluate the mPCR assay, the diagnostic test was applied to different clinical samples from natural and experimental M. synoviae and ARV-infected poultry. Results were compared with serologic, single PCR, and immunofluorescence analyses. Tibiotarsal articulation could be the best target for simultaneous detection of M. synoviae and ARV infection. The detection limit by visualization of mPCR-amplified products was 100 pg for both pathogens. Overall, the mPCR developed and standardized in this research is a useful tool for diagnosis and screening and for surveillance and control of M. synoviae and ARV infection in poultry flocks. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
