#ITI#Functional traits of leaves and photosynthetic stems of species from a sarcocaulescent scrub in the southern Baja California Peninsula#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Photosynthetic stems represent a source of extra carbon in plants from hot and dry environments, but little is known about how leaves and photosynthetic stems differ in terms of photosynthetic capacity, trait coordination, and responses to seasonal drought in subtropical systems. Methods: We studied photosynthetic, hydraulic, morphometric (specific leaf area [SLA], wood density [WD]), and biochemical (C and N isotopes) traits in leaves and photosynthetic stems of 12 plant species from a sarcocaulescent scrub in the southern Baja California Peninsula, Mexico, in wet and dry seasons. Results: Leaves and stems had similar mean photosynthetic capacity, as evaluated by chlorophyll fluorescence traits, indicating similar investment in leaf and stem photosynthesis. We did not find a relationship between stem hydraulic conductivity and leaf or stem photosynthetic traits. However, we found resource allocation trade-offs, between WD and both stem hydraulic conductivity and SLA. Leaf and stem photosynthetic traits did not change with season, but specific stem area was one of the few traits that changed the most between seasons—it increased during the dry season by as much as 154% indicating substantial water storage. Conclusions: Our results indicate the same proportional investment in photosynthetic capacity and dry matter in both leaves and photosynthetic stems across all 12 species. We identified multiple strategies at this seasonal site, with species ranging from high WD, low SLA, low hydraulic conductivity, and high specific bark area on one end of the spectrum and opposite traits on the other end. © 2020 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
