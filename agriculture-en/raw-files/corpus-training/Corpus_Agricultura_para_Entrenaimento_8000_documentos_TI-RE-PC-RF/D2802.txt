#ITI#Effect of growth regulators on yield of summer greengram#FTI#
#IRE#The results of the experiment on effect of various plant growth regulators on yield of summer greengram revealed that the spray of significantly highest number of pods per plant and number of grains per pod of 22.15 and 7.45 respectively, were recorded under NAA 40 ppm at 20 and 40 DAS application. This treatment also recorded significantly the highest grain weight per plant (6.02 g). Spray of NAA 40 ppm at 20 and 40 DAS recorded maximum grain yield of 1228 kg/ha and stover yield (1890 kg/ha).#FRE#
