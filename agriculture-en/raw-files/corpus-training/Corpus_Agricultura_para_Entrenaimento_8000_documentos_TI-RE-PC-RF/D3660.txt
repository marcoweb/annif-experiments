#ITI#Reduced herbicide doses used together with allelopathic sorghum and sunflower water extracts for weed control in wheat#FTI#
#IRE#Water extracts from allelopathic crops possess the potential to control weeds effectively, especially when used in combination with reduced rates of herbicides. Label doses of different herbicides and their seventy percent reduced doses, were combined with 18 l/ha each of allelopathic sorghum and sunflower water extracts (WE). This combination was sprayed 30 days after sowing (DAS) for weed control in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Maximum reduction in total weed density and dry weight over the control, was recorded in a field sprayed with mesosulfuron + idosulfuron (Atlantis 3.6 WG) at 14.4 g active substance (a.s.)/ha. However, sorghum + sunflower WE each at 18 l/ha combined with doses which had been reduced by 70% of mesosulfuron + idosulfuron (Atlantis 12 EC at 36 g a.s./ha), or metribuzin + phenoxaprop (Bullet 38 SC at 57 g a.s./ha) or mesosulfuron + idosulfuron (Atlantis 3.6 WG at 4.32 g a.s./ha), reduced total weed dry weight by more than 90%, over the control. Sorghum and sunflower water extracts each at 18 l/ha combined with metribuzin + phenoxaprop (Bullet 38 SC at 57 g a.s./ha) produced a maximum number of productive tillers, spikelets per spike, number of grains per spike, biological yield and grain yield. Moreover, this treatment was the most economical along with having the maximum net benefits. The results suggested that weeds can be controlled in wheat, for a higher yield, when a 70% reduced herbicide dose is used in combination with allelopathic sorghum and sunflower water extracts.#FRE#
