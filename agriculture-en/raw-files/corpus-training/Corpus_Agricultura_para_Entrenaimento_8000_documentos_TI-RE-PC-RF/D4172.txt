#ITI#Efficacy and safety of cell-associated vaccines against Marek's disease virus grown in QT35 cells or JBJ-1 cells#FTI#
#IRE#The Marek's disease virus (MDV) vaccine strain CVI 988 usually is grown in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs). We found that the strains could be grown also in the QT35 and JBJ-1 cell lines to titers in the same range as in the CEFs. Both cell lines are fibroblast-like cell lines, which can be grown in flat-bottomed tissue-culture flasks, roller bottles, and on microcarriers. For growth in QT35 cells it was necessary to adapt the virus to the cell line; for growth in JBJ-1 cells this was not necessary. We investigated the efficacy of experimental CVI 988 vaccines grown in QT35 cells and JBJ-1 cells. The efficacy studies were performed in accordance with European Pharmacopoeia (EP) monograph for live MDV disease vaccines. Groups of 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks were vaccinated. Nonvaccinated control groups were included in the studies. Five to 7 days after vaccination all chickens were challenged with the very virulent MDV strain RB1B. After challenge the chickens were observed for a period of 70 days for signs of MD. The protection induced by CVI 988 grown in QT35 cells as well as JBJ-1 cells complied with the requirements of the EP that prescribe that the protection index should be at least 80%. The safety of the vaccines grown in QT35 cells and JBJ-1 cells was tested in a field study in commercial layer chickens. The vaccine virus was not safe after passaging in QT35 cells. This can be explained by the presence of fragments of the genome of MDV strains in the QT35 cell line. No signs of MD were noticed in the study in which CVI988 grown in JBJ-1 cells was tested. It is concluded that the JBJ-1 cell line is a suitable substrate for the current vaccines against MD. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
