#ITI#Comparative biological sensitivity and mutability of chemo-mutagens in lentil (Lens culinaris medik)#FTI#
#IRE#Present investigation was carried out using three different categories of chemical mutagens viz., ethylmethane sulphonate (EMS)-an alkylating agent, hydrazine hydrate (HZ)-a base analogue and sodium azide (SA)-a respiratory inhibitor on two varieties viz., Pant L-406 and Type-8 of lentil to study the immediate biological damage induced by the mutagens and to determine the sensitivity of biological material in question. Biological damage induced in M1 generation was estimated in terms of seed germination, seedling height and pollen fertility. A dose dependent reduction with increasing concentrations of the mutagens for all these parameters was observed in both the varieties. The inhibition was more severe at the highest concentration of all the three mutagens under study. Variety Type-8 was found to be more sensitive than the var. Pant L-406 with respect to the mutagens utilized. Reduction in seed germination, seedling growth and pollen fertility in M2 generation was reasonably less as compared to M1 generation.
