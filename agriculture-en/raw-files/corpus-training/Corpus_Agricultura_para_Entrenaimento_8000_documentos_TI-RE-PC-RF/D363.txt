#ITI#Role of biostimulants (ascorbic acid and fulvic acid) to synergize Rhizobium activity in pea (Pisum sativum L. var. Meteor)#FTI#
#IRE#Biostimulants such as ascorbic acid (AA) and fulvic acid (FA)can enhance the efficiency of root-nodulating bacteria. This study investigates optimum concentration of these two biostimulants to maximize the Rhizobium activity and increase root size, nodulation capability, NPK uptake, yield and quality. Interaction with nitrogenase enzyme through molecular docking was also studied by using both AA and FA as ligands to better understand their inhibitory role in excess amounts. The findings of the study suggest: the combined application of both FA and AA at 200 ppm concentrations proved to be more effective than the individual application. Excellent vegetative growth was noticed which translated into an increased reproductive growth i.e statistically significant increase in number of pods per plant, fresh and dry weight of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, total chlorophyll, carotenoids and chemical constituents of pea seeds i.e. N (16.17%), P (40.47%), K (39.96%) and protein (16.25%). These findings were substantiated by molecular docking of nitrogenase enzyme with ascorbic acid and fulvic acid. The XP docking score of ascorbic acid (−7.07 kcal mol-1) and fulvic acid (−6.908 kcal mol-1) exhibited that the optimum doses (200 ppm) should be used as higher dose or their excess amount can hinder the Rhizobium activity of nitrogen fixation by interacting with the nitrogenase enzyme. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
