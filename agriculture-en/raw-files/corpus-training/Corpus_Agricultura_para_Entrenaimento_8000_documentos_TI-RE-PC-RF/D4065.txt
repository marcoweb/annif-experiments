#ITI#Occurrence of avian botulism in Korea during the period from June to September 2012#FTI#
#IRE#Botulism is a paralytic disease caused by the botulinum neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. In the summer season in Korea, intensive outbreaks of avian botulism were reported in both poultry and wild birds, including five Korean native chicken farms (HanHyup NO.3), one pheasant (Phasianus colchicus karpowi) farm, and one community of spot-billed ducks (Anas poecilorhyncha). The affected domestic birds showed 24.5% to 58.3% mortality, with specific clinical signs including ataxia, limber neck, and diarrhea. To confirm the botulinum toxin, neutralization tests were performed on sera (four Korean native chicken farms and one pheasant farm) or culture supernatant (spot-billed ducks). Additionally, the contents of the cecum and liver from poultry presenting signs suggestive of botulism were inoculated to isolate the pathogen. The toxin genes were then detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Through the neutralization tests, it was possible to diagnose the botulism and, except in the case of one Korean native chicken farm, to identify the type of pathogen. Using detection by PCR, except in two cases of the Korean native chicken farms, the botulinum toxin gene was found. Additionally, in four cases, it was possible to identify the C/D mosaic type using PCR. This paper reports the first occurrence of avian botulism in domestic birds and the first detection of botulism caused by this mosaic type in Korea.
