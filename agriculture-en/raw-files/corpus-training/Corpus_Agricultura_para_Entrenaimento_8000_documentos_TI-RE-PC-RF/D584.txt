#ITI#Methyl jasmonate redirects the dynamics of carbohydrates and amino acids toward the lignans accumulation in Linum album cells#FTI#
#IRE#Linum album accumulates lignans e.g., podophyllotoxin (PTOX) and 6-methoxy podophyllotoxin (6MPTOX). This study was aimed to figure out how different concentrations of MeJA (0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 μM) by affecting on free sugars and amino acids contents induce lignans accumulation in L. album cells. Results revealed that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content increased at 50μM, while it decreased at the high levels of MeJA (150 and 200 μM). Also, increasing trend of nitric oxide (NO) and lipid peroxidation levels peaked at 200 μM MeJA. An increased antioxidant enzymes activity was also observed in the treated cells. Moreover, an increase in rhamnose/xylose, glucose, and mannose was detected at 150 and 200 μM MeJA compared to the control. These compounds provide energy source and carbon skeleton for amino acids biosynthesis. Our results emphasized variations in amino acids levels in the presence of MeJA, where Phe level shifts along with synthesizing phenolics. Likewise, MeJA treatment switch on phenyl-ammonia lyase (PAL) and tyrosine-ammonia lyase (TAL) activities that regenerate phenolic compounds. Changes in phenolic acids (cinnamic, coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, and salicylic acid) and flavonoids (catechin, vitexin, myricetin, and kaempferol) were observed under MeJA treatment. Eventually, MeJA induced lignans production except for lariciresinol (LARI), so that the highest amounts of PTOX and 6MPTOX were analyzed at 50 μM, which were 4 and 5 time of control, respectively. Conclusively, it can be suggested that MeJA-induced oxidative status change redirects free sugars and amino acids toward the production of phenolic compounds especially lignans in L. album cells. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
