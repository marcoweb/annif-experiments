#ITI#Evaluation of Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) Cultivars for Destabilized Ecosystem of North Eastern Hill Region#FTI#
#IRE#Performance of 27 improved groundnut cultivars were assessed for agronomic and physiological traits associated to improve the productivity in degraded acid soils under rainfed hilly ecosystem. The cultivars ICGS-76 and ICGV-86590 produced significantly (p<0.05) higher pod yield with more than 39% improvement over JL-24. The study also identified five more promising cultivars viz. ICGS-5, TKG-19 A, TG-37-A, GG-11 and GG-21 with 19-38% higher yield over the check. The low productivity of cereals in the acidic and moisture stressed Jhum degraded upland soils of rainfed hilly ecosystem of Eastern Himalayan Region is a major concern for socio-economic improvement of resource poor farmers. Adoption of these cultivars is expected to increase the productivity and net income to a tune of 93.2% without incurring any additional costs to the prevailing production system.
