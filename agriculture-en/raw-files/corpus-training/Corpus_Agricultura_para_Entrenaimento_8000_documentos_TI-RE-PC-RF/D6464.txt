#ITI#Variation in fruit and seed dimensions is better explained by dispersal system than by leaf size in a tropical rainforest#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Variation in fruit and seed traits could originate from selection pressures exerted by frugivores or other ecological factors (adaptive hypotheses) and developmental constraints (by-product hypotheses) or chance. Methods: We evaluated fruit and leaf traits for nearly 850 plant species from a rainforest in Tinigua Park, Colombia. Through a series of linear regressions controlling for the phylogenetic signal of the traits (minimum N = 542), we tested (1) whether the allometry between seed width and length depends on seed dispersal system (Mazer and Wheelwright's adaptive hypothesis of allometry for species dispersed in the guts of animals = endozoochory) and (2) whether fruit length is associated with leaf length (i.e., Herrera's by-product hypothesis derived from the assumption that both organs develop from homologous structures). Results: We found a strong negative allometric association between seed width and length for seeds of endozoochorous species, as expected; but also, for anemochorous species. We found a positive relationship between fruit and leaf length, but this relationship was not evident for zoochorous species. Fruit size was highly correlated with seed size. Conclusions: The allometry between seed length and width varied among dispersal systems, supporting that fruit and seed morphology has been modified by interactions with frugivores and by the possibility to rotate for some wind dispersed species. We found some support for the hypothesis on developmental constraints because fruit and leaf size were positively correlated, but the predictive power of the relationship was low (10–15%). © 2023 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
