#ITI#Metabolome profiling of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus treated Ocimum tenuiflorum L. provides insights into deviation in allocation of carbon compounds to secondary metabolism#FTI#
#IRE#Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) has been reported to influence secondary metabolism of Ocimum tenuiflorum L., thereby improving its therapeutic and commercial importance. To explain changes in the secondary metabolite profile, the study reports effects of AM on leaf metabolome of two high yielding genotypes of O. tenuiflorum inoculated with Rhizophagus intraradices. NMR-based non-targeted metabolic fingerprinting was related to changes at physiological, biochemical, and molecular levels in mycorrhizal (M) plants. AM resulted in higher accumulation of sucrose, which could be related with enhanced photosynthesis by virtue of increased uptake of mineral nutrients. A strong positive correlation between sucrose and net photosynthetic rate and sucrose and mineral nutrients supported that AM-mediated increase in uptake of mineral nutrients is associated with enhanced photosynthetic rate and accumulation of sucrose. Further, higher sucrose synthase activity resulted in increased glucose. Hexokinase activity was also higher in M plants resulting in higher pyruvate accumulation. On the contrary, Krebs cycle was compromised in M plants as evident by lower activities of its enzymes and concentrations of organic and amino acids. Nevertheless, AM increased activities and expressions of enzymes of terpenoid biosynthesis, shikimate, and phenylpropanoid pathways, thereby resulting in augmented production of terpenoids, phenylalanine, and phenols, respectively. Thus, metabolic reprogramming downstream of glycolysis was apparent wherein AMF resulted in more allocation of carbon resources to secondary metabolism as opposed to primary metabolism, which was supported by Pearson's correlation analysis. Higher C:N ratio in M plants explains the provision of more carbon resources to secondary metabolism as against primary metabolism. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
