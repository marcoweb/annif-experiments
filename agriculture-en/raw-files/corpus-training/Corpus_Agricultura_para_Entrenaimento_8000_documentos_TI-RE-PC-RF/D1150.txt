#ITI#Changes in root hydraulic conductivity in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in response to salt stress and day/night can best be explained through altered activity of aquaporins#FTI#
#IRE#Salt stress reduces plant water flow during day and night. It is not known to which extent root hydraulic properties change in parallel. To test this idea, hydroponically grown wheat plants were grown at four levels of salt stress (50, 100, 150 and 200 mM NaCl) for 5–8d before harvest (d14–18) and subjected to a range of analyses to determine diurnal changes in hydraulic conductivity (Lp) at cell, root and plant level. Cell pressure probe analyses showed that the Lp of cortex cells was differentially affected by salt stress during day and night, and that the response to salt stress differed between the main axis of roots and lateral roots. The Aquaporin (AQP) inhibitor H2O2 reduced Lp to a common, across treatments, level as observed in salt-stressed plants during the night. Analyses of transpiring plants and exuding root systems provided values of root Lp which were in the same range as values modeled based on cell-Lp. The results can best be explained through a change in root Lp in response to salt stress and day/night, which results from an altered activity of AQPs. qPCR gene expression analyses point to possible candidate AQP isoforms. © 2023 The Authors.
