#ITI#Production Potential of Pigeon Pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] as Influenced by Crop Geometry and Plant Growth Regulators#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Pigeonpea being highly branching and indeterminate growth habit responds very well to crop geometry. Hence to achieve potential yields, it is important to maintain optimum plant population which can effectively utilize available moisture, nutrients and solar radiation. The plant growth regulators are also known to enhance the source sink relationship and stimulate the translocation of photo assimilates, thereby increase the productivity. Methods: A field experiment was conducted at experimental farm of Agronomy Department, V.N.M.K.V., Parbhani during kharif season of 2018 and 2019. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with four main plot treatments comprised of four crop geometries as 90 cm x 20 cm, 120 cm x 20 cm 60-120 cm x 20 cm and 75-150 cm x 20+++ cm and sub plot treatments were five treatments on foliar application of plant growth regulators i.e. NAA @ 40 ppm, Mepiquat chloride @ 50 g a.i. ha-1, Brassinosteroids @ 0.1 ppm, Chlormequat Chloride @ 75 g a.i ha-1 and control. Result: The crop geometry of 120 cm x 20 cm and 75-150 cm x 20 cm recorded higher values of all yield parameters followed by crop geometry of 60-120 cm x 20 cm.While the seed, straw and biological yield of pigeonpea as well as highest net realization of Rs. 72072 ha-1 was obtained with crop geometry of 60-120 cm x 20 cm followed by 90 cm x 20 cm. Among the plant growth regulators foliar application of Brassinosteroids @ 0.1 ppm (G3) tended to recorded higher yield parameters, seed yield and fertility coefficient of pigeonpea as well as highest net realization followed by foliar application of NAA @ 40 ppm.
