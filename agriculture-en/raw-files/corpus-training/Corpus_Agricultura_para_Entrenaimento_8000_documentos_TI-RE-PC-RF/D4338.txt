#ITI#Development of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect chicken serum antibody to glycoprotein g of infectious laryngotracheitis virus#FTI#
#IRE#Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a significant upper respiratory tract disease of chickens and has a worldwide distribution. Diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are commonly used in ILT disease control programs. These ELISAs generally detect serum antibody to infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) and frequently utilize whole virus as the ELISA antigen. This study investigated the use of recombinant glycoprotein G (gG) of ILTV as an alterative to the use of whole virus antigen. Codon-optimized ILTV gG was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with a maltose binding protein tag (gG-MBP). Another gG fusion protein with a 6-histidine tag (gG-His) was expressed in a baculovirus expression system. Following purification, the proteins were assessed for their suitability to be used as an antigen in an ELISA to detect ILTV-specific antibodies in sera from commercial and specific-pathogen-free (SPF) birds. The gG-MBP antigen showed some nonspecific reactions with chicken sera, but the gG-HIS antigen was found to be suitable for differentiating between sera collected from ILTV-vaccinated and unvaccinated chickens. The highest levels of agreement between the results from the gG-HIS ELISA and the commercial Trop-ILT ELISA were achieved using a cut-off value for positivity equal to the geometric mean antibody concentration of the sera from the unvaccinated birds plus 1 SD. This produced a very good level of agreement (kappa value of 0.821) using sera from commercial birds and a moderate level of agreement ( value of 0.506) using sera from SPF birds. Importantly, this ELISA was also tested for its ability to discriminate between sera collected from SPF chickens vaccinated with a gG deletion mutant candidate vaccine strain of ILTV (gG-ve ILTV) and sera collected from SPF chickens vaccinated with other ILTV strains. The results showed that the gG-His ELISA has the potential to serve as a companion diagnostic tool in conjunction with the gG-ve ILTV vaccine in a 'differentiating infected from vaccinated animals' approach to the control of ILT.
