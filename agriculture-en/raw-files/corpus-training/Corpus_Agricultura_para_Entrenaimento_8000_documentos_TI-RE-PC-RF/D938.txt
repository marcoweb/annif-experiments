#ITI#Enhancing biomass production and biochemical compositions of Spirodela polyrhiza through superhydrophobic cultivation platforms at low light intensity#FTI#
#IRE#Duckweed, a floating macrophyte, has attracted interest in various fields such as animal feedstocks and bioenergy productions. Its enriched nutritional content and rapid growth rate make it particularly promising. However, common laboratory cultures of duckweed often experience fronds layering, diminishing the efficiency of sunlight capturing due to limited surface area on conventional cultivation platforms. In this work, we aimed to address the issue of fronds layering by introducing a novel cultivation platform - a superhydrophobic coated acrylic sheet. The sheet was prepared by spray-coating a suspension of beeswax and ethanol, and its effectiveness was evaluated by comparing the growth performance of giant duckweed, Spirodela polyrhiza, on this platform with that on a modified version. The superhydrophobic coated acrylic sheet (SHPA) and its variant with a metal mesh added (SHPAM) were employed as growing platforms, with a glass jar serving as the control. The plantlets were grown for 7 days with similar growth conditions under low light stress (25 μmol/m2/s). SHPAM demonstrated superior growth performance, achieving a mass gain of 102.12 ± 17.18 %, surpassing both SHPA (89.67 ± 14.97 %) and the control (39.26 ± 8.94 %). For biochemical compositions, SHPAM outperformed in chlorophyll content, protein content and lipid content. The values obtained were 1.021 ± 0.076 mg/g FW, 14.59 ± 0.58 % DW and 6.21 ± 0.75 % DW respectively. Therefore, this work proved that incorporation of superhydrophobic coatings on a novel cultivation platform significantly enhanced the biomass production of S. polyrhiza. Simultaneously, the biochemical compositions of the duckweeds were well-maintained, showcasing the potential of this approach for optimized duckweed cultivation. © 2024#FRE#
