#ITI#Productivity and profitability of legume-cereal forages under different planting ratio and nitrogen fertilization#FTI#
#IRE#To study the effect of different planting ratios and nitrogen levels on yields and economics of fodder maize and cowpea, an experiment was laid out in split plot arrangement with three intercropping row ratios of maize:cowpea (1:1, 2:1 and 1:2) in main plot and five nitrogen levels (0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg N/ha) in sub plot with three replication. The maize and cowpea planted under 1:2 ratio showed maximum values of growth parameters (i.e. plant height, number of leaves, leaf length, leaf width, stem girth, number of branches and leaf to stem ratio), nutrient content and their uptake (N and P) over 1:1 and 2:1 ratio. The significantly higher value aforesaid growth parameters of maize were recorded with applications of 90 kg N/ha. However, cowpea showed significantly higher value of growth parameters upto 60 kg N/ha. The highest total DMY (141.22 q/ha) and maize DMY (122.92 q/ha), net return (57089.42) and B:C ratio (1.72) were observed under 2:1 intercropping ratio. However, in case of cowpea, 1:2 intercropping ratio resulted in highest DMY (33.25 q/ha). Among fertility levels the significantly maximum total DMY, maize DMY and farm profitability, nutrient content and uptake by maize were observed with 120 kg N/ha. However, cowpea showed significantly increase in DMY up to 30 kg N/ha only. The 1:2 intercropping ratio resulted in 5.60 and 6.70% higher soil N and 4.00 and 2.57% higher soil P over 1:1 and 2:1 intercropping ratios. The use of 120 kg N/ha resulted 2.0, 6.6, 9.3 and 20.2% improvement in soil N over 0, 30, 60 and 90 kg N/ha, respectively. Thus it can be concluded that to realize higher productivity and farm profitability their planting 2:1 ratios with use of 120 and 60 kg N/ha, respectively is a viable option and may quite helpful in sustain the performance of livestock in terms of health and milk production. © 2019; Agricultural Research Communication Centre, All rights reserved.#FRE#
