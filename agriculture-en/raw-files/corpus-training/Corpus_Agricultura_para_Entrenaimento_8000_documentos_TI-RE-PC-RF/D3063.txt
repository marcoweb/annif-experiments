#ITI#Influence of system of cultivation and genotypes of preceding rice-ratoon on growth and yield of green gram (Vigna radiata L.) sown at varying dates in coastal alluvium soil of Eastern India#FTI#
#IRE#                             Field experiment was conducted in coastal alluvium soil of eastern India during late rabi of 2009-10 and 2010-11 in split split-plot design with three dates of sowing for rice-ratoon i.e. 20 June, 5 and 20 July followed by green gram cv. PDM-139 (Samrat) i.e. 2 January, 17 January and 1 February in main plots, three systems of cultivation of the preceding rice-ratoon i.e. ratoons of rice under best management practices (BMP), system of rice intensification (SRI) and modified SRI (MSRI) in sub plots and two genotypes of rice-ratoon i.e. HR Ajay and HYV Tapaswini in sub sub-plots. Green gram was grown under residual soil nutrient and the crop sown on 2 January recorded the highest seed yield of 0.703 t ha                             -1                              (REY of 2.933 t ha                             -1                             ) and this was followed by sowing on 17 January and 1 February. The seed yield of green gram followed diminishing trend under SRI-ratoon, MSRI-ratoon and BMP-ratoon, respectively.                          Â© 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
