#ITI#Response of white leghorn chickens of various genetic lines to infection with avian leukosis virus subgroup J#FTI#
#IRE#In Experiment 1, chickens from various white leghorn experimental lines were inoculated with strain ADOL-Hcl of subgroup J avian leukosis virus (ALV-J) either as embryos or at 1 day of age. At various ages, chickens were tested for ALV-J induced viremia, antibody, and packed cell volume (PCV). Also, at 4 and 10 wk of age, bursal tissues were examined for avian leukosis virus (ALV)-induced preneoplastic lesions with the methyl green-pyronine (MGP) stain. In Experiment 2, chickens harboring or lacking endogenous virus 21 (EV21) were inoculated with strain ADOL-Hcl of ALV-J at hatch. All embryo-inoculated chickens in Experiment 1 tested positive for ALV-J and lacked antibody throughout the experimental period of 30 wk and were considered viremic tolerant, regardless of line of chickens. By 10 wk of age, the incidence of ALV-J viremia in chickens inoculated with virus at hatch varied from 0 (line 0 chickens) to 97% (line 15I5); no influence of ALV-J infection was noted on PCV. Results from microscopic examination of MGP-stained bursal tissues indicate that ALV-J can induce typical ALV-induced transformation in bursal follicles of white leghorn chickens. Lymphoid leukosis and hemangiomas were the most common ALV-J-induced tumors noted in chickens in Experiment 1. At termination of Experiment 2 (31 wk of age), 54% of chickens harboring EV21 were viremic tolerant compared with 5% of chickens lacking EV21 after inoculation with ALV-J at hatch. The data indicate that genetic differences among lines of white leghorn chickens, including the presence or absence of EV21, can influence response of chickens to infection with ALV-J.#FRE#
