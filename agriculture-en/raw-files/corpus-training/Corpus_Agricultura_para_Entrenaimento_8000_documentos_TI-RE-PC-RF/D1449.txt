#ITI#Mulch N recycling in green manure leys under Scandinavian conditions#FTI#
#IRE#Nitrogen (N) recycling to the regrowth of mulched red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and mulched mixed red clover/perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) leys was determined in field experiments during three consecutive years using 15N-labelled shoot material. Nitrogen recycling was greater in the pure clover stands than in the mixed stands in the beginning of the growing season, but increased successively in the mixed stands so that it was similar (14-15.5%) in both stands at the end of the season. This recycling of N from the mulch led to increased biomass accumulation but did not alter stand composition in the mixed stands. Mulch-derived N was incorporated into the soil organic N in both pure clover and mixed stands which thus contributed to building up soil fertility. An approximately similar proportion of N remained unaccounted for in mulched pure clover and mixed stand leys and presumably represented gaseous losses. To exploit the benefits of green manure leys in the humid temperate zone while minimising the negative environmental impact, these should be harvested rather than mulched. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
