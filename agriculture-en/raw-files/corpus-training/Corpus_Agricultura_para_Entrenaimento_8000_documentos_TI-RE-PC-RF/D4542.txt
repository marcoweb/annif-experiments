#ITI#Metastatic melanoma appearing to originate from the beak of a racing pigeon (Columba livia)#FTI#
#IRE#A 12-year-old male pigeon (Columba livia) was reported to have a small lesion on the lower beak, which was diagnosed as malignant melanoma. After surgery to remove it, the general condition of the bird worsened and the bird died. Post mortem examination revealed gross, black-colored lesions in the liver, kidney, spleen, and femur bone marrow. Lesions were not found in the adrenals. Histopathologically, the neoplastic cells had a large amount of melanin pigment and showed severe anisokaryosis and prominent nucleoli. Mitotic activity was infrequent but varied considerably where it was observed. Â© 2010 American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
