#ITI#Crop water deficit estimation and irrigation scheduling in western Jilin province, Northeast China#FTI#
#IRE#Jilin province is one of the main dryland grain production areas in China. Recently, limited supplemental irrigation, using groundwater in the semi-arid western area of the province, has developed rapidly to improve the low grain productivity caused by rainfall variability. Research was conducted to estimate the actual crop water requirements and identify the timing and magnitude of water deficits of the main crops such as corn (Zea mays L.), soybean (Glycine max L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). Using the guidelines for computing crop water requirements in FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper 56 and historical rainfall distributions, the crop water requirements, ETc and the crop water deficits of corn, soybean and sorghum were calculated. Based on the water deficit analysis, a recommended average supplemental irrigation schedule was developed. Crop production was compared to full irrigation and to a rainfed control in a field experiment. On average, compared to the rainfed control, the full irrigation and the average supplemental irrigation treatments of corn, increased yields 49.0 and 43.9%, respectively; soybean yields of those treatments increased by 41.0 and 34.7%, and sorghum yields of those treatments increased by 55.5 and 46.3%. A supplemental irrigation schedule can be used in the semi-arid western Jilin province to improve crop yields. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
