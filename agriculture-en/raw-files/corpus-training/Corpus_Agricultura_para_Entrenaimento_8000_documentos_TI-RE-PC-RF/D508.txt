#ITI#Synthesis of phytostabilized zinc oxide nanoparticles and their effects on physiological and anti-oxidative responses of Zea mays (L.) under chromium stress#FTI#
#IRE#Chromium (Cr) is a hazardous metal that has a significant risk of transfer from soil to edible parts of food crops, including shoot tissues. Reduction of Cr accumulation is required to lower the risk of Cr-exposed in humans and animals feeding on metal-contaminated parts of such plant. Zea mays is a global staple crop irrigated intensively with Cr-contaminated water. Consequently, the objective of this study was to investigate that FI-stabilized ZnO NPs could be used as an eco-friendly and efficient amendment to reduced Cr uptake and toxicity in Zea mays. To investigate the growth parameters, physiological, oxidative stress and biochemical parameters under different Cr-VI concentrations (10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 ppm). Cr exposed Z. mays plants exhibited substantially reduced plant biomass, chlorophyll contents, and altered antioxidant enzyme activity compared to untreated control. The results revealed that foliar application of Fagonia-ZnO-NPs helps eliminate the harmful effects of Cr (VI), which can enter plants through soil pollution. Increased levels of proline, soluble sugars and various antioxidant enzymes reflected this. Mean comparisons showed that Cr stress led to a 33–50% reduction in fresh shoot weight, 73–170% in fresh root weight, 16–34% shoot length, 9.5–129% root length, Chlorophyll contents 20–33% (Chl a), 18–27% (Chl b) and 17–27% (car), 14–33% total soluble sugars, 54–170% proline content, 7–7.5% POD, 0.66–75% CAT and 32–77% APX enzyme activities compared to untreated plants. Application of FI-stabilized ZnO NPs led to an increase 21–77% in fresh shoot weight, 22–45%, fresh root weight, 3–35% shoot length, 24–154% root length, Chlorophyll contents 39–60% (Chl a), 15–79% (Chl b) and 28–82% (car), 19–52% total soluble sugars, 21–55% proline content, 14–43% POD, 34–95% CAT and 130–186% APX enzyme activities under 10, 15 and 20 ppm Cr stress respectively, compared to Cr-treated plants. However, the principal component analysis revealed that chlorophyll contents, carotenoid, CAT, APX and length were in the same group and showed a positive correlation. These data collectively suggest that phytostabilized zinc oxide NPs may be an eco-friendly solution to mitigate Cr toxicity in agricultural soils and crop plants. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
