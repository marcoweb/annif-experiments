#ITI#Monitoring of Gram Pod Borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) through Pheromone Traps in Different Modules of Short Duration Pigeonpea#FTI#
#IRE#Present investigations were carried out during Kharif season of 2013-14 and 2014-15 at the Agricultural Research Farm, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi to monitor the population of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) by using pheromone traps and to start appropriate control measures in time. The maximum numbers of moth catches were recorded during 44th (16.8 pheromone trap-1) and 45th (19.5 pheromone trap-1) standard week in all the modules during Kharif 2013 and 2014. Relationship between pheromone trap catches and egg population was found significant and positively correlated in all modules except M3 during 2013. In the succeeding year 2014, the correlation between pheromone trap catches and egg population was positive and significant only in case of M5. The correlation between pheromone trap catches and larval population was positive in all modules but significant in case of M1 during 2013. In the succeeding year 2014, the correlation between pheromone trap catches and larval population was positive in all modules but significant only in M5. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
