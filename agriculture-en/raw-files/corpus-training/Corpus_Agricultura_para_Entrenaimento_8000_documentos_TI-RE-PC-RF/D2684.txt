#ITI#A Novel Seed Priming Technique for Enhancing Seed Vigour and Yield Potential in Marginal Vigour Seeds of Blackgram (Vigna mungo L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Seed priming is controlled hydration and dehydration that results in improved seed quality and yield. However, hydration-dehydration of fresh seeds would result in soaking injury especially in legumes. The disadvantage reported in pulses can overcome through pre-conditioning of seeds which allows the seeds to slow hydration and prevent the soaking injury. The conditioning of seeds in large scale is tedious and skill oriented. To overcome this problem, an innovative seed priming technology is essential for pulses to enhance the seed germination, vigour and seed yield. Methods: Experiment was carried out at National Pulses Research Centre, Vamban during 2016-18. Seed priming technology was developed by using marginal vigour lot of blackgram. The marginal vigour seeds were packed in gunny bag up to 3/4th level and soaked in water for 2 h and 4 h and incubated for 2 h, 4 h and 6 h. After the incubation period, seeds were dried back to original moisture content (9.0%) and seed quality parameters were analyzed. The best performing organic priming concentrations under laboratory were forwarded to field trial and yield parameters were assessed. Result: Marginal vigour lot of blackgram seeds packed in gunny bag and soaked in seaweed extract @ 0.4% for 2 h and incubated for 4 h significantly increased the seed quality parameters. Among the various organic priming, marginal vigour lot of blackgram seeds packed in gunny bag and soaked in seaweed extract @ 0.4% for 2 h and incubated for 4 h significantly increased the seed quality parameters and yield over hydro priming and control.
