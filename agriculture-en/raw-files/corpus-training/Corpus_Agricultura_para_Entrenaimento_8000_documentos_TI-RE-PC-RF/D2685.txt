#ITI#Increasing Productivity and Profitability of Summer Mungbean through Cluster Frontline Demonstrations in Sonipat, Haryana#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Cluster frontline demonstrations on summer mungbean were conducted at farmers’ fields in 2018-19 and 2019-20 in Sonipat district of Haryana state. Crop yield and returns of demonstrations were compared to those obtained in the local check plots. Adoption of improved practices of crop production in demonstration plots increased the crop yield by 30% over local check. Methods: A total number of 150 cluster front line demonstrations (CFLDs) were conducted in 60 ha. area during 2019 and 2020. A survey to get information on summer mungbean cultivation practices was undertaken before conducting the demonstrations. Selection of farmers and improved practices for demonstrations were done on the basis of survey information. Result: The average yield recorded in the demonstration and local check plots was 580 kg/ha and 447 kg/ha, respectively. This increase in yield was recorded with additional expenditure of Rs. 2285/ha. Net returns, additional returns and benefit cost ratio in demonstrations came out to be Rs. 13076/ha, 3073/ha and 1.77, respectively. The extension and technology gaps were recorded as 132.5 and 920.0 kg/ha, respectively. The technology index of 61.3% strongly indicated the technology inadequacies in the crop cultivation. The results of demonstrations revealed that low level of productivity at farmers’ fields could be increased to sustainable level by adoption of improved practices. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
