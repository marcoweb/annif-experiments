#ITI#DNA fingerprinting of vegetable soybean cultivar ‘Zhexian no.9’ using 101 new developed HRM-based SNP markers#FTI#
#IRE#Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been proved to be powerful markers in genetic analysis due to their high abundance and polymorphism in plant genomes. The recently developed high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis method provides a novel, quick, and close-tube PCR approach to analyze SNP variations. In present study, 101 HRM-based SNP markers from 20 soybean chromosomes were developed for genotyping vegetable soybean cultivar ‘Zhexian No.9’ with ‘Williams 82’ as reference. 33.7% of these markers were polymorphic between ‘Zhexian No.9’ and ‘Williams 82’. Polymorphic markers were found on 85% (17 of 20) of the soybean chromosomes when comparing ‘Zhexian No.9’ and ‘Williams 82’. Finally, an array of 101 in-sequence nucleotide letters was generated as the first precise SNP fingerprint of ‘Zhexian No.9’. The described marker-developing methodology could be used in other crops with known genomic information. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
