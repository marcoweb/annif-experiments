#ITI#Principles of development of a mass balance N cycle model for temperate grasslands: An Irish case study#FTI#
#IRE#Because of current environmental legislation in European grass-based farming, there is a need to develop tools that can link nitrogen (N) production with losses to the environment. A mass balance empirical model (NCYCLE) is proposed to fulfil this role. This study describes the principles and stages to develop a mass balance N cycle model for Irish grasslands using the basis of the existing NCYCLE model. The model was reconstructed and validated using empirical data from herbage cutting experiments in different Irish conditions and new functions were incorporated to improve the predictions. Irish data on agroclimatic regions and atmospheric deposition were used to provide site specific calculations. Outputs from the model are presented and appear to agree reasonably well with measured data from Ireland. Â© Springer 2006.#FRE#
