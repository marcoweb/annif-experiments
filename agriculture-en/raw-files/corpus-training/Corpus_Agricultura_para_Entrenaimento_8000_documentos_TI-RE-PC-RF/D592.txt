#ITI#Phosphorus-induced greater enhancement in carbon supply and storage for oil synthesis during the crucial period made cottonseed kernel oil yield have a higher increment than protein#FTI#
#IRE#Cottonseed has a high utilization value due to its luxuriant oil and protein, but low phosphorus (P) in cropland reduces its yield and quality. A limited understanding of the physiological mechanism underlying these results restricted the exploration of P efficient management in cotton cultivation. A 3-year experiment was performed with Lu 54 (low-P sensitive) and Yuzaomian 9110 (low-P tolerant) under 0 (deficient-P), 100 (critical-P), and 200 (excessive-P) kg P2O5 ha−1 in a field having 16.9 mg kg−1 available P to explore the key pathway for P to regulate cottonseed oil and protein formation. P application markedly increased cottonseed oil and protein yields, with the enhanced acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate contents during 20–26 days post anthesis being a vital reason. Notably, during the crucial period, decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity weakened the carbon allocation to protein, making malonyl-CoA content increase greater than free amino acid; Meanwhile, P application accelerated the carbon storage in oil but retarded that in protein. Consequently, cottonseed oil yield increased more than protein. Oil and protein synthesis in Lu 54 was more susceptible to P, resulting in greater increments in oil and protein yields than Yuzaomian 9110. Based on acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate contents (the key substrates), the critical P content in the subtending leaf to cotton boll needed by oil and protein synthesis in Lu 54 (0.35%) was higher than Yuzaomian 9110 (0.31%). This study provided a new perception of the regulation of P on cottonseed oil and protein formation, contributing to the efficient P management in cotton cultivation. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
