#IRE#Pulses are integral part of Indians diet so there is significant need to improve the productivity of pulses for their per capita availability. A research experiment was conducted in kharif 2015, at student research farm, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, Punjab to assess the radiation utilization and productivity of pigeon pea with respect to different row spacings and varieties. It was found that 60 x 21cm gave significant results in photosynthetically active radiation interception (PARI), canopy temperature, yield and yield components which were due to efficient GDD than other crop geometries. Similarly, determinate variety AL 15 performed significantly better than indeterminate variety PAU 881 in yield contributing components, yield and radiation use efficiency. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
