#ITI#Tolerance to salinity stress in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) through osmotic adjustment and undamaged chloroplast#FTI#
#IRE#A pot experiment was conducted under glass house condition to study the mechanism of salt tolerance in peanut at Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear Agriculture, Mymensingh, during February to July 2006. Two Spanish type varieties, Dacca-1 and Binachinabadam-3, and 1 Valencia type variety, Zhingabadam with unknown tolerance were exposed to 0.4 (unstressed), 3, 5, 7 and 9 dS/m doses of salinity at vegetative and flowering stages. The experiment was laid out in a factorial completely randomized design. It appeared that Binachinabadam-3 allocated higher assimilate to kernel at both vegetative and flowering stages through maintaining total sugar and chlorophyll 'a' contents close to unstressed treatment, particularly at 3-5 dS/m salinity doses.#FRE#
