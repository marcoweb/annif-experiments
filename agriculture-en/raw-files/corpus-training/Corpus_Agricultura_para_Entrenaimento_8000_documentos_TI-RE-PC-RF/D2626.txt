#ITI#Effect of Organic and Inorganic Nutrient Sources on Growth, Yield, Nutrient Uptake and Economics of Fodder Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.]#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was conducted to evaluate the varying organic and inorganic nutrient sources on fodder cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] in the kharif of 2017 at ICAR-NDRI, Karnal. The result revealed that application of 100% RDF (N,P,K) along with biofertilizers (rhizobium, PSB, potassium and zinc solubilizer bacteria) (T6) gave significantly (P<0.05) higher in plant height (204.6 cm), primary branches (6.1), root length (24.47 cm), green matter yield (334.5 q ha-1), CGR (8.13 g m-2 day-1), RGR (4.68 g g-1 day-1), K content (1.45%) in plant, P uptake (23.01 kg ha-1) and K uptake (86.04 kg ha-1) and available Zn status (0.465 ppm) in soil, after harvesting of the crop. However, N content (2.93%) in plant, N uptake (172.51 kg ha-1) and Zn uptake (192.03 g ha-1) was maximum with the application of 66.67% RDF along with biofertilizers consortium (T7). Application of 100% RDF along with PSB (T3) recorded highest number of nodule (33), P content in plant (0.389%) and available P status (24.76 g ha-1) in soil, after harvest. Further studies that, available N status (208.03 kg h-1), K status (221.27 kg ha-1) in soil, after harvest and Zn content (33.31 ppm) in plant were significantly higher with these treatments like T8-15 N, 60 P2 O5, 40 K2 O kg ha-1 along with rhizobium, T4-100% RDF along with K solubilizer and T11-FYM 5 t ha-1 with biofertilizers, respectively. In context of the economics of fodder cowpea production, highest gross return (Rs. 53525 ha-1) was obtained from T6 while maximum net return (Rs. 31351 ha-1) and benefit-cost ratio (1.45) were worked out maximum with the treatment T7. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
