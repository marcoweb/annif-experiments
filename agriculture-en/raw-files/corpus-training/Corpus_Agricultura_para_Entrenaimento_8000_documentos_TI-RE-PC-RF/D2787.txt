#ITI#Assessment of genetic variability and correlation of important yield related traits in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Thirty chickpea genotypes were studied for seed yield and its components for estimating genetic variability and correlation co-efficient. Analysis of variance for seed yield and its component showed significant differences among the genotypes for all nine traits. Highly significant and positive genotypic association between primary branches/plant and pods/plant, plant height and days to maturity, days to maturity and pods/plant, seeds/pod and days to 50% flowering, days to maturity and seed yield/plant and similarly 100 seed weight and seed yield/plant were found. Highly significant and negative genotypic correlation between primary branches/plant and plant height; primary branches/plant and plant width; primary branches/plant and days to 50% flowering; primary branches/plant and days to maturity; plant height and plant width; plant height and pods/plant; seeds/pod and 100 seed weight; days to 50% flowering and 100 seed weight were observed. The correlation between 100 seed weight and seed yield showed highest correlation coefficient 0.681 **. This 100 seed weight may be an important criterion for seed yield improvement in chickpea.#FRE#
