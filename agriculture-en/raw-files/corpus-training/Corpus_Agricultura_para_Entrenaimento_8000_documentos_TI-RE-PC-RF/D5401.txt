#ITI#Survival of avian influenza virus H7N2 in SPF chickens and their environments#FTI#
#IRE#The survival or clearance of the avian influenza virus (AIV) of subtype H7N2 in its chicken host was evaluated using experimentally infected specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens of different age groups. Birds of different ages were successfully infected with infectious doses ranging between 10 4.7 and 105.7 ELD50 per bird. In infected birds, the infective virus was undetectable usually by the third week following exposure. The infectivity or inactivation time of the HTN2 AIV in various environmental conditions was studied using chicken manure, heat, ethanol, pH, and disinfectants. The H7N2 AIV was effectively inactivated by field chicken manure in less than a week at an ambient temperature of 15-20°C. At a pH 2, heating at 56°C, and exposure to 70% ethanol or a specific disinfectant, the AIV infectivity was destroyed in less than 30 min.#FRE#
