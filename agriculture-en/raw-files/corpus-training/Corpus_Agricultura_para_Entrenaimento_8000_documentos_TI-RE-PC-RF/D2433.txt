#ITI#Influence of soil application of organic manures and foliar spray of organic nutrients on resultant seed quality in kabuli chickpea (Cicer arietinum l.) varieties#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was conducted to study the influence of soil application of organic manures and foliar spray of organic nutrients on resultant seed quality in Kabuli chickpea varieties. The experiment was carried at Seed Quality and Research Laboratory, Seed Unit (National Seed Project), University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad during rabi of 2015-16 and 2016-17. Seed quality parameters were significantly influenced among varieties and organic amendment treatments. BG1105 (V1) recorded significantly higher seed quality parameters as compared to MNK-1 (V2), While among the treatments, application of 100% organics equivalent to RDP [50% Farm yard manure (FYM) and 50% Vermicompost] + Foliar application of Panchagavya @ 3% at flowering and 15 Days after flowering (T2) recorded significantly higher seed quality parameters as compared to all other treatments and control. This treatment can be used to improve seed quality attributes in kabuli chickpea varieties. Â© 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
