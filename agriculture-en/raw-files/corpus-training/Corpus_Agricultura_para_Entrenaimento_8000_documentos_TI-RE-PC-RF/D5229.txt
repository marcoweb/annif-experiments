#ITI#Histomoniasis in the bursa of Fabricius of chickens#FTI#
#IRE#Histomoniasis was diagnosed in a flock of 6-wk-old commercial chickens. Clinical signs included depression, stilted gait, inappetence, and a slight increase in mortality. At necropsy, there were pale-yellow to dark-gray circular and depressed necrotic lesions in the liver. The ceca were enlarged and impacted with caseous cores. Cecal worms were not observed either at necropsy or on histopathology. Histomonads were demonstrated microscopically within the bursa of Fabricius in addition to the liver, ceca, and spleen. This is the first report of the presence of histomonads in the bursa of Fabricius in commercial chickens.#FRE#
