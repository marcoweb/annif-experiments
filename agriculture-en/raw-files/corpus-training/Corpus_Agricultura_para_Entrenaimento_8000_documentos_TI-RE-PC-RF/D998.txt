#ITI#Cross-talk between antioxidant production and secondary metabolite biosynthesis under combined effects of ozone stress and nitrogen amendments: A case study of lemongrass#FTI#
#IRE#The present experiment was done to study the interactive effects of soil nitrogen (N) amendments and elevated ozone (O3) (N–O3) on a medicinal plant, lemongrass [Cymbopogon flexuosus (Steud.) (Wats.)]. The experiment used two doses of inorganic soil nitrogen (N1, recommended and N2, 1.5-times recommended dose) in open-top chambers under ambient and elevated (ambient + 15 ppb and ambient + 30 ppb) O3 conditions. To analyze various characteristics, samples were collected at 45 and 90 days after transplantation (DAT). Additionally, at 110 days after transplantation (DAT), the metabolite contents of the leaves and essential oils were analyzed. The present study aims to investigate the mechanistic approach involving the crosstalk between antioxidant production and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in lemongrass upon N–O3 interactions. The present experiment showed that N amendments can be an efficient measure to manage O3 injury in plants, along with ensuring a balance between primary and secondary metabolic pathways, thus sustaining the plant defense and production of bioactive compounds, simultaneously. Under N–O3, not only the Halliwell asada pathway was stimulated resulting in the increased activities and concentrations of antioxidant pools; the shikimate, phenylpropanoid and mevalonic acid pathways were also invigorated, producing more number and contents of secondary metabolites (SMs), compared with plants that were not treated with N doses. This study suggests that soil nitrogen amendments will improve the therapeutic qualities of lemongrass, along with the strengthening of its antioxidant machinery, upon exposure to O3 stress. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
