#ITI#Photosynthetic compensation of maize in heterogeneous light is impaired by restricted photosynthate export#FTI#
#IRE#When a plant is exposed to heterogeneous light, the photosynthesis of unshaded leaves is often stimulated to compensate for the decline in photosynthesis of shaded leaves, i.e., photosynthetic compensation. However, a decline of photosynthesis in unshaded leaves, which means an impairment of photosynthetic compensation, has also been widely reported. Herein, two cultivars of maize (Zea mays L.), ‘Rongyu1210’ (RY) and ‘Zhongdan808’ (ZD), were studied comparatively. Both cultivars performed evident photosynthetic compensation under heterogeneous light (HL) as the light phase begins (8:30 a.m.). However, as the light phase continues (10:30 a.m.), an impairment of photosynthetic compensation took place in HL-treated ZD, but not in HL-treated RY. For both cultivars, nitrogen content of unshaded leaves was higher under HL, indicating a preferential nitrogen distribution towards unshaded leaves. This is related to the photosynthetic compensation but not the cause of the impairment. In addition, no obvious difference was found in the response of photosynthates (sucrose and starch) to HL between cultivars at 8:30 a.m. However, at 10:30 a.m., the content of photosynthates decreased significantly in unshaded leaves of HL-treated RY, along with increased abundances of both sucrose transporters (SUTs) and H+-ATPase (EC 7.1.2.1). In contrast, it increased along with decreased abundances of SUTs and H+-ATPase in HL-treated ZD. These results suggest that the photosynthetic compensation is impaired when photosynthates export of unshaded leaves is restricted. This suggestion is further confirmed by the results of 13C labeling and dry weight detection on young leaves as ‘sink’. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
