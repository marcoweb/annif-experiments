#ITI#The histone deacetylase SRT2 enhances the tolerance of chrysanthemum to low temperatures through the ROS scavenging system#FTI#
#IRE#Low temperatures can severely affect plant growth and reduce their ornamental value. A family of plant histone deacetylases allows plants to cope with both biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we screened and cloned the cDNA of DgSRT2 obtained from transcriptome sequencing of chrysanthemum leaves under low-temperature stress. Sequence analysis showed that DgSRT2 belongs to the sirtuin family of histone deacetylases. We obtained the stable transgenic chrysanthemum lines OE-2 and OE-12. DgSRT2 showed tissue specificity in wild-type chrysanthemum and was most highly expressed in leaves. Under low-temperature stress, the OE lines showed higher survival rates, proline content, solute content, and antioxidant enzyme activities, and lower relative electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide ion accumulation than the wild-type lines. This work suggests that DgSRT2 can serve as an essential gene for enhancing cold resistance in plants. In addition, a series of cold-responsive genes in the OE line were compared with WT. The results showed that DgSRT2 exerted a positive regulatory effect by up-regulating the transcript levels of cold-responsive genes. The above genes help to increase antioxidant activity, maintain membrane stability and improve osmoregulation, thereby enhancing survival under cold stress. It can be concluded from the above work that DgSRT2 enhances chrysanthemum tolerance to low temperatures by scavenging the ROS system. Â© 2024#FRE#
