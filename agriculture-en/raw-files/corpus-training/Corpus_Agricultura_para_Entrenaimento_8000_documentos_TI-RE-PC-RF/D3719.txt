#ITI#Effect of gamma radiation on growth and development of rust red flour beetle tribolium castaneum (Herbst.)#FTI#
#IRE#Study on the sterilizing and lethal effects of Cobalt-60 gamma radiation on the larval and adult stages of rust red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Herbst.) was done at 0, 10, 30, 50, 70, 100, 150, 300 and 500 gray (Gy). Irradiation severely affected pupal period, pupal formation and survivability of larvae and adults. The developmental period of the pest was found to increase along with the increase in the radiation doses. The irradiation at 70 Gy was found to cause complete sterility in the insect.#FRE#
