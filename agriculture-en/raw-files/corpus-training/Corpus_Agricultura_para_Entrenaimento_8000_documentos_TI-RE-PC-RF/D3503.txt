#ITI#First report of colletotrichum gloeosporioides on jasminum grandiflorum in India#FTI#
#IRE#Anthracnose disease symptoms were observed on Jasminum grandiflorum. The spots were dark red and mostly irregular shaped lesions on leaves. Acervuli containing masses of spores and dark setae were observed within lesions. The fungus after purification was identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. This is the first report from India and elsewhere showing that C. gloeosporioides causes anthracnose on J. grandiflorum.#FRE#
