#ITI#Impact Assessment of Front Line Demonstrations on Summer Mung Productivity under Irrigated Agro-ecosystem of Haryana#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Summer mung proved to be an effective crop in improving soil health, providing additional income to the farmers, works as catch crop and fits in paddy-wheat crop rotation in Northern India. Its cultivation leads to increase in house hold income of the farmers and contributed to nutritional security in rural India. The present study was carried out by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Sonepat in its adopted villages. Methods: A total number of 159 front line demonstrations (FLDs) were conducted on summer mung in 75.2 hectare area using improved variety MH-421 during summer 2017 and 2018 after harvesting of wheat and prior to paddy transplanting to show case improved production technologies on farmers’ field specifically under paddy-wheat rotation. The production, productivity and economic returns of summer mung in demonstrations and farmers’ practice were compared and different yield gaps were analyzed. Result: Average yield of demonstration plots was recorded significantly higher by 20.0 per cent and 21.3 per cent in summer 2017 and 2018, respectively. The extension gap was 1.75 q/ha and 1.90 q/ha while technology gap was 1.5 q/ha and 1.2 q/ha in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The additional economic returns for farmers ranged from Rs. 2907/ha to Rs. 3200/ha as a results of these FLDs. Hence, adoption of improved summer mung cultivation practices contributed to better yield and higher economic returns under paddy-wheat rotation after harvesting of wheat crop. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
