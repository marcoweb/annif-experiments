#ITI#Effect of rhizobium inoculation to nodulation and growth of soybean [glycine max (L.) merrill] germplasm#FTI#
#IRE#Nitrogen is an important macronutrient mineral that is needed in the largest amount by the plant and is the main limiting factor for plant development. Rhizobium is a group of bacteria capable of providing nutrients for soybean crops. When symbiotic with legume crops, this group of bacteria is able to infect plant roots and form root nodules. The study aimed to investigate the effect of Rhizobium on nodulation and growth of some soybean germplasm. The results showed no interaction between the inoculation treatment and the genotype. The significant effect of inoculation was shown by the number of nodules, nodule dry weight, root length, and root dry weight. Inoculation did not affect plant height and shoot dry weight. These traits were more influenced by genetic factors. In the condition without inoculation, the root length was higher but the root dry weight was lower. Plant height differed between the genotypes. KPT5 and KPT6 showed the highest plant height than any other genotypes. Both genotypes also had the highest shoot dry weight. The highest shoot dry weight was also achieved by KPT4. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
