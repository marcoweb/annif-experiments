#ITI#Development of RAPD/SCAR marker for yellow mosaic disease resistance in blackgram#FTI#
#IRE#A total of 130 random oligonucleotide primers were surveyed to identify yellow mosaic resistant genotypes in blackgram. Primer OPQ-1525 quences were used to design an allele-specific sequence characterized amplicon region primer SCAR (20f/r). The marker designed was amplified at a specific site of 532bp only in resistant genotypes. This would help for screening different genotypes and segregating generations in marker-assisted breeding programme.#FRE#
