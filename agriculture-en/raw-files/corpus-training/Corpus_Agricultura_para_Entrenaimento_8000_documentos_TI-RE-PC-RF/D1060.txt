#ITI#The E3 ubiquitin ligase COP1 regulates salt tolerance via GIGANTEA degradation in roots#FTI#
#IRE#Excess soil salinity significantly impairs plant growth and development. Our previous reports demonstrated that the core circadian clock oscillator GIGANTEA (GI) negatively regulates salt stress tolerance by sequestering the SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE (SOS) 2 kinase, an essential component of the SOS pathway. Salt stress induces calcium-dependent cytoplasmic GI degradation, resulting in activation of the SOS pathway; however, the precise molecular mechanism governing GI degradation during salt stress remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that salt-induced calcium signals promote the cytoplasmic partitioning of CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1), leading to the 26S proteasome-dependent degradation of GI exclusively in the roots. Salt stress-induced calcium signals accelerate the cytoplasmic localization of COP1 in the root cells, which targets GI for 26S proteasomal degradation. Align with this, the interaction between COP1 and GI is only observed in the roots, not the shoots, under salt-stress conditions. Notably, the gi-201 cop1-4 double mutant shows an enhanced tolerance to salt stress similar to gi-201, indicating that GI is epistatic to COP1 under salt-stress conditions. Taken together, our study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the COP1-mediated proteasomal degradation of GI for salt stress tolerance, raising new possibilities for developing salt-tolerant crops. © 2024 The Authors.
