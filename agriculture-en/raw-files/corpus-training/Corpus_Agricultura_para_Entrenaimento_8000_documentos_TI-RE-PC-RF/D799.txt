#ITI#Regulation of carotenoid metabolism and ABA biosynthesis during blueberry fruit ripening#FTI#
#IRE#Carotenoids and their derivates play critical physiologic roles in plants. However, these substrates and their metabolism have not been elucidated in fruit of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum). In this study, carotenoids and ABA were investigated by LC-MS and their biosynthesis were subject to proteomic analysis during fruit ripening. Activity of CCD1 and NCED1/3 were studied in vivo or in vitro. Also, effects of ethephon and 1-MCP on biosynthesis of carotenoid and ABA were investigated through the expression of corresponding genes using qPCR. As a result, carotenoid biosynthesis was prominently mitigated whereas its metabolism was enhanced during fruit ripening, which resulted in a decrease in the carotenoids. VcCCD1 could both cleave β-carotene, zeaxanthin and lutein at positions of 9, 10 (9′, 10′), which was mainly responsible for the degradation of these carotenoids. Interestingly, in the situation of mitigation of carotenoid biosynthesis, ABA still rapidly accumulated, which was mainly attributed to the upregulated expression of VcNCED1/3. Notably, VcNCED1/3 also showed a cleavage activity of all-trans-zeaxanthin and a stereospecific cleavage activity of 9-cis-carotene to generate C15-carotenal. The C15-carotenal could be potentially converted to ABA through ZEP-independent ABA biosynthetic pathway during blueberry fruit ripening. Similar to a nature natural maturation, ethylene accelerated the carotenoid degradation and ABA biosynthesis trough downregulating the expression of genes in carotenoid biosynthesis and upregulating the expression of genes in ABA biosynthesis. These information help understand the regulation of carotenoids and ABA, and effects of ethylene on the regulation during blueberry fruit ripening. © 2023#FRE#
