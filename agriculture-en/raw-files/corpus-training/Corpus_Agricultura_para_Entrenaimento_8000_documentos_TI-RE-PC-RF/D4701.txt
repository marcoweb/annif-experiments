#ITI#Lesions associated with the plexus venosus subcutaneus collaris of pigeons with chlorophacinone toxicosis#FTI#
#IRE#We describe lesions in 29 adult domestic pigeons (Columba livia) poisoned with chlorophacinone, an indandione anticoagulant rodenticide. Birds were found dead in the field and in dovecotes after a wide-area treatment against common voles (Microtus arvalis) based on the dispersion in the open field of wheat grain treated with 0.005% chlorophacinone. At necropsy, most pigeons showed crops full of red-colored wheat grain, extensive subcutaneous hematoma in neck and breast zones, and hemorrhages in lungs and the coelomic cavity. Chlorophacinone was determined in liver samples by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection, and the mean (range) concentration was 11.2 (1.48-50.1) μg/g. Pigeons have a venous subcutaneous plexus in the neck zone (plexus venosus subcutaneus collaris), which has been described as an erectile tissue with a thermoregulation function. This case report describes a relationship between the subcutaneous hemorrhagic lesions and the plexus venosus collaris.#FRE#
