#ITI#Plant size directly correlates with water use efficiency in Arabidopsis#FTI#
#IRE#Plant transpiration is a fundamental process that determines plant water use efficiency (WUE), thermoregulation, nutrition, and growth. How transpiration impacts on such essential physiological aspects and how the environment modulates these effects are fundamental questions about which little is known. We investigated the genetic and environmental factors underlying natural variation in plant transpiration and water use efficiency in a population of natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions grown under homogeneous conditions. As expected, we observed large variation of total transpiration capacity, transpiration per surface unit, and WUE among A. thaliana accessions. Despite the variation of stomatal density and ABA content in the population, WUE did not correlate with any of these parameters. On the contrary, a surprising direct correlation was found between WUE and projected leaf area, with bigger plants displaying a more efficient use of water. Importantly, genome-wide association studies further supported our observations through the identification of several loci involved in WUE variation, mutations in which caused a simultaneous reduction in plant size and a decrease in WUE. Altogether, our results strongly suggest that, although WUE depends on many parameters, plant size is an adaptive trait with respect to water use in A. thaliana. © 2023 The Authors.
