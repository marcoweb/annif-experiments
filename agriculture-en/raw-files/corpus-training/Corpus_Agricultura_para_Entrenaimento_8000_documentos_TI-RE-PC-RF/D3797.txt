#ITI#Analysis of cyst and cone top morphometrics of Indian populations of maize cyst nematode#FTI#
#IRE#Hierarchical cluster analysis based on cyst and cone top morphometric means including cyst length, cyst width, cyst length to cyst width ratio, vulval slit length, vulval bridge length, vulval bridge breadth, under bridge breadth, length of fenestra, breadth of fenestra, distance from anus to fenestra and number of secondary bullae was used to learn more about cyst and cone top mor-phometric means and their relationships for six populations of Heterodera zeae from Indore, Ludhiana, Delhi, Udaipur, Kanpur and Samastipur by using SPSS 13 for Windows computer software (SPSS Inc.). Values of proximity matrix based on cluster analysis of morphometrics and the dendrograms visually illustrated the grouping and relationships among populations. Intra specific variations in the different characters of the cone top structure revealed that Indore and Samastipur populations of H. zeae were different as compared to other ones of H. zeae. Cluster analysis of cyst morphometrics showed that the populations of H. zeae from Kanpur and Delhi were different as compare to other four ones.#FRE#
