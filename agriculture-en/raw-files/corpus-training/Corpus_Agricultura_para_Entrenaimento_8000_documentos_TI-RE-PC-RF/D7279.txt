#ITI#Assesment of water productivity using different drip irrigation systems for cotton#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this study is to evaluate water productivity (WP), economic water productivity (EWP) and land economic productivity (LEP) using different amount of irrigation water and different drip irrigation (surface drip irrigation, SDI) and subsurface drip irrigation, SSDI) for cotton. For that, the results of the experiment carried out in cotton growing season of 2016 and 2017 were evaluated. The maximum WPIrrig (0.84 kg m−3) occurred in the SSDI system at the lateral pipe depth of 40 cm. However, the net LEP (US$1109.9 ha−1) was in which the irrigation application (551.3 mm) had a calculated crop water requirement of 1.00 times using Penman-Monteith method. The maximum EWP (US$0.19 m−3) occurred also in the SSDI system with the lateral pipe depth of 40 cm. SSDI under the depth of 40 cm resulted in reducing water use and greater water productivity using an amount of irrigation water based on 1.0xCrop water requirement. Thus, this treatment was found to be more applicable in terms of farmer practices. WPIng, WP, EWP and LEP should be considered jointly for an optimization of water productivity and water saving in terms of farmers and irrigation schemes. © 2019#FRE#
