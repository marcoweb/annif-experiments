#ITI#Examining the socioeconomic impacts of irrigation in the Southeast Anatolia Region of Turkey#FTI#
#IRE#We explore the socioeconomic changes following implementation of an irrigation system in the Southeast Anatolia region of Turkey, and examines whether the improvement originally envisioned was achieved. We surveyed seven irrigated and eight non-irrigated villages in Sanliurfa Province, collecting several indicators at the household level, including crop patterns, household living standards, and access to water. Local perception of the irrigation project and decisions regarding water use also are examined. The irrigation projects have improved knowledge sharing of irrigation technology and helped to introduce the sharing of agricultural machinery. The projects also seem to have shifted the tribal hierarchy toward peer relationships. While positive changes are observed in irrigated villages, there remain socioeconomic problems that need to be addressed, such as water user association management and salinization.
