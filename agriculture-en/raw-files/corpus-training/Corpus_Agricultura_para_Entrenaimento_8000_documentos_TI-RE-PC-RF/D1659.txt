#ITI#Magnesium fertilization has a greater impact on soil and leaf nutrient concentrations than nitrogen or calcium fertilization in Florida orange production#FTI#
#IRE#Citrus production has been declining in Florida since 2004, mainly because of Huanglongbing (HLB), a deadly disease that is affecting an increasingly large proportion of worldwide citrus production. Nutrients such as nitrogen, calcium, and magnesium play an important role in defense mechanisms and could extend the productive life of HLB-affected citrus trees, but interactions among these nutrients remain unclear. The main objective of this study was to determine the response of HLB-affected trees to N, Ca, and Mg applications, using Valencia trees (Citrus sinensis) on Swingle citrumelo (C. paradisi Macf. × P. trifoliata) rootstock established on a Candler fine sand. Applications of N at 168, 224 (current recommended rate), and 280 kg N ha−1 were the main plots. Split-plots consisted of a grower standard treatment receiving only basal Ca (51 kg ha−1) and Mg (56 kg ha−1); supplemental Ca only (total Ca inputs: 96 kg ha−1); supplemental Mg only (total Mg inputs: 101 kg ha−1); and supplemental Ca (total Ca inputs: 73.5 kg ha−1) and Mg (total Mg inputs: 78.5 kg ha−1). Leaf N, Mg and Ca concentrations, soil extractable Ca, Mg, NO3−-N and NH4+-N, and soil pH and base saturation were measured five times during an 18-month period. Different N rates did not affect leaf nutrient and soil extractable concentrations, and the application of Ca did not increase soil Ca extractable concentration relative to the grower standard, although it had weak effects on leaf Ca. In contrast, Mg was effective at increasing both leaf and soil Mg concentrations. Overall, our results suggest a greater impact of Mg fertilization on soil and nutrient concentrations than N or Ca fertilization, and limited evidence for strong interactions among these nutrients. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
