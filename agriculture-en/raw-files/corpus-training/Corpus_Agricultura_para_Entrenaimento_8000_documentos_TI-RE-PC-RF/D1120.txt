#ITI#Plant communication across different environmental contexts suggests a role for stomata in volatile perception#FTI#
#IRE#Plants can detect herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) from their damaged neighbours and respond by enhancing or priming their defenses against future herbivore attack. Plant communication and defense priming by volatile cues has been well documented, however, the extent to which plants are able to perceive and respond to these cues across different environmental contexts remains poorly understood. We investigated how abiotic changes that modulate stomatal conductance and/or defense signalling affect the ability of maize plants to perceive HIPVs and respond by priming their defenses. During light exposure, when stomata were open and conditions allowed for defense signal biosynthesis, the individual compounds indole and (Z)−3-hexenyl acetate primed maize defenses. Neither compound primed defenses under environmental conditions that closed stomata and/or altered defense signalling. Moreover, plants were not primed when exposed to indole or (Z)−3-hexenyl acetate in darkness (while stomata were closed) and then subjected to simulated herbivory in the light, to ensure defense induction. The full blend of HIPVs primed maize defenses in light conditions but suppressed defense induction during dark exposure and wounding. These findings indicate that environmental context is important for plant communication and defense priming and suggest that stomata play a role in plant perception of HIPVs. © 2023 The Authors.
