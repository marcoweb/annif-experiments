#ITI#Effect of Organic and Inorganic Fertilization on Growth and Yield of French Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Fiji#FTI#
#IRE#Background: French bean is used both as dry seeds or as green pod vegetable and it is in increasing demand throughout Fiji. Limited agronomical information is available for its cultivation which is one of the barriers in increasing its production in country. This research aimed to study the influence of organic and inorganic fertilizers on growth and yield of (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Fiji. Methods: This research was conducted during April to September 2018 in a randomized block design with three replications and seven treatments of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Observations on growth parameters and yield attributes were recorded and analyzed using analysis of variance technique. Result: Organic and inorganic fertilizers combinations significantly increase the growth and green pod yield of French bean. The applications of nutrient in combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers were found more effective than inorganic fertilizers or organic manure alone for growth and yield of French bean. The combination of 100% NPK (200 kg ha-1) along with Poultry manure @ 5 t ha-1 was found most effective for enhancing growth and yield. It was recorded that on the basis of yield and growth performance treatment 100% NPK along with PM @ 5 t ha-1 was superior. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
