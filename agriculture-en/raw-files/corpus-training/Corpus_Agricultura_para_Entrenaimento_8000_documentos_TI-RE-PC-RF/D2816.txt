#ITI#Isolation of high yielding lines associated with Fusarium wilt resistance in Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan)#FTI#
#IRE#High yielding pigeonpea lines which are associated with Fusarium wilt resistance were isolated from the experiments conducted at UAS, Dharwad and ARS, Gulbarga during 2009 - 2012. The efforts could able to isolate transgressive wilt resistant plants in F2 and high yielding resistant recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from population derived from 'Maruti' X 'GS-1.' Lines/plants were selected based on seed yield and yield related traits such as 100 seed weight and no.of pods per plant. Phenotyping 288 F2 plants for yield related traits and screening F2:3 for fusarium wilt reaction could able to isolate 10 transgressive wilt resistant plants in F2 which range in seed yield from 169.15 to 217.78 g/plant and 100 seed weight from 9.14 to 13.57g. Accordingly, two high yielding wilt resistant RILs, 109 and 243 were isolated with seed yield of 15.33 and 13.65 q/ha, respectively.#FRE#
