#ITI#Hydrochemical and stable isotopic assessment of groundwater quality and its variations in rice-growing areas in East China#FTI#
#IRE#Agricultural activities are frequently associated with water contamination. Thus, the development of efficient strategies for groundwater protection in agricultural areas requires an assessment of the contaminants. Given this perspective, groundwater quality monitoring is carried out in a rice-growing area in Hangjiahu Plain, East China. Thirty-two piezometers are installed to measure physico-chemical parameters such as major ions, field-measured parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen, and temperature), and δ15N isotopic ratios and their variations in space and time. The groundwater shows a variable chemical composition, e.g. EC ranged from 760 to 2,300 μS cm-1. Most groundwater is weakly acidic, and is characterized as Ca2+ + Na+- HCO3 - + SO4 2- + Cl- type. The results demonstrate NH4 + coming from agricultural activities and SO4 2- deriving from natural chemical inputs are the major contaminants in the groundwater at the study area. Correlations among NO3 -, NH4 + and K+ suggest that these ions come from the same source of fertilizer and indicate a significant degree of nitrification in the study area. The highly positive correlations among the variables of HCO3 -, SO4 2-, and Mg2+ indicated that these ions were derived from the same source of natural chemical inputs. Nitrate isotopic composition suggests that nitrate in groundwater originates from chemical fertilizers, manure, and soil organic matter. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
