#IRE#Combining ability analysis for yield and yield components of mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] was attempted using an 8 x 8 diallel mating system both in F1 and F2 generations. Both gca and sca mean squares were significant for all the eleven characters in F1 and F2 generations, former being more pronounced for clusters per plant, pods per cluster, pods per plant, pod length, seeds per pod, 100-seed weight and seed yield per plant in F1 and for all the characters except days to maturity, seeds per pod and 100-seed weight in F2. The parent K 851 was a good general combiner for seed yield per plant, days to maturity, plant height, primary branches per plant, clusters per plant, pods per plant and seeds per pod in both generations, while Pant-M 4 was good general combiner for seed yield per plant, plant height, pods per cluster and pods per plant over generations. Parents RMG 62 and Asha were the best combiners for early flowering. GM 4 had good general combining ability for seed yield in F1, but for pod length and 100-seed weight in F1 and F2. The crosses showing high sca effects for seed yield also had significant and positive effects for at least two important yield components. Â© 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
