#ITI#Morphological and genetic diversity among farmers’ varieties of urdbean (Vigna mungo l.) hepper of andaman and nicobar islands agro-ecosystem#FTI#
#IRE#The extent of morphological variation among farmers’ varieties of urdbean was assessed using 21 DUS and 9 agronomic parameters. A set of 56 farmers’ varieties collected from different parts of the Andaman Islands were assessed for genetic diversity. Cluster analysis assigned farmers’ varieties into groups on the basis of agronomic performance rather than their origin and was identified 9 homogeneous clusters, it was able to separate 56 farmers’ varieties based on morphological and agronomic traits. Using cluster analysis by unweighted pair group with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) method and grouping of all farmers’ varieties exhibited the presence of wide genetic diversity by the formation of 9 clusters. Cluste-I had maximum number of farmers’ varieties i.e. 26 while, cluster VIII had only one (ANFVU-11-29). The pattern of distribution of farmers’ varieties into clusters assigned on the basis of agro-morphological performance and demonstrating that geographical isolation may not be the only factor causing genetic diversity. Intra cluster distance analysis revealed that minimum intra cluster distance was observed in cluster I. The maximum inter cluster distance has to be found in cluster VIII and IX. Therefore, it was concluded that more emphasis should be given on cluster I, II, VIII and IX for selecting farmers’ varieties as parents for crossing with the farmers’ varieties of cluster I which may produce new recombinants with desired traits. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
