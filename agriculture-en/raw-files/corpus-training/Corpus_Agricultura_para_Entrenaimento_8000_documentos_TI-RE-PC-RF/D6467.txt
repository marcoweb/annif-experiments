#ITI#The role of intraspecific variation in bumblebee body size and behavior on buzz pollination of a tropical legume species#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: The outcomes of generalized mutualisms rely on partner trait variation. In pollination mutualisms, although less explored, intraspecific variation in pollinator traits can be pivotal for successful pollination. We investigated the role of intraspecific body size and behavioral trait variations of bumblebee Bombus morio on the pollination of a buzz-pollinated legume species, Chamaecrista latistipula. Methods: To explore the impact of body size and behavior of B. morio on the pollination of C. latistipula, we observed visits to virgin flowers and quantified the pollen removal and deposition (pollination performance) and fruit and seed production (reproductive fitness). By analyzing video and sound recordings, we measured B. morio body size and behavior on each flower, including bee vibration descriptors. Results: We observed intraspecific behavioral differences among B. morio bumblebees associated with different body sizes. Larger bumblebees had half the handling time and vibrational pulses, less angular displacement within flowers, and larger relative peak amplitudes during vibrations than smaller bumblebees did. Regardless of their large variation in size and behavior, bumblebees were equally effective in removing pollen and pollinating flowers. The high female reproductive fitness was independent of bumblebee body size and behavior, likely due to the interaction between both. On the other hand, larger bumblebees visited flowers for shorter periods, probably promoting higher male reproductive fitness. Conclusions: This study is the first to highlight the large intraspecific variation of bumblebee body size and behavior in buzz-pollinated flowers in the field. Together, body size and behavior effects unexpectedly cancel each other, generating a high buzz pollination efficiency. © 2023 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
