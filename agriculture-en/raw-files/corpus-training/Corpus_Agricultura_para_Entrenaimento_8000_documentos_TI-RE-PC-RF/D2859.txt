#ITI#Analysis of marketable and marketed surplus of red gram in Vadodara district of Gujarat#FTI#
#IRE#Present investigation was undertaken to estimate the marketable and marketed surplus of red gram and to identify the factors influencing them in Vadodara district of Gujarat. Required data were collected from 120 red gram growers spread over 10 villages of Karjan taluka during 2007-08. Multiple Regression technique was used to quantify the effect of the factors influencing marketable and marketed surplus. As red gram is market oriented crop, about 86 per cent of total production on an average was the marketable surplus and 77 per cent was marketed surplus. The results showed that marketable surplus was positively and significantly related with cropped area and average productivity in all the four categories of farms. It was negatively related with family size and quantity retained for wages in kind indicating inverse relationship between extent of marketable surplus and these factors. Further, in case of marketed surplus, the examination of individual coefficients revealed that marketed surplus was positively and significantly related with total production, current prices and financial obligation for sample as a whole while the family size showed negative sign indicating inverse relationship of marketed surplus with family size in sample farms.#FRE#
