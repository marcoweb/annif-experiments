#ITI#Morphophenological Characters and Productivity of Pigeon Pea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] as Influenced by Crop Geometry and Plant Growth Regulators#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Intensive cultivation with suitable crop geometry for optimum utilization of resources is one of the possible ways for increasing productivity of pigeonpea. Plant growth regulators have the capacity to stimulate and inhibit physiological processes, which directly or indirectly might affect crop yield and quality. This investigation was planned to study the influence of crop geometry and foliar application of plant growth regulators on production potential of pigeonpea. Methods: The field experiment was conducted at experimental farm of Agronomy Department, V.N.M.K.V., Parbhani, during kharif season of 2018 and 2019. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with four main plot treatments and five sub plot treatments. The main plot treatments comprised of four crop geometries while the sub plot treatments were five treatments on foliar application of plant growth regulatorsalongwith control. Result: Various crop geometries shown remarkable effect on growth and developement of pigeonpea. The crop geometry of 60-120 cm ☓ 20 cm and 90 cm ☓ 20 cm recorded maximum plant height of pigeonpea as compared to other wider crop geometries. While in case of all the other growth attributes viz. number of functional leaves plant-1, leaf area, number of branches plant-1 and dry matter accumulation plant-1 crop geometry of 120 cm ☓ 20 cm and 75-150 cm ☓ 20 cm were found superior as compared to othertreatments and were at par with each other. The yield per hectare was increased at closer crop geometry 60-120 cm ☓ 20 cm as the lower per plant yield was compensated by higher plant population. The crop geometry 60-120 cm ☓ 20 cm produced significantly higher seed yield (1661, 1982 and 1821 kg ha-1 during 2018, 2019 and pooled mean respectively) over crop geometry of 120 cm ☓ 20 cm and crop geometry 75-150 cm ☓ 20 cm, but it was found at par with crop geometry 90 cm ☓ 20 cm. Among the foliar application of plant growth regulators, growth characters viz., plant height, number of functional leaves, leaf area, number of branches and dry matter accumulation plant-1 as well as chlorophyll content were enhanced with the foliar application of Brassinosteroids @ 0.1 ppm and application of NAA @ 40 ppm during both the years of study. Foliar application of Brassinosteroids @ 0.1 ppm also recorded early flower initiation and significantly highest seed yield (1742, 2018 and 1880 kg ha-1 during 2018, 2019 and in pooled data, respectively), while it was at par with foliar application of NAA @ 40 ppm. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
