#ITI#Grape cytochrome P450 CYP90D1 regulates brassinosteroid biosynthesis and increases vegetative growth#FTI#
#IRE#Vine vigor or vegetative growth is an important factor related to berry quality and vinicultural training management, but brassinosteroid (BR)-induced molecular mechanisms underlying vine growth remain unclear. In this study, the hypothesis that the Vitis vinifera CYP90D1 gene VvCYP90D1, one of the genes for BR biosynthesis, plays a critical role in shoot elongation was tested. RNA sequencing analysis of shoots collected from the vigorous cultivar Koshu (KO) and the reference cultivar Pinot Noir (PN) 7 days after bud break showed higher expression levels of various genes in the BR biosynthesis pathway in KO than in PN. The VvCYP90D1 expression level in KO was highest in meristems, followed by internodes and leaves. Cluster analysis of amino acid sequences including those in other plant species showed that the isolated gene belonged to the CYP90D1 group. The vegetative growth and the endogenous BR (brassinolide; BL) content were significantly higher in VvCYP90D1-overexpressing Arabidopsis than in wild type. VvCYP90D1-overexpressing Arabidopsis treated with brassinazole (Brz), a BR biosynthesis inhibitor, showed recovery of vegetative growth. These results indicate that VvCYP90D1 in grapevine has a vegetative growth promoting effect via BR biosynthesis. Our findings on the mechanism of BR-induced grape shoot growth will contribute to the development of new shoot control techniques for grapevine. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
