#ITI#As prey and pollinators, insects increase reproduction and allow for outcrossing in the carnivorous plant Dionaea muscipula#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Understanding the factors that limit reproductive success is a key component of plant biology. Carnivorous plants rely on insects as both nutrient sources and pollinators, providing a unique system for studying the effects of both resource and pollen limitation on plant reproduction. Methods: We conducted a field experiment using wild-growing Dionaea muscipula J. Ellis (Droseraceae) in which we manipulated prey and pollen in a factorial design and measured flower production, number of fruits, and number of seeds. Because understanding reproduction requires knowledge of a plant species' reproductive and pollination biology, we also examined the pollination system, per-visit pollinator effectiveness, and pollen-ovule (P/O) ratio of D. muscipula. Results: Plants that received supplemental prey produced more flowers than control plants. They also had a higher overall fitness estimate (number of flowers × fruit set (total fruits/total flowers) × seeds per fruit), although this benefit was significant only when prey supplementation occurred in the previous growing season. Neither pollen supplementation nor the interaction between pollen and prey supplementation significantly affected overall plant fitness. Conclusions: This study reinforces the reliance of D. muscipula on adequate prey capture for flower, fruit, and seed production and a mobile pollen vector for reproduction, indicating the importance of considering insects as part of an effective conservation management plan for this species. © 2024 The Authors.
