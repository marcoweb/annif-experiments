#ITI#Importance of Legumes and Role of Sulphur Oxidizing Bacteria for Their Production: A Review#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Legumes are relatively cheap, non-animal good source of valuable proteins, micro-nutrients and vitamins in human and animal nutrition for many years. Recognizing the potential of legumes in achieving the sustainable solution to the global food security, protein access, eradicate hunger and malnutrition, FAO of the United Nations (The Food and Agriculture Organization), facilitated 2016 as the International Year of Pulses (grain legumes) under the banner ‘nutritious seeds for a sustainable future’. The nutrient, nitrogen and biological nitrogen fixation is very crucial for legume’s growth, besides sulphur deficiency is very sensitive to the nodulation and nitrogen fixation. Despite the amazing beneficial properties, legumes are neglected by most of us due to having tough competition with low price and high yielding cereal varieties. Methods: Therefore keeping in mind the above points, this review discusses the importance and application of legumes in different perspectives, legume cultivation patterns, importance of sulphur nutrition to legumes, role of sulphur oxidizing bacteria in sulphur nutrition, improving soil and environment, challenges and future of legumes. Conclusion: Legumes have variety of applications including food, health, environment and many other sectors but we are not able to produce enough amount according to their genetic potential due to inefficient breeding programs. Sulphur is an important nutrient along with N effecting its growth and yield. Sulphur oxidizing bacteria (SOB) have been proved as an important tool for improving yield and symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes. Therefor application of biofertilizers along with SOB and improved genetic breeding programmes may prove leading steps to enhance their production. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
