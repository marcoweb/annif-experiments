#ITI#Protective mechanisms of sulfur against arsenic phytotoxicity in Brassica napus by regulating thiol biosynthesis, sulfur-assimilation, photosynthesis, and antioxidant response#FTI#
#IRE#The contamination of agricultural soils with Arsenic (As) is a significant environmental stress that restricts plant growth, metabolism, and productivity worldwide. The present study examined the role of elemental sulfur (S0) in protecting Brassica napus plants from Arsenic (As) toxicity. Arsenic (100, and 200 mg As kg−1 soil) in soil caused detrimental effects on five Brassica napus cultivars (Neelam, Teri-Uttam Jawahar, Him Sarson, GSC-101, and NUDB 26–11). The As toxicity inhibited the growth and photosynthesis indices in all cultivars with more deterioration effects in NUDB 26–11. Plant absorption and uptake of As caused the generation of oxidative injury by accumulating the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which simultaneously decreased the plant defence capability and ultimately the photosynthesis. Application of sulfur (S0, 100 or 200 mg S kg−1 soil) alleviated the negative impacts and toxicity of As on the photosynthesis and growth matrices of plants, especially under high S level. S0 also boosted the antioxidant potential of plants and toned-down lipid peroxidation and ROS aggravation such as superoxide anion (O2•−) and H2O2, hydrogen peroxide, in As affected plants. In general, S0 at 200 mg kg−1 soil more perceptibly increased the functionality of antioxidant enzymes, and non-enzymatic antioxidants, metal chelators and non-protein thiols. Further amendment of soil with S0 at fifteen days before seed sowing affected by As-induced toxic effects (added to soil at the time of sowing) considerably intensified the endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) content and its regenerating enzymes D-cysteine desulfhydrase (DCD) and L-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD) that further strengthened the defense capability of plants to withstand As-stress. Our results suggest the role of H2S in the S-induced defense operation of the B. napus plants in restraining As toxicity. The current study shows that S0 as a source of S might be used to promote the growth of B. napus plants in polluted agricultural soils. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
