#ITI#Effects triggered by foliar selenium application on growth, enzyme activities, mineral nutrients and carbohydrates in lettuce under an aquaculture system#FTI#
#IRE#Se has beneficial effects on plants, through the stimulation of plant productivity, the reduction of abiotic stresses, and the improvement in N metabolism. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the foliar application of different concentrations of Se (0, 4, 8 and 16 μmol L−1) on lettuce plants grown in an aquaponics system (fish water) compared with a control (conventional soilless fertigation). The NO3- concentration supplied by the fish water was 47% of the control solution. The results showed a reduction in the fresh weight of lettuce plants irrigated with the fish water mixture treatment, along with an increase in sugar concentration. However, the application of Se at 4 and 16 μmol L−1, prompted a relief of this stress, reducing both lipid peroxidation and the sugar content, and increasing the nitrate concentration. In addition, in the case of the highest concentration of Se (16 μmol L−1), the values of nitrate were comparable those control plants. We show the importance of sprayed Se in increasing the efficiency of N utilization, in addition to lessening environmental issues for aquaponics culture. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
