#ITI#Methane and nitrous oxide emissions from rice paddy soil as influenced by timing of application of hydroquinone and dicyandiamide#FTI#
#IRE#A pot trial and a field experiment were conducted to study the effect of timing of application of nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) on N 2O and CH 4 emissions from rice paddy soil. Four treatments including Treatment CK 1, DCD-1 (application of DCD with basal fertilizer), DCD-2 (DCD with tillering fertilizer) and DCD-3 (DCD with panicle initiation fertilizer), were designed and implemented in pot experiment. Total N 2O and CH 4 emissions from DCD-treated soils were decreased profoundly when compared with that from urea alone (P < 0.05). Application of DCD together with basal fertilizer, tillering fertilizer and panicle initiation fertilizer reduced N 2O emission by 8, 30 and 2%, respectively, while those for CH 4 were 21, 8 and 1%. The field experiment with four treatments was carried out subsequently, and a kind of urease inhibitor hydroquinone (HQ) was also incorporated with DCD simultaneously. The combined use of HQ and DCD with basal fertilizer, tillering fertilizer and panicle initiation fertilizer decreased N 2O emissions by 24, 56 and 17%, respectively, while those for CH 4 were 35, 19 and 12%. N 2O emission was effectively reduced by the inhibitor(s) applied with tillering fertilizer before midseason aeration, while CH 4 emission was effectively decreased by the combined use of inhibitor(s) with basal fertilizer before rice transplanting. Furthermore, an increase in rice yield and a reduction of total global warming potential (GWP) of CH 4 and N 2O could be achieved by using inhibitor(s) in rice paddy field.
