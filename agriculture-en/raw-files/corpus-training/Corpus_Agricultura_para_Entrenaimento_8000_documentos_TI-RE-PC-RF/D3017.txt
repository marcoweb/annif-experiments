#ITI#Seed quality behavior of soybean (Glycine max) as influenced by different packaging materials and storage conditions#FTI#
#IRE#A Study was carried out to find out the seed quality behavior of soybean (Glycine max) as influenced by different packaging materials and storage conditions. Soybean seeds were stored in different packaging materials viz., gunny bags, high density polythene bags and vacuum packed bags stored at room temperature (25 ± 2° C) and cold storage (4 ± 1° C) for a period of 18 months. The treatments having six combinations and consisting of different containers viz., gunny bags, high density polythene bags and vacuum packed bags were replicated four times in both cold and ambient storage conditions in completely randomized design. The results of the study revealed that the that the seeds stored in vacuum packed bags maintained the seed quality with least deterioration with respect to all the seed quality parameters compared to seeds stored in gunny bags and high density polythene bags. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
