#ITI#Aphid migrant activity in refuge habitats of the Wielkopolska agricultural landscape#FTI#
#IRE#Refuge habitats have a stabilising effect on the entomofauna in the agricultural landscape. The objective of this research was to follow the migrant activity of aphids in two types of refuge habitats: shrubs and roadsides of rural areas. Moericke traps method were used for testing the seasonal activity of aphids. The dynamics of species numbers were assessed, and the phenology of the dominating taxa was examined. From 2008 to 2010, more than 5,000 winged aphids from 94 species were caught in shrub habitats, and 83 species were caught in rural roadside habitats. The characteristics of aphid groups were defined on the basis of selected indicators. Annually, in both locations, flight activity was shown by a group of several taxa. The rank position of the species was varied in the particular sites and years of the research. Species participation differed when analysing aphid flights, so the seasons were divided into three separate periods: spring, summer, and autumn.#FRE#
