#ITI#Measurement and modeling of nitrous and nitric oxide emissions from a tea field in subtropical central China#FTI#
#IRE#Tea fields represent an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions due to high nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications and very low soil pH. To investigate the temporal characteristics of N2O and NO emissions, daily emissions were measured over 2½ years period using static closed-chamber/gas chromatograph and chemiluminescent measurement system in a tea field of subtropical central China. Our results revealed that N2O and NO fluxes showed similar temporal trends, which were generally driven by temporal variations in soil temperature and soil moisture content and were also affected by fertilization events. The measured average annual N2O and NO emissions were 10.9 and 3.3 kg N ha−1 year−1, respectively, highlighting the high N2O and NO emissions from tea fields. To improve our understanding of N-cycling processes in tea ecosystems, we developed a new nitrogenous gas emission module for the water and nitrogen management model (WNMM, V2) that simulated daily N2O and NO fluxes, in which the NO was simulated as being emitted from both nitrification and nitrite chemical decomposition. The results demonstrated that the WNMM captured the general temporal dynamics of N2O (NSE = 0.40; R2 = 0.52, RMSE = 0.03 kg N ha−1 day−1, P < 0.001) and NO (NSE = 0.41; R2 = 0.44, RMSE = 0.01 kg N ha−1 day−1, P < 0.001) emissions. According to the simulation, denitrification was identified as the dominant process contributing 76.5% of the total N2O emissions, while nitrification and nitrite chemical decomposition accounted for 52.3 and 47.7% of the total NO emissions, respectively. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
