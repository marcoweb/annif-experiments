#ITI#Three-dimensional dynamics of nitrogen from banded enhanced efficiency fertilizers#FTI#
#IRE#A range of enhanced efficiency fertilizers (EEFs) have been developed in response to widespread recognition of poor nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) in agriculture; however, their effective utilization is not properly understood when applied in sub-surface bands. This study quantified soil chemical changes and the distribution of N species that arose from sub-surface banding of urea, a controlled release polymer-coated urea (PCU) and urea coated with either nitrification inhibitors (NIs) or a urease inhibitor (UI), over 71 days in a field trial. Banding NIs extended the duration of nitrification inhibition for up to 50 days longer than banded urea, although the duration of NI-conferred inhibition was dependant on the rate of NI-urea application. The UI preserved urea-N at a concentration which was 16-fold higher cf. standard urea over 7 days, but no urea-N was detected after 21 days. This suggests that the NUE benefits of UIs are transient when applied in sub-surface bands. Slow release of urea-N from banded PCU resulted in lower concentrations of N in the soil solution. This reduced N dispersal by ca. 50 mm cf. urea, resulting in a N-enriched zone which was considerably smaller. Relatively benign chemical conditions around PCU bands enabled rates of nitrification (NH4–N:NO3–N ratio of 46%) which were similar to urea. Collectively, these results demonstrate the relative efficacy and risks of the different EEF technologies, when applied in fertilizer bands. This knowledge supports the effective utilization of band-applied EEFs for improved NUE in agricultural systems. © 2020, The Author(s).#FRE#
