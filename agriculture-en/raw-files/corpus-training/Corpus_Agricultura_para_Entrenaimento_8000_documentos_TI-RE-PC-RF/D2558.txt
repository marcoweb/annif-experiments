#ITI#Biochemical basis of resistance in chickpea varieties against Callosobruchus chinensis Linn. (Coleoptera: Bruchidae)#FTI#
#IRE#Eleven chickpea varieties were screened for their biochemical resistance to the pulse beetle (Callosobruchus chinensis L.), a serious pest of the stored pulses. The varieties were found to arrest the growth and development of C. chinensis, at grub stages which were indicated by different parameters viz., oviposition, adult emergence, weight loss, developmental period and growth index. Among the various biochemical analyzed, high growth index was observed in the varieties PKG 2 (0.61), BG 1003 (0.62), BG 1053 (0.62) and PKG 1 (0.71). Low growth index recorded in PG 3 (0.52), BGM 547 and PG 186 (0.56) may be attributed to low phenol and tannin content. Similarly the varieties PKG 1, BG 1003 and BG 1053 with less phenol, flavonoids and tannin content recorded more growth index as compared to moderate resistance varieties PG 4, PBG 1 and PG 114 PBG 1, BGM 547 and PG 114 were found to be moderately resistant and PKG 1, PKG 2, BG 1053 and BG 1003 as highly susceptible, shows the major role of trypsin inhibitor in protein resistance to C. chinensis. The highest protease activity inhibition acts as antimetabolites to C. chinensis, inhibit to the feeding of grubs as result higher trypsin content varieties showed relative resistance. The correlation between different antinutritional factors and growth index of the grub also showed a negative relationship. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
