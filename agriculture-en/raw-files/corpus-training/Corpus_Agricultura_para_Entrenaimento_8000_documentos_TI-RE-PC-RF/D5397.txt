#IRE#The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Program makes annual recommendations on influenza vaccine formulation and related activities. This results in 230 million annual doses of vaccine produced for human use. The success of this program is based on the collection and genetic and antigenic analyses of influenza viruses collected by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Program. New programs focus on pandemic preparedness and include development and distribution of testing reagents for emerging or potentially emerging human influenza viruses. WHO Animal Influenza Network focuses on aspects of ecology and molecular biology of animal influenza viruses in the context of human health.#FRE#
