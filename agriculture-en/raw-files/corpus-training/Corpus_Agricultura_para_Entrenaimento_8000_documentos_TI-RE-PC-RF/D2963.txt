#ITI#Participatory varietal selection among elite cowpea genotypes in northern Namibia#FTI#
#IRE#The objective of this study was to select cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.] varieties that meet farmers’ needs in Namibia, from a set of newly developed and elite cowpea varieties developed through gamma irradiation. Thirty four candidate mutant cowpea varieties derived from three local varieties, (Shindimba, Bira and Nakare), were evaluated for nine agronomic traits. The new genotypes descended from Bira were favourably selected by all participants for their best plant cover. The genotype L1P12 (Bi450) was preferred by 81 percent percent of farmers for its higher pod setting ability. The genotype R4P5 (Nk150) with longer pod size and R3P1 (Bi600) with early maturity were ideal candidates preferred by nearly all farmers. The present study has identified farmers’ most-preferred cowpea varieties selected for their best agronomic performances and drought tolerance. These selected cowpea genotype lines will further be subjected to distinct, uniformity and stability trials for varietal registration and release. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
