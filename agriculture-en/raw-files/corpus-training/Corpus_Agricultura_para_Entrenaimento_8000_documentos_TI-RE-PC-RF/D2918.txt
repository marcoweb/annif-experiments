#ITI#Quantitative detection of aflatoxin and species identification of aspergillus section flavi isolates from peanuts using molecular approaches#FTI#
#IRE#Totally, 50 Aspergillus section Flavi were identified isolates having aflatoxin biosynthesis genes on peanut by molecular method and aflatoxin production. Primer pair (IGS-F/R) recognized the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene (aflJ-aflR) targeting the intergenic region (IGS) on DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The PCR product were restricted by BglII enzyme within Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and obtained from 33 (66%) Aspergillus flavus was cleaved into three band sizes of 362, 210 and 102 bp. However, BglII enzyme generated two band sizes of 363 and 311 bp for 17 (34%) Aspergillus parasiticus. An investigation examined DNA sequence data to characterize these isolates and describe the species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that A. flavus and A. parasiticus have been identified in different groups. All the A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates produced aflatoxins. The present study provides a new method on molecular characterization of A. section Flavi in Turkey. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
