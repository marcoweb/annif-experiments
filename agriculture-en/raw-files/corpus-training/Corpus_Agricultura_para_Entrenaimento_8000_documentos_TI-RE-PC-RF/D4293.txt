#ITI#Type C botulism in a commercial Turkey farm: A case report#FTI#
#IRE#Botulism is an intoxication caused by exotoxins of Clostridium botulinum. The case of botulism described here occurred on a commercial meat turkey farm with two houses. Toms and hens were maintained in two separate houses, toms in house A and hens in house B. At 10 wk of age, an increase in mortality was observed in the toms located in house A. Clinically the animals presented with paralysis of the legs, wings, and neck. Affected birds were sitting and reluctant to move. Necropsy failed to find any specific lesions. In liver, heart, muscles, crop, and gizzard as well as in intestinal contents, DNA of C. botulinum type C was detected by PCR. The result was confirmed by a mouse lethality neutralization test. During the 2 wk after the onset of the clinical signs the mortality was about 12%. The hens kept in house B did not show any symptoms and remained healthy. Investigations of environmental samples to detect the source of the toxin were not successful. After 2 wk clinical signs and mortality abated. At 16 wk of age, toms again showed the same clinical signs accompanied by raised mortality. Again C. botulinum toxin type C was detected. Within 2 wk the total mortality reached roughly 50%. Based on the "precautionary principle" and in agreement with the local authorities, the birds were euthanatized using CO2 in order to not compromise food safety. © American Association of Avian Pathologists 2012.#FRE#
