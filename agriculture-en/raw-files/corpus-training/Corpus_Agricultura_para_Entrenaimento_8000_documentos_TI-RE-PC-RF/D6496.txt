#ITI#High temperature can improve the performance of invasive plants by facilitating root growth#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: The ever-increasing temperatures of the Anthropocene may facilitate plant invasions. To date, studies of temperature effects on alien plants have mainly focused on aboveground plant traits but ignored belowground traits, which may confound predictions of plant invasion risks. Methods: The temperature effects on the root growth dynamics of two alien shrubs, invasive Mimosa sepiaria and naturalized Corchorus capsulari, were studied using a 3D, transparent growth system under five temperature treatments (day/night: 18°C/13°C to 34°C/29°C) that cover the present and future warming temperature scenarios in China. We measured root depth and width growth in response to temperature treatments over 84 days. We also investigated intra- and interspecific competition of paired plants of the two species grown together at the five temperatures. Results: Shoot growth of M. sepiaria and C. capsularis was optimal at the mid-range temperature. Root growth, however, was faster at the highest temperature (34°C/29°C) for M. sepiaria, but decreased for C. capsularis as temperatures increased. Root depth growth was more sensitive than root width for both species during neighbor competition. Compared to C. capsularis, M. sepiaria had relatively greater advantage during intra- and interspecific competition with increasing temperature, possibly because of its better root growth at high temperatures. Conclusions: These results suggest that temperature increases can improve the performance of some alien plants by facilitating width and depth growth of their roots. This enhancement requires serious attention when managing and predicting invasion risk. © 2023 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
