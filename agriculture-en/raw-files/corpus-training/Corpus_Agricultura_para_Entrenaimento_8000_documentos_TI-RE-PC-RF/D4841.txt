#ITI#Poxvirus infection in a great tit (Parus major)#FTI#
#IRE#Four great tits (Parus major) with nodular lesions suggestive of poxvirus infections were observed in a garden in Vienna, Austria. One of the birds was submitted for examination. Because of its poor condition, the bird had to be euthanatized and was subsequently necropsied. An avipoxvirus infection was confirmed by histopathology, electron microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. This is the second report of naturally occurring poxvirus infection in great tits and the first of its kind in central Europe.#FRE#
