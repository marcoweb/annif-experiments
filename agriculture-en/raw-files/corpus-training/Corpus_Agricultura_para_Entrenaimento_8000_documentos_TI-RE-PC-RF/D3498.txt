#ITI#Identifying mycelial compatibility groups of sclerotinia sclerotiorum using potato dextrose agar amended with activated charcoal#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, mycelial compatibility grouping (MCG) of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary was determined in 15 infected potato fields in Bahar and Lelehjin, Hamadan, Iran. Among 193 isolates, 37 MCGs were identified and 67% were represented by single isolates observed at single locations. Within Bahar fields, 29 MCGs were identified and 15 MCGs were recognized in Lalehjin samples. MCGs 2, 6, 18 and 25 were collected at high frequency from multiple locations. The efficacy of Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) amended with activated charcoal for identifying MCGs in this fungus was tested in doubtful reactions and proved to be an effective medium. The activated charcoal produced a black reaction area in incompatible interactions as well as a red reaction line in PDA amended with McCormick's red food coloring.#FRE#
