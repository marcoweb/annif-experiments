#ITI#Toxicity of essential oil of Agastache foeniculum (Pursh) Kuntze to Oryzaephilus surinamensis L. and Lasioderma serricorne F.#FTI#
#IRE#The essential oil of aerial parts of Agastache foeniculum (Lamiaceae) was isolated by hydrodistillation method and constituents of oil were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method. Methyl chavicol, 1,8-cineole, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-octanone and germacrene D the predominant components of oil. Methyl chavicol (94.003%) was identified as a major component in the oil. Essential oil was tested for toxicity against adults of Oryzaephilus surinamensis L. and Lasioderma serricorne F. The influence of different concentrations of the essential oil vapours on adult mortality was significant. Data of probit analysis showed that a lethal concentration of the essential oil to kill 50% of the population (LC50) for adults of O. surinamensis and L. serricorne were 18.781 and 21.565 Î¼l/l respectively. O. surinamensis was more susceptible than L. serricorne at the exposure time 24 h. The results demonstrated that mortality increased with the increase in concentration and exposure time. These results showed that the essential oil from A. foeniculum could be applicable the management of population of stored-product beetle pest.#FRE#
