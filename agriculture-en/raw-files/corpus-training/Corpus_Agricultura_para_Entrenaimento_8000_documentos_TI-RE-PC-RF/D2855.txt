#ITI#Effect of phosphorus and sulphur application on performance of vegetable pea (Pisum sativum L.) cv. Pant Matar-2#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during the winter season of 2009-10 to find out the optimum dose of phosphorus and sulphur on growth, nodulation, yield attributes and yield of garden pea (Pisum sativum L.). Four levels of P2O5 (0, 20, 40 and 60 kg/ha) and three levels of sulphur (0, 20 and 40 kg/ha), were applied through single super phosphate and gypsum, respectively. Treatments were replicated three times in factorial randomized block design. Application of phosphorus and sulphur resulted in an increase in various growth characters, nodulation, yield attributing traits and yield of garden pea. The application of 60 kg P2O5 produced the highest mature green pod yield (73.83 q/ha). Similarly the levels of sulphur up to 40 kg/ha showed linear increased in growth, nodulation and yield of garden pea. The application of 40 kg sulphur produced the highest yield of 66.51 q/ha.#FRE#
