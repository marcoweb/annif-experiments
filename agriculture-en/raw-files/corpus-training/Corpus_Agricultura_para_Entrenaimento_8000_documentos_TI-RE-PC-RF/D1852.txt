#ITI#Greenhouse gas intensity and net ecosystem carbon budget following the application of green manures in rice paddies#FTI#
#IRE#Green manure application has been a good fertility management for crop growth and soil quality, but its effect on greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) and net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB) of rice ecosystem is not well understood. Two green manure species, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and broad beans (Vicia faba L.), and two N fertilization levels (0 and 200 kg ha−1), alone or in combination, were applied to rice paddy soils in 2012 and 2013. The results show that the grain yields increased by 25.36, 29.81, and 41.85 % for the N fertilizer, N + broad bean, and N + alfalfa treatments, respectively, compared with the no fertilizer. CH4 and N2O emissions increased by 50.77 and 36.11 %, 30.70 and 75.04 % in N + broad bean and N + alfalfa treatments, respectively, compared to N fertilizer treatment. The average CH4 and N2O emissions were 37.47 and 63.22 % higher in 2013 than in 2012, respectively, whereas the average soil temperature during the rice growth period was 2.1 °C higher in 2013 than in 2012. The highest value in GHGI was associated with the N + broad bean treatment (with a high C/N ratio), while the NECB and mass of soil total carbon change (MSTC) were highest in the N + alfalfa treatment (with a low C/N ratio). This result indicates that high C/N ratio green manures had high grain yields yet increased GHGI, while low C/N ratio green manures had even higher grains yields with increased NECB and MSTC. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
