#ITI#Overexpression of phosphatidylserine synthase IbPSS1 enhances salt tolerance by stimulating ethylene signaling-dependent lignin synthesis in sweetpotato roots#FTI#
#IRE#Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an important lipid signaling required for plant growth regulation and salt stress adaptation. However, how PS positively regulate plant salt tolerance is still largely unknown. In this study, IbPSS1-overexpressed sweetpotato plants that exhibited overproduction of PS was employed to explore the mechanisms underlying the PS stimulation of plant salt tolerance. The results revealed that the IbPSS1-overexpressed sweetpotato accumulated less Na+ in the stem and leaf tissues compared with the wild type plants. Proteomic profile of roots showed that lignin synthesis-related proteins over-accumulated in IbPSS1-overexpressed sweetpotato. Correspondingly, the lignin content was enhanced but the influx of Na + into the stele was significantly blocked in IbPSS1-overexpressed sweetpotato. The results further revealed that ethylene synthesis and signaling related genes were upregulated in IbPSS1-overexpressed sweetpotato. Ethylene imaging experiment revealed the enhancement of ethylene mainly localized in the root stele. Inhibition of ethylene synthesis completely reversed the PS-overproduction induced lignin synthesis and Na+ influx pattern in stele tissues. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a mechanism by which PS regulates ethylene signaling and lignin synthesis in the root stele, thus helping sweetpotato plants to block the loading of Na+ into the xylem and to minimize the accumulation of Na+ in the shoots. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
