#ITI#Pathogenicity, transmissibility, and tissue distribution of avian pneumovirus in turkey poults#FTI#
#IRE#The pathogenicity, transmissibility, tissue distribution, and persistence of avian pneumovirus (APV) in turkey poults were investigated in three experiments. In the first experiment, we inoculated 2-wk-old commercial turkey poults oculonasally with APV alone or in combination with Bordetella avium. In the dually infected group, clinical signs were more severe, the virus persisted longer, the bacteria invaded more respiratory tissues, and the birds had higher antibody titer than the group exposed to APV or B. avium alone. In the second experiment, we studied the distribution of APV in different tissues in experimentally inoculated 2-wk-old commercial turkey poults. Only samples from sinuses, tracheas, and lungs were positive for APV by both reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction and virus isolation. In the third experiment, we studied the ability of APV to spread among birds in 1-wk-old commercial turkey poults inoculated oculonasally. The virus was isolated and the viral RNA was detected in the inoculated and direct contact birds. The virus was not isolated, viral RNA was not detected, and no antibodies were detected in the indirect contact birds. These birds were placed in different cages in the same room where the airflow was directed from the infected toward the uninfected indirect contact group.#FRE#
