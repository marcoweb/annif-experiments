#ITI#Do Silene species with exposed stigmas tolerate interference by heterospecific pollen?#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Co-flowering species that have not evolved an avoidance mechanism may have tolerance to heterospecific pollen (HP) deposition as an adaptive strategy to minimize any deleterious effects of HP transfer, but empirical evidence for the tolerance hypothesis remains scarce. Methods: To estimate the potential effects of heterospecific pollen deposition (HPD) on female reproductive success, we counted conspecific (CP) and HP pollen grains deposited on stigmas and assessed subsequent seed set of both open- and hand-pollinated flowers in three co-flowering Silene species with exposed stigmas that usually received numerous HP grains on the elongated receptive area. Results: The percentage of HP grains per flower (HP%) varied from 16.6% to 43.0% among three species. Silene chungtienensis had lower HP%, and the CP-HP relationship was neutral; S. gracilicaulis and S. yunnanensis had a relatively higher HP% with a positive CP-HP relationship. The effects of CP and HP number on natural seed set were positive for all three species, but HP% had stronger negative effects in S. chungtienensis and S. gracilicaulis. In hand-pollinated flowers of the three Silene species, seed set did not decrease with HP whether CP was in excess or insufficient, indicating no negative effects of HPD on seed production. Conclusions: Consistent with the tolerance hypothesis, our results indicated that species with higher HP interference are likely to be tolerant to an increase in HP%. These species with generalist-pollinated flowers and exposed large stigmas may benefit from an increase of conspecific pollen deposition, despite the associated increase in heterospecific pollen deposition.
