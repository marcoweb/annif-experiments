#ITI#Screening of dolichos bean [Lablab purpureus (L.) sweet] genotypes for aluminium tolerance#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation was carried out to screen the dolichos bean genotypes for aluminium tolerance. The experiment was laid out in a factorial completely randomized design with 2 factors (20 genotypes with four aluminium concentration of 0, 15, 30, 45 mg of Al/kg soil) with three replications. Main effect and interaction effects were studied for vine length, root length, root tolerance index, root dry matter, shoot dry matter, leaf dry matter, total dry matter and extractable aluminium in soil at 4th week after sowing whereas the pod weight, pod length and yield were observed at harvesting stage. The genotypes and aluminium treatment showed significant difference for all the studied parameters. The interaction effect was also found to be significant for all the characters except for vine length. From the present study it was concluded that genotypes Pusa Sem 3, G2 and G4 were tolerant to aluminium toxicity upto 45 mg Al/kg as well as high yielding. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
