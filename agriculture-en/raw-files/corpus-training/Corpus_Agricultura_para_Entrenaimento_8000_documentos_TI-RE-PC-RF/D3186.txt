#ITI#Studies on genetic variability, character association and path analysis for yield and its contributing traits in chickpea[Cicer arietinum (L.)]#FTI#
#IRE#Genetic parameters, variability, heritability and genetic advance were studied among 20 genotypes of chickpea during during rabi 2012-13. The characters, seed yield per plant and 100-seed weight had high values of GCV, heritability and GAM and were found to be under greater control of additive gene action. While the traits, primary branches per plant, number of seeds per pod and protein content with moderate to low heritability coupled with low genetic advance appear to be more affected by on non-additive gene action. Correlation and path coefficient analysis for seed yield per plant and its components indicated that out of 11 characters, seed yield per plant showed significant and positive correlation with harvest index, number of seeds per pod, primary branches per plant, number of pods per plant, biomass per plant, and 100-seed weight indicating that an intense selection for these characters will improve seed yield in chickpea. Path coefficient analysis revealed that days to maturity, primary branches per plant, biomass per plant, harvest index, protein content and number of seeds per pod were major characters influencing seed yield directly and indirectly. The results indicated that number of seeds per pod should be given greater emphasis for manipulation of seed yield in chickpea. Â© 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
