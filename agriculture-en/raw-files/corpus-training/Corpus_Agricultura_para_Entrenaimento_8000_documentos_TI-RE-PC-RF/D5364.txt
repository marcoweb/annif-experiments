#ITI#Safety evaluation in chickens of candidate human vaccines against potential pandemic strains of influenza#FTI#
#IRE#Two candidate formalin-inactivated vaccines, made from high-growth reassortant viruses with the HA and NA genes from avian viruses in a background of genes derived from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8), were prepared against H5N1 and H9N2 subtypes (designated as H5N1/PR8 and H9N2/PR8, respectively). These viruses bear the genotypes, antigenicity, and attenuation in mouse models that are desirable in candidate vaccines. The pathogenicity of the newly generated avian-human reassortant vaccine viruses was also evaluated in chickens. Neither H5N1/PR8 nor H9N2/PR8 were highly pathogenic for chickens. No clinical signs, gross legions, or histological lesions were observed in chickens that were administered H5N1/PR8 either intranasally (i.n.) or intravenously (i.v.), and virus was not detected in oropharyngeal or doacal swabs. When H9N2/PR8 was administered i.n., no clinical signs, gross lesions, or histological lesions were observed and no virus was detected in cloacal swabs. However, virus was isolated at low titer from oropharyngeal swabs of all eight chickens. Although no clinical signs were observed when H9N2/PR8 was administered i.v., mild tracheitis was seen in one of two chickens. Moderate amounts of antigen were observed in tracheal respiratory epithelium, and low titers of virus were recovered from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs of some chickens. In summary, both reassortant vaccine viruses replicated poorly in chickens. These studies suggest that these candidate vaccine viruses carry a low risk of transmission to chickens.#FRE#
