#ITI#Photosynthetic opportunity cost and energetic cost of a rapid leaf closure behavior in Mimosa pudica#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the Study: The rapid leaf movement of Mimosa pudica is expected to be costly because of energetic trade-offs with other processes such as growth and reproduction. Here, we assess the photosynthetic opportunity cost and energetic cost of the unique leaf closing behavior of M. pudica. Methods: In the greenhouse, we employed novel touch-stimulation machines to expose plants to one of three treatments: (1) untouched control plants; (2) plants touch-stimulated to close their leaves during the day to incur energetic costs associated with leaf movement and reduced photosynthesis; (3) plants touched at night to assess the effects of touch alone. M. pudica is nyctinastic and closes its leaves at night; thus, touching at night does not impart additional costs. We directly assessed costs by comparing physical traits. Leaf re-opening response was measured to assess the potential for plant behavioral plasticity to impact photosynthetic opportunity costs. Key Results: The cost of rapid leaf closure behavior was expressed as a 47% reduction in reproductive biomass accounting for the effect of touch. Touch itself changed physical traits such as biomass, with touched plants being generally bigger. Plants touched at night re-opened their leaflets 26% quicker than plants touched during the day. Conclusions: We reason that the reproductive allocation costs incurred by M. pudica can be attributed to a combination of photosynthetic opportunity cost and the energetic cost associated with increased stimulation of leaf movement and that behavioral plasticity has the potential to alter photosynthetic opportunity costs. © 2018 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
