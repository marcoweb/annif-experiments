#ITI#‘Tifway’ bermudagrass recovery after drought periods of different durations under shallow sandy soil in a Mediterranean climate#FTI#
#IRE#Water management constitutes one of the main challenges for turfgrass growing in arid and semi-arid regions, exacerbated when the conditions under which the turfgrass is cultivated are limiting (e.g., sandy shallow soils with low maintenance). The objective of this study has been to evaluate the recovery of Tifway [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. × Cynodon transvaalensis (Burtt-Davy)] bermudagrass when grown on a 10-cm sandy soil rootzone and under low-maintenance management (i.e., reduced fertilization) after varying periods of summer drought. Turfgrass assessment was performed by monitoring the green coverage and quality attributes during the recovery period. The duration of the drought was found to be determinant for the recovery capacity of Tifway bermudagrass. Summer drought periods longer than 5 weeks did not allow reaching at least 50% of the green coverage. The soil depth and type were shown to be limiting factors of the recovery capacity from drought of Tifway bermudagrass, as can be seen from a comparison with other data found in the literature for the same species/cultivar. The data collected in order to monitor the performance of the turfgrass (green cover and visual quality) using Digital Image Analysis and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were very similar to those obtained by traditional observation methods, reducing labor hours. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
