#ITI#Genetic variability for growth, pod and quality attributes in germplasm of cluster bean [cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) taub.]#FTI#
#IRE#An investigation on variability for yield and yield attributes was carried out in 51 cluster bean genotypes at College of Horticulture, Rajendra nagar, Sri Konda Laxman Telangana State Horticultural University, Hyderabad during summer 2017. All the sixteen characters studied had shown highly significant (at P=0.01) difference. The characters, viz., plant height, number of branches per plant, number of clusters per plant, number of pods per cluster, number of pods per plant, pod length, pod girth, pod weight, number of seeds per pod, pod yield per plant, pod yield per hectare, protein content, gum content and fibre content recorded high estimates of genotypic and phenotypic coefficients of variation, high heritability along with high genetic advance over mean indicating selection would be very effective for improvement of these characters.
