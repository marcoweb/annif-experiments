#ITI#Comparison of greenhouse and 32P isotopic laboratory methods for evaluating the agronomic effectiveness of natural and modified rock phosphates in some acid soils of Ghana#FTI#
#IRE#Phosphorus deficiency is one of the major constraints for normal plant growth and crop yields in the acid soils of Ghana and therefore addition of P inputs is required for sustainable crop production. This is often difficult, if not impossible for small-scale farmers due to the high cost of mineral P fertilizers and limited access to fertilizer supplies. Direct application of finely ground phosphate rocks (PRs) and their modified forms have been recommended as alternatives for P fertilization. The direct application of the natural and modified PRs to these acid soils implies the need to predict their agronomic effectiveness of the PRs in the simplest and most cost-effective manner. In this study the classical greenhouse pot experiment was compared to the 32P isotopic kinetics laboratory method for evaluating the agronomic effectiveness of natural and modified Togo PR in six highly weathered Oxisols from southwest Ghana. In the 32P isotopic kinetics laboratory experiment the six soil samples were each fertilised at the rate of 50 mg P kg-1 soil in the form of triple superphosphate (TSP), Togo PAPR-50%, and Togo PR, respectively. Controls without P amendment were also included. Isotopic exchange kinetics experiments were carried out on two sets of samples, immediately after P fertilizer additions (without incubation) and after 6 weeks of incubation under wet conditions and at a room temperature of 25 Â°C. In the greenhouse pot experiment, P fertilizers in the form of Togo PR, Togo PAPR, Mali PR and TSP were each applied to the six soils at rates equivalent to 0, 30, 60, and 120 kg P ha-1, respectively. The P fertilizers were mixed with the soils and maize (Zea mays L.) variety Obatanpa was grown for 42 days before harvest. The isotopic kinetics data of the control samples indicated that 5 of the studied soils had very low P fertility status as reflected by their low P concentrations in solution (CP<0.02 mg P 1-1) and low exchangeable P (E1min < 5 mg P kg-1). The capacity factor and the fixation index of the soils were variable. Application of water-soluble P as TSP increased both the CP and E1 values of all the soils above the critical levels. Togo PR was least effective among the fertilizers tested for all soil soils, except in Boi soil. Acidulation of Togo PR (Togo PAPR-50%) was an effective means to increase its agronomic effectiveness. Direct application of natural Togo PR would be only feasible in the Boi soil series as reflected by its high Pdff% value in soil solution. Incubation with the P fertilizers caused an increase in the soil pH and a decline in the effectiveness of the applied P fertilizers, irrespective of the soil and the fertilizer utilized. Based upon the results of the greenhouse pot experiment, the relative crop response index (RCRI) in terms of increasing dry matter yield and P uptake followed the order of TSP > PAPR = Mali PR >Togo PR = Control. Both the laboratory index, Pdff% in soil solution derived from the isotopic method and the RCRI values obtained from the pot experiment produced similar results in ranking the P fertilizers tested according to their agronomic effectiveness. The isotopic kinetic method may be considered as an alternative to both greenhouse and field methods in the evaluation of agronomic effectiveness of P fertilizers in tropical acid soils when it offers comparative advantages in assessing the soil P status and its changes. But trained staff and adequate laboratory facilities are needed to perform this technique. Also the method can be used as a reference for comparison purposes as in this case. Further research is needed to assess the overall agronomic effectiveness (immediate and residual effects) of PR sources in predominant cropping systems of this region of Ghana.#FRE#
