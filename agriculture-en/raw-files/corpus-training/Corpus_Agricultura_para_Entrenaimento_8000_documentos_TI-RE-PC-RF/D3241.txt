#ITI#Effect of organic sources of nutrients, humic acid and sea weed extracts on growth and yield of french bean varieties#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was conducted during the rabi season of 2016-17 and 2017-18 to study the effect of various organic nutrient sources on French bean varieties. Experimental findings revealed that the addition of bio stimulants and vermicompost increased the yield and quality of the fresh pods however flowering and days to first harvesting were delayed. Regarding the combination of organic nutrient sources, O6 (Vermicompost + Rhizobium + PSB + Sea weed extract) resulted in better growth attributes viz., plant height, number of primary branches and dry weight of the nodules. Yield attributes like pod length and pod width were maximum in O2 (Vermicompost + Rhizobium + PSB) while regarding the number of pods per plant, yield per plant and yield per ha, O5 (Vermicompost + Rhizobium + PSB + Humic acid) were superior. Among the three varieties, the performance of Victoria (V1 ) was preeminent. Eventually considering the yield (79.3 g/plant) and BCR (2.7), Victoria along with the combination of FYM + Rhizobium + PSB + Sea weed extract might be suitable for the terai region of West Bengal.
