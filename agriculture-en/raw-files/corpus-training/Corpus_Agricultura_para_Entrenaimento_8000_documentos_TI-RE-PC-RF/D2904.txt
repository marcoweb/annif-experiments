#ITI#Characterization and identification of pigeonpea [cajanus cajan (L.) millsp.] genotypes based on quality of seed protein#FTI#
#IRE#Tris-and water-soluble seed protein profiling was used to characterize, identify and differentiate 13 genotypes of pigeonpea via SDS– PAGE based electrophoresis of seed protein. Electropherograms, RM-value and UPGMA based cluster (dendrograms) analysis was used to analyze tris-and water-soluble protein banding patterns of these genotypes. It revealed that RM-value of protein bands have differed from all the genotypes for both soluble proteins. Tris-soluble protein banding pattern exhibited 17 bands including 12-15 variate of RM-value (0.083 to 0.98) and two common bands with RM-value 0.083 and 0.78. However, water-soluble protein banding pattern revealed the presence of 16 bands including 8-12 variate of RM-value (0.16 to 0.95) with four common bands of RM-value 0.43, 048, 0.23 and 0.65, respectively. UPGMA cluster analysis was used to group the 13 genotypes into six distinct clusters. The banding pattern of tris-soluble protein was found to be more distinct than water-soluble protein. The result demonstrated that the electrophoretic profile of tris-soluble protein through SDS-PAGE was more effective than the water-soluble protein. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
