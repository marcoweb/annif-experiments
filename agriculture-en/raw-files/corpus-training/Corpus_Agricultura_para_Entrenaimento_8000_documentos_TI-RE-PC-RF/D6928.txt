#ITI#Suitability of trunk diameter reference lines for irrigation scheduling with saline water in late mandarin trees with different crop load#FTI#
#IRE#A two year experiment on Fortune mandarin trees (Clementina×mandarina Dancy (Citrus clementina Hort. Ex. Tanaka×Citrus reticulata Blanco)) grafted onto Cleopatra mandarin (Citrus reshni Hort. ex. Tanaka) rootstock was carried out with the aim of studying the suitability of midday stem water potential (ψ stem) and trunk diameter reference baselines for irrigation scheduling. Plants were drip-irrigated with saline water during the second year (EC 25°C≈4dSm -1). Measurements of ψ stem, trunk daily growth rate (TGR) and maximum daily trunk shrinkage (MDS) were related with meteorological variables. Among them, MDS presented the best behavior. The mean temperature during the period 10.00-15.00h solar time (T md) was the environmental variable that best correlated with MDS, although there were no differences with other T-related variables (daily mean and daily maximum values). MDS data from stage III did not correlate with meteorological variables and fit-linear regressions became better with data from stages I and II (March-October), this being the period which covers 80% of total crop water requirements. Despite the different conditions that the trees were submitted to during the experimental period, i.e. irrigation water with different salinity and crop load, inter-annual differences were not observed in the reference baselines obtained. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..#FRE#
