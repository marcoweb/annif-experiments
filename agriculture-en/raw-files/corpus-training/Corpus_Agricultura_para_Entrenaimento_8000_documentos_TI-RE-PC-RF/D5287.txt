#ITI#The effect of killed salmonella enteritidis vaccine prior to induced molting on the shedding of S. enteritidis in laying hens#FTI#
#IRE#Effects of administering killed Salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (SE) vaccines to laying hens prior to induced molting on egg production and on shedding of SE were investigated. Forty hens were vaccinated with one of two SE vaccines available commercially in the United States and Japan. Twenty-five days after vaccination, feed was withdrawn for 2 wk from 20 vaccinated plus 10 unvaccinated hens to induce molt. Four days after molt induction, all hens were challenged with a dose of 2.4 Ã— 109 of SE. For the 25 days following administration of the SE bacterins, egg production in vaccinated hens showed approximately a 15% decrease. After molt induction, egg production in molted hens ceased and then returned to normal levels 8 or 9 wk postvaccination. Through the 3-mo experimental period, the decreases in numbers of eggs laid in the unvaccinated/molted group and two vaccinated/molted groups were 225 (26.2%), 245 (28.4%), and 274 (31.9%), respectively, compared with 860 in the unvaccinated/unmolted group. There was no significant difference in egg lay at the P < 0.05 level among the former three groups. Hens in the vaccinated/molted groups shed about two logs less SE than hens in the unvaccinated/molted group 3-14 days postchallenge (P < 0.05 or 0.01). These results indicate that vaccination prior to induced molting might be effective in preventing the exacerbation of SE problems within flocks in which the potential for SE contamination may exist.#FRE#
