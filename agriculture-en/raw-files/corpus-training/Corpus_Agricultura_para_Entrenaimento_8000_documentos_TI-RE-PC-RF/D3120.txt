#ITI#Genetic divergence, correlation and path coefficient analysis for the yield components of pigeonpea genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation was carried out using thirty two pigeonpea genotypes during kharif 2013-14 to obtain the knowledge of correlation, path coefficient analysis for the yield components and genetic divergence. The range of GCV was observed from 9.81 to 40.88% for the traits under study which provides information regarding the extent of variability present among the genotypes. Seed yield was significantly and positively correlated with number of secondary branches/plant, pods/plant and 100-seed weight. Path coefficient analysis indicated that number of secondary branches exhibited maximum direct effect followed by number of pods/plant and 100 seed weight. The genotypes were grouped into eight different clusters based on Mahalonobis D2 statistics. Clusters II and III exhibited maximum inter cluster distance of 8.80. Days to 50% flowering contributed to maximum genetic divergence followed by seed yield. Genotypes in cluster III recorded highest mean value for days to maturity, number of secondary branches and seed yield. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
