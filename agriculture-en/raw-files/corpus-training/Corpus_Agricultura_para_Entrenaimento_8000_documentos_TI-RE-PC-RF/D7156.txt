#ITI#Spatial distribution of soil hydro-physical properties and morphometric analysis of a rainfed watershed as a tool for sustainable land use planning#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, high resolution (5.8 m) multi-spectral satellite data (IRS-P6, LISS IV) along with extensive ground information were used for sustainable land use planning of a rainfed watershed in eastern India (Bahasuni watershed, Dhenkanal, Orissa). Pedo-transfer functions were developed to predict soil water constants using easily measured parameters such as cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, oven-dry bulk density, soil texture, calcium carbonate etc. Different morphometric parameters like drainage density, stream frequency, form factor, circulatory ratio, elongation ratio, bifurcation ratio, relief ratio, relative relief, etc., were analyzed in relation to the development of water resources in the watershed. A circulatory ratio of 0.56 indicated that the shape of the basin was fairly elongated and suggested that the area was not prone to flood. The elongated shape, together with a moderate bifurcation ratio (3.01), indicates moderate flow, moderate runoff and moderate sediment yield. A low drainage density (2.7 km/km2) furthermore implies the presence of permeable strata with high groundwater prospects and supports the assumption of moderate runoff and sediment yield. After studying potentials and prospects of soil hydro-physical properties and morphometric parameters, a suggested land use alternative was implemented in representative, rainfed rice areas of the watershed and was found to be more productive and more profitable.
