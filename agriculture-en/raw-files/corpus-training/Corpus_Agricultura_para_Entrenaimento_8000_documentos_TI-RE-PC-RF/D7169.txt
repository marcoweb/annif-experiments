#ITI#Water and salt regulation and its effects on Leymus chinensis growth under drip irrigation in saline-sodic soils of the Songnen Plain#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were carried out to investigate water and salt management and its effects on Leymus chinensis growth under drip irrigation on saline-sodic soils of the Songnen Plain, China. The ECe of the experiment soil here is 15.2dS/m and SARe is 14.6 (mmolcL-1)1/2. The threshold of soil matric potential (SMP) was preset in different treatments (-5, -10, -15, -20 and -25kPa) to control the timing of the irrigation cycle using vacuum tensiometers buried at 0.2m depth immediately under drip emitters. Drip irrigation frequency and soil matric potential significantly influenced water and salt distributions and L. chinensis growth. In the root zone, the soil water content increased with the SMP, but at deeper layers there were no significant differences in soil water content due to the effect of groundwater. Electrical conductivity showed that there was a low-salt zone near the emitters and that drip irrigation inhibited the buildup of salts in the root zone. There was more leaching of salts for -5 and -10kPa treatments than for the -15, -20 and -25kPa treatments. After two years of drip irrigation, the surface salts were well leached, and had moved down with the water to depths below 40cm. The pH of each treatment was a little decreased and the soil nutrient of S1-S5 were all increased after reclamation, but there were no obvious differences of the five treatments. The best growth was achieved with soil matric potentials of -5 and -10kPa: the plant height, number and length of spikes, number of tillers, coverage and aboveground biomass all attained their maximum values during the growth periods of L. chinensis, with no significant differences between those two treatments. Thus, in the Songnen Plain, drip irrigation can be used on transplanted L. chinensis for restoration of saline-sodic soils. The results provide theoretical and technological guidance for sustainable reclamation salt-affected soil and the quick restoration and reconstruction of saline-sodic grassland.
