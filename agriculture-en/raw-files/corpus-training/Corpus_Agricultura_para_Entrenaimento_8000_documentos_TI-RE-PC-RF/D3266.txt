#ITI#Increasing Productivity of Lentil (Lens culinaris) using Improved Varieties under Alluvial Soil of Uttar Pradesh by Cluster Front Line Demonstrations#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Pulses are one of the major crops in India and is better for income generation as well as nutritional security. Pulses are the dry edible seeds of pod plants and are high in protein and fibre and low in fat. Lentils are a pulse crops that is part of legume family. But the productivity of lentil is low in Ghazipur district due to unavailability of quality seed and unawareness of improved crop production technology. It is felt that there is shortage of quality seeds of newer varieties of pulses. Methods: The present study carried out by Krishi Vigyan Kendra, PG College Ghazipur through cluster front line demonstrations (CFLD) on lentil (Masoor) using improved varieties PL-8 and IPL-316 with seed rate @40 kg/ha. The 135 demonstration were conducted during Rabi season of the year 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2020-21 in three clusters of Devkali block of district Ghazipur. The soils condition was sandy loam in texture having low in pH with 6.2-6.9, Organic carbon (0.39-0.4.3%) and available P2 O5 (18-21 kg/ha) and medium in N and K content. Result: The technology of improved variety viz. PL-8 and IPL-316 increased the average productivity by 32.53%, 59.69% and 44.85% and increased the net return by Rs. 15,431.00, with an improved B:C ratio of 3.34 instead of 2.54, Rs. 24,572.00 with an improved B:C ratio of 3.58 instead of 2.42 and Rs. 20,585.00 with an improved B:C ratio of 3.93 instead of 2.97 than those of local check variety choti masoor during the three consecutive years respectively. Soil health and soil nitrogen was also improved along with better nodulation in the demonstration plots. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
