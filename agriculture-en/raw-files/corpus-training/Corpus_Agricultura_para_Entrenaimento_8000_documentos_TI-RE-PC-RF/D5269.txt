#ITI#Effect of in ovo administered reovirus vaccines on immune responses of specific-pathogen-free chickens#FTI#
#IRE#We investigated the effect of in ovo administered reovirus vaccines on the immune responses of specific-pathogen-free chickens. T-cell mitogenic responses to concanavalin A were numerically lower at 9 and 12 days of age and significantly lower at 6 days of age in birds vaccinated with a commercial reovirus vaccine compared with unvaccinated birds or birds vaccinated with an experimental reovirus-antibody complex vaccine. There were no significant differences in proportions of subpopulations of helper (CD4+CD8 -) or cytotoxic (CD4-CD8+) T cells except at 12 days of age, when the percentages of CD4-CD8+ cells in the two vaccinated groups were statistically higher than in the nonvaccinated group. B-cell populations were not different among vaccine groups except at 9 days of age, when the vaccinated groups had the highest level of B cells. This commercial reovirus vaccine should not be given in ovo to embryos having little or no maternal antibody, otherwise immunosuppression may occur in the chicks. The addition of the antibody complex to the vaccine prevented this T-cell immunosuppression.#FRE#
