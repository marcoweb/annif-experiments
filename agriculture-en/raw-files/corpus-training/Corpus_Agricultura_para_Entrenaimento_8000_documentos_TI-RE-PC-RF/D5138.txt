#ITI#Molecular characterization of avian infectious bronchitis virus strains isolated in Colombia during 2003#FTI#
#IRE#Sixteen infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) isolates were recovered from broilers and layers from five geographic poultry regions in Colombia. The viruses were isolated from tracheas, lungs, and cecal tonsils of birds, previously vaccinated with the Massachusetts strain, that were showing respiratory signs. Further analysis of the IBV isolates was achieved by phylogenetic analysis comparing their deduced amino acid sequences in the hypervariable region 1 of the S1 gene with reference strains. Four unique genotype clusters containing isolates with indigenous genotypes were observed. One isolate was found to be the Connecticut genotype and three isolates were found to be the Massachusetts genotype.#FRE#
