#ITI#First record of outdoor occurrence of stored-product coleopterans in arable landscape in poland#FTI#
#IRE#70 samples of insects caught in a Johnson suction trap were taken during the vegetative period in 2009. The trap was sited in the Experimental Station Institute of Plant Protection - National Research Institute in Winna GÃ³ra, Poland. The samples contained 2 869 beetles (Coleoptera) of which 393 (13.7%) are known as stored product pests. 63 specimens of beetle Rhizopertha dominica (F.) were caught. It is the first recorded occurrence in Poland of such an economically important stored product pest isolated outside the storage environment.#FRE#
