#ITI#Drought tolerance in some populations of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus l.)#FTI#
#IRE#In Algeria, the genus Lathyrus is cultivated mainly for grain production (food) and also used as fodder (animal feed). Lathyrus sativus L. or grass pea has a good resistance to drought, salinity and flooding. However, its place is still very limited compared to that of other pulse crops. The objective of this study was the evaluation of 05 Algerian populations and 2 varieties of Lathyrus sativus under drought stress applied during the flowering stage. ANOVA analysis showed that water stress at flowering stage had a significant genotype effect for most traits and significant genotype x stress interaction for flowering date, number of pods, pods weight, number of seeds per pod and seed yield per plant. 21 Lat, 4Lat4-2 and 1Lat-1 genotypes having high performance for pod length, weight pod per plant, seed yield per plant, biological yield and 1000-seed weight are more tolerant to drought. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
