#IRE#The morphogenesis of duck enteritis virus (DEV) and distribution in vivo were observed by electron microscopy after ducks were infected experimentally with DEV virulent strain. The investigation showed that a few typical herpesvirus virions and nucleocapsids were first observed in the spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius (BF), and many nucleocapsids, mature viruses, and viral inclusion bodies could be found in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected liver, small intestine, spleen, thymus, and BF when the ducks died. Nucleocapsids assembled both in nucleus and cytoplasm and could be divided into four different types according to their structures. Typical herpesvirus, light particles (L-particles), and virions without tegument could be observed at the same time. With the replication, assembly, and maturation of the viruses, intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies, electron-density particles, microtubules, hollow tubes, and coated electron-density bodies were observed in infected cells.#FRE#
