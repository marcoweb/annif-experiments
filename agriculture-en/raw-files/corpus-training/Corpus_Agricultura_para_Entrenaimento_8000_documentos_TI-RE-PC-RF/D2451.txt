#ITI#Effect of plant densities and different environments on productivity and profitability of yardlong bean (Vigna unguiculata sub sp. sesquipedalis)#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation was carried out during Kharif 2016 at ZAHRS, Navile, Shivamogga. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with three replications. There were 24 treatment combinations comprised of three different environments (polyhouse, shadenet and open field) and eight spacing treatments (45 cm x 30 cm, 45 cm x 45 cm, 45 cm x 60 cm, 45 cm x 75 cm, 60 cm x 30 cm, 60 cm x 45 cm, 60 cm x 60 cm, 60 cm x 75 cm). The obtained results showed that all the characters were markedly affected by different environments and spacing. Among different environments significantly higher plant height (325.17cm), number of primary branches (12.46), number of pods per plant (21.66), pod length (70.67 cm), pod girth (3.73 cm), pod weight per plant (31.13 g), yield per plant (458.21 g) and higher pod yield per 1000 m2 (1605.99 kg) were recorded in polyhouse. Among spacing treatments significantly higher number of primary branches (12.91), pods per plant (22.30), pod length (71.73 cm), pod girth (3.94 cm), pod weight per plant (33.11g) and pod yield per plant (547.86 g) were recorded with wider spacing of 60 cm x 75 cm. Highest plant height (294.29 cm) and yield per 1000 m2 (1791.68 kg) were recorded with the closer spacing of 45 cm x 30 cm. The interaction of different environments and spacing were found to be statistically non-significant for all the traits. The evaluation of production economics revealed that growing of Yardlong bean in open condition with 45 cm x 30 cm spacing was most remunerative option with a highest benefit: Cost of 3.14.
