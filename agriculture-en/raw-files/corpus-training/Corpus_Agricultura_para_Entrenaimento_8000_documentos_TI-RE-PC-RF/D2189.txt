#ITI#Nitrogen fixation by pea and lentil green manures in a semi-arid agroecoregion: Effect of planting and termination timing#FTI#
#IRE#Crop-fallow systems dominate many semi-arid agricultural regions despite fallow's negative effects on soil and water quality. Annual legumes grown as a fallow-replacement crop, and terminated prior to maturity, can reduce these negative effects without substantially decreasing plant available water for the subsequent crop. Interest in growing legume green manures (LGMs) in synthetically-fertilized systems is increasing in the northern Great Plains of North America, partly due to the N-fixing capabilities of legumes; however, little is known about the effects of planting and termination time on N fixation amounts in the region. A 2-year field study was initiated in southwest Montana to determine the effects of planting time (spring or summer) and termination time (e. g. flower or pod) on the amount of N fixed by field pea (Pisum sativum cv. Arvika) and lentil (Lensculinaris cv. Richlea). Two methods, 15N natural abundance and N difference, were used to quantify N fixation, with wheat or in-crop weeds as reference plants. In 2009, N fixed by spring-planted lentil was higher by pod than flower (P = 0.03). Termination time did not affect the amount of N fixed by spring-planted pea, despite more biomass by pod than flower. In 2010, both spring-planted crops fixed more N by pod than flower (P < 0.01) and more N was fixed by spring-planted than summer-planted crops (P < 0.01). These results should prove useful to growers interested in selecting management practices that optimize N fixation of LGMs. Â© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
