#ITI#Analysis of a two-component hydrograph separation model to predict herbicide runoff in drained soils#FTI#
#IRE#This paper evaluates the use of a two-component hydrograph separation model to predict the leaching of two relatively soluble herbicides, isoproturon and simazine, from an agricultural drained clay soil. The model successfully predicted the pattern and extent of herbicide leaching in drainflow at a 15-min time interval using electrical conductivity of rainfall and drainflow as the single chemical parameter. Analysis of the hydrological characteristics of individual rainfall events allowed current sources of uncertainty in the model to be identified and highlighted areas for further research. For example, future use of the model should incorporate the measurement of intra-event variations in electrical conductivity of rainfall as an input in order to improve model accuracy and precision. Repeated under-estimation of herbicide concentration in drainflow when suspended sediment concentrations were elevated indicated that desorption hysteresis may have occurred at the soil surface and during transport through the tile drain system. This resulted in the transport of a greater proportion of herbicide through preferential pathways in sediment-associated form than predicted by assuming an instantaneous desorption at the soil surface. The results of the research suggest that the nature and importance of sediment-associated herbicide transport through tile drains warrants further investigation. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.
