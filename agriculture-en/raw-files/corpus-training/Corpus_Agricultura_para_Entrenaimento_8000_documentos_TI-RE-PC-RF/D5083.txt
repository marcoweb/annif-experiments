#ITI#Susceptibility and protection of naïve and vaccinated racing pigeons (Columbia livia) against exotic Newcastle disease virus from the California 2002-2003 outbreak#FTI#
#IRE#The susceptibility, immune response, and protection to challenge after vaccination in racing pigeons (Columbia livia) was assessed with the 2002-2003 exotic Newcastle disease (END) virus responsible for the most recent major outbreak in Southern California. Immunologically naïve pigeons appeared resistant to disease, regardless of dose, after a natural route of exposure. Twenty percent morbidity was observed in each group of birds receiving between 102.1 and 108.1 50% embryo infectious dose (EID50) per bird, with one bird succumbing to challenge in the 108.1 EID50/bird group at day 12 postinoculation. Although resistant to disease, birds in all groups continued to shed virus from either oral or cloacal route at the end of the 14-day sampling period, and seroconversion was only observed in birds receiving ≥106.1 EID50. Single or double vaccination of juvenile and adult birds with pigeon paramyxovirus virus type 1 (PPMV-1) vaccine followed by END challenge with 106.1 EID50/bird decreased the duration, incidence, and viral load. A positive correlation was observed between the presence of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers at challenge and decreased viral shedding. Overt clinical signs of disease were not observed in any PPMV-1-vaccinated birds after challenge.#FRE#
