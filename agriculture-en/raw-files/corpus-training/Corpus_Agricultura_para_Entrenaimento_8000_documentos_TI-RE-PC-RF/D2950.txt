#ITI#Yield and quality of cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.)Walp] as influenced by organic sources of nitrogen#FTI#
#IRE#                             A field experiment conducted during kharif season of the year 2015 at Agronomy Instructional Farm, C.P. College of Agriculture, Sardar krushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University, Sardar krushinagar Gujrat. Application of T                             9                              (50% N through castor cake + 50% N through vermicompost + PSB) and T                             10                             : (RDF: 20+40+00 kg ha                             -1                              NPK through fertilizer) recorded higher plant growth and development. Remarkable increase in yield attributes and seed yield (1033 kg/ha) were noted with an application of 50% N through castor cake + 50% N through vermicompost + PSB (T                             9                             ). Significant improvement in protein content in seed and protein yield, N content in seed, Stover yield and N uptake by cowpea were noted with application of 50% N through FYM + 50% N through vermicompost + PSB (T                             8                             ), whereas, higher N content in stover and P content in seed were recorded under treatment T                             9                              (50% N through castor cake + 50% N through vermicompost + PSB). Treatment T                             10                              (RDF: 20+40+00 kg ha                             -1                              NPK through fertilizer) realized higher net realization (42371ha                             -1                             ) and BCR (2.83) because organic fertilizer per unit cost higher than inorganic fertilizer.
