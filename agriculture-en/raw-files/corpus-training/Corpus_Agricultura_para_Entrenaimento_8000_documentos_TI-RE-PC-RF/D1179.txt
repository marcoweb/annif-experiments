#ITI#Low light stress promotes new tiller regeneration by changing source–sink relationship and activating expression of expansin genes in wheat#FTI#
#IRE#Low light stress seriously decreased wheat grain number through the formation of aborted spike during the reproductive period and induced new tiller regeneration to offset the loss of grain number. However, the mechanism by which plants coordinate spike aborted growth and the regeneration of new tillers remains unknown. To better understand this coordinated process, morphological, physiological and transcriptomic analyses were performed under low light stress at the young microspore stage. Our findings indicated that leaves exhausted most stored carbohydrates in 1 day of darkness. However, spike and uppermost internode (UI) were converted from sink to source, due to increased abscisic acid (ABA) content and decreased cytokinin content. During this process, genes encoding amylases, Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEET) and sucrose transporters or sucrose carriers (SUT/SUC) were upregulated in spike and UI, which degraded starch into soluble sugars and loaded them into the phloem. Subsequently, soluble sugars were transported to tiller node (TN) where cytokinin and auxin content increased and ABA content decreased, followed by unloading into TN cells by upregulated cell wall invertase (CWINV) genes and highly expressed H+/hexose symporter genes. Finally, expansin genes integrated the sugar pathway and hormone pathway, and regulate the formation of new tillers directly. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
