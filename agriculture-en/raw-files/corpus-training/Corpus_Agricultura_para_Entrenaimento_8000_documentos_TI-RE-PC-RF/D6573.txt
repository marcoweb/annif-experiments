#ITI#Herbarium specimens reveal herbivory patterns across the genus Cucurbita#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Quantifying how closely related plant species differ in susceptibility to insect herbivory is important for understanding the variation in evolutionary pressures on plant functional traits. However, empirically measuring in situ variation in herbivory spanning the geographic range of a plant–insect complex is logistically difficult. Recently, new methods have been developed using herbarium specimens to investigate patterns in plant–insect symbioses across large geographic scales. Such investigations provide insights into how accelerated anthropogenic changes may impact plant–insect interactions that are of ecological or agricultural importance. Methods: Here, we analyze 274 pressed herbarium samples to investigate variation in herbivory damage in 13 different species of the economically important plant genus Cucurbita (Cucurbitaceae). This collection is composed of specimens of wild, undomesticated Cucurbita that were collected from across their native range, and Cucurbita cultivars collected from both within their native range and from locations where they have been introduced for agriculture in temperate North America. Results: Herbivory is common on individuals of all Cucurbita species collected throughout their geographic ranges. However, estimates of herbivory varied considerably among individuals, with mesophytic species accruing more insect damage than xerophytic species, and wild specimens having more herbivory than specimens collected from human-managed habitats. Conclusions: Our study suggests that long-term evolutionary changes in habitat from xeric to mesic climates and wild to human-managed habitats may mediate the levels of herbivory pressure from coevolved herbivores. Future investigations into the potential factors that contribute to herbivory may inform the management of domesticated crop plants and their insect herbivores. © 2023 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
