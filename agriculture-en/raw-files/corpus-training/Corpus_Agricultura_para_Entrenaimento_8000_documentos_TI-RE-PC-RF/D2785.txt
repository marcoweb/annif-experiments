#ITI#Stability analysis for seed yield and their component traits in breeding lines of guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Seed yield performances and stability indices were calculated for thirteen genotypes of cluster bean evaluated for two years (2008-09 and 2009-10) at two locations in North Gujarat to identify phenotypically stable genotypes for seed yield and its component traits. Pooled analysis of variance for stability in the performance of different genotypes of guar were highly significant for all the characters viz., days to 50% flowering, days to 75% maturity, pods per plant, plant height, and seed yield except pod length and seeds per pod. The G X E interaction for all the characters were significant and the significant mean square due to environment (linear) indicated the existence of the real genotypic differences in the characters for regression over the environmental mean. The genotypes namely GAUG-0309, GAUG-0416, GAUG-0513 and GAUG-0522 were found stable for eariiness and they can be directly used for breeding for earliness. For improvement of seed yield, the genotypes viz., GAUG-0309 and GAUG-0511 were the most stable under rainfed situation.#FRE#
