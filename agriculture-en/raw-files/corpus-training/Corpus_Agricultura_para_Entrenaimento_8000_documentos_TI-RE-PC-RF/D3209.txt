#ITI#Selection of high-yielding, high-tech varieties of field pea (Pisum sativum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#One of the major challenges facing the selection of leguminous crops, and pea in particular, is to increase their technological properties and yield. An important problem is also the increase of protein content in the seeds. The aim of this work was to create a high-tech variety of field peas with a short growing period. By repeated individual selection from the hybrid population of the Chishminsky 95 × Usach field pea, a precocious, highly productive PamyatiHangildina variety of pea (leafless) was obtained. The combination of new mutant traits in one plant (seed shedding-def gene, leafless type-af gene) and elements of productivity structure with optimal level of their development allowed the variety to successfully pass all tests and in 2012 it was included in the State Register of Selection Achievements of the Russian Federation. For an average of 5 years of competitive testing, the variety had a seed yield of 1.62 t/ha, exceeding the standard (control) by 0.67 t/ha. The created variety has a short growing period and a high content of protein in the seeds. The research results could be successfully used in the selection of improved peas. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
