#ITI#Soil greenhouse gas emissions from an animal excrement-based forage cropping system#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted to investigate the impacts of animal excrement-derived organic soil amendments on N2O, CH4, and heterotrophic CO2 emissions and net soil-associated greenhouse gas balances under an Italian ryegrass and forage corn double-cropping system on an Andosol in southwestern Japan. The experiment consisted of five treatments with three replicates: no nitrogen, chemical fertilizer (CF), composted dairy cattle manure (CCM), dairy slurry (DS), and digestate from biogas production (DBP). There were no significant differences in cumulative soil N2O emissions over three years among the CF, CCM, DS, and DBP treatments. Although N2O emission factors (a percent ratio of N2O-N emitted to N applied) were all quite low, the factor for composted dairy cattle manure (0.00 ± 0.02%) was significantly lower than that for chemical fertilizer (0.06 ± 0.01%). The soil was a net CH4 sink, and there were no significant differences in cumulative CH4 emissions among the five treatments. Soil CO2 emissions (i.e., heterotrophic soil respiration) increased in proportion to the organic carbon inputs from organic soil amendments. For dairy slurry, which contains abundant labile organic carbon, the decomposition of organic carbon was more pronounced during the summer corn season than during the winter ryegrass season. The contributions of soil N2O and CH4 emissions to soil-associated net greenhouse gas balance were negligible on a CO2-equivalent basis. All five treatments acted as a net source of greenhouse gases, but the CCM and DS treatments mitigated greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere in comparison with the CF treatment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
