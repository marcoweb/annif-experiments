#ITI#Source-sink coordinated peanut cultivar increases yield and kernel protein content through enhancing photosynthetic characteristics and regulating carbon and nitrogen metabolisms#FTI#
#IRE#The grain yield of crops is determined by the synergistic interaction between source activity and sink capacity. However, source-sink interactions are far from being fully understood of peanut. Therefore, a 2-year field study (2018–2019) was conducted to compare differences in photosynthetic characteristics, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and yield and quality of different source–sink peanut varieties. Four representative source–sink types were examined: JH5 (source–sink coordination type), SH9 (sufficient source–large sink type), ZH24 (sufficient source–few sink type), and HY36 (large source–few sink type). The results showed that the photosynthetic potential of HY36 was higher than that of the other varieties after flowering because of a large source (leaves), whereas the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate of HY36 were significantly lower than those of JH5 and ZH24. Proportions of dry matter transferred to pods were significantly different among four source–sink peanut varieties. From 50 days after flowering, the dry matter distribution ratio of pods exceeded that of stems and leaves in JH5, significantly earlier than other varieties, which prolong the duration of pod-filling period, followed by SH9 and ZH24. The activities of nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and glutamate synthase in JH5 were the highest among the varieties, and thus, the highest protein content was also in JH5. The activities of sucrose synthase and sucrose phosphate synthase in ZH24 were significantly higher than those in HY36. The highest oil content was also in ZH24. Among pod sink characteristics and yield, SH9 had the longest flowering period and the highest gynophore formation rate but the lowest pod-bearing rate, and the effective proportion and pod fullness were also lower than those of other varieties. The highest pod rate was in ZH24. The effective proportion and pod fullness of JH5 were higher than those of the other varieties, and its yield was also the highest, followed by SH9 and ZH24, with the lowest yield in HY36. The obtained results indicate that the source–sink coordinated variety had high Pn and chlorophyll content in the late growth stage, a long functional period of leaves, and a high proportion of assimilates transported to pods, thus promoting effective proportions and pod fullness to improve peanut yield and protein content, suggesting that different cultivation and management measures should select for different peanut varieties to best coordinate the relationship between the source and sink. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
