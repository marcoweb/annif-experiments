#ITI#Comprehensive profiling of endogenous phytohormones and expression analysis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase gene family during fruit development and ripening in octoploid strawberry (Fragaria× ananassa)#FTI#
#IRE#The non-climacteric octoploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne ex Rozier) was used as a model to study its regulation during fruit ripening. High performance liquid chromatography electrospray tandem-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was employed to profile 28 different endogenous phytohormones in strawberry. These include auxins, cytokinins (CKs), abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), jasmonates, and phenolic compounds salicylic acid (SA), benzoic acid (BzA) and phenylacetic acid (PAA) together with their various metabolic forms that have remained largely unexplored thus far. ABA, ACC and CK N6-(Δ2-isopentenyl)adenine (iP) were found to be associated with ripening while ABA catabolites 9-hydroxy-ABA and phaseic acid mimicked the pattern of climacteric decline at the turning phase of strawberry ripening. The content of other CK forms except iP decreased as fruit ripened, as also that of auxins indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and oxo-IAA, and of jasmonates. Data presented here also suggest that both the transition and progression of strawberry fruit ripening are associated with N6-(Δ2-isopentenyl)adenosine-5′-monophosphate (iPRMP) → N6-(Δ2-isopentenyl)adenosine (iPR) → iP as the preferred CK metabolic pathway. In contrast, the ethylene precursor ACC was present at higher levels, with its abundance increasing from the onset of ripening to the red ripe stage. Further investigation of ripening-specific ACC accumulation revealed the presence of a large ACC synthase (ACS) encoding gene family in octoploid strawberry that was previously unknown. Seventeen ACS genes were found differentially expressed in fruit tissues, while six of them showed induced expression during strawberry fruit ripening. These data suggest a possible role(s) of ACC, ABA, and iP in strawberry fruit ripening. These data add new dimension to the existing knowledge of the interplay of different endogenous phytohormones in octoploid strawberry, paving the way for further investigation of their individual role(s) in fruit ripening. © 2023#FRE#
