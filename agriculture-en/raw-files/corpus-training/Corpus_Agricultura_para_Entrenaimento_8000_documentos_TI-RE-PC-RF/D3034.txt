#ITI#Variations in osmo-regulatory and anti-oxidative status and their links with total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in lucerne during re-growth#FTI#
#IRE#This study aimed to find out the changes in osmo-regulatory and anti-oxidative status during lucerne re-growth, elucidating their possible links with total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations. The concentrations of osmo-regulatory substances, the activities of anti-oxidative enzymes and malondialdehyde concentration tended to increase after mowing. Total N and P concentrations decreased from 13 to 18 d after mowing. All responses were organ-specific. There were negative correlations of total N and P concentrations with osmo-regulatory and anti-oxidative status mostly in stems. © 2019; Agricultural Research Communication Centre, All rights reserved.#FRE#
