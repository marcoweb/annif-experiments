#ITI#Virucidal Properties of Bioceramic Derived from Chicken Feces pH 13 and its Stability in Harsh Environments#FTI#
#IRE#Bioceramic derived from chicken feces (BCX) is a material produced by a sintering process for the purpose of use in animal farms to control livestock infectious diseases. In the present study, BCX at pH 13 was evaluated for the durability of its virucidal activity in simulated field conditions. First it was shown that BCX had activity toward Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, and goose parvovirus within 3 min and toward avian influenza virus (AIV) within 1 hr. BCX was further tested by keeping it under simulated harsh environmental conditions with sunlight for several weeks as well as by repeatedly soaking it with water and drying under sunlight many times. After sampling every 2 consecutive weeks and every 2 (of 9) consecutive resuspensions, BCX was evaluated for its efficacy against AIV. Evaluation under the harsh conditions illustrated that BCX could retain its satisfactory efficacy toward AIV throughout 7 wk and through 9 resuspensions. It is hence concluded that BCX is an excellent material for applying in livestock farming as a trapping disinfectant, due to its efficacy to inactivate various viruses, and that this efficacy is prolonged even under harsh environmental conditions.
