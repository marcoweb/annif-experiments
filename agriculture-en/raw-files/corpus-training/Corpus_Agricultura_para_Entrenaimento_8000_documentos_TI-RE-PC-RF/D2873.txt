#ITI#Genotype X environment interaction and stability analysis for grain yield in blackgram (Vigna Mungo L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Eleven genotypes of blackgram were tested at three locations viz. Dharwad, Bidar and Gulbarga that represented different agro-climatic conditions of North-Karnataka during kharif 2009 to study their yield stability. Pooled analysis of variance and stability analysis were performed. The genotype (G) x environment (E) interaction and both variance due to genotypes and environments were significant. The partitioning of G x E interaction into linear and non-linear components indicated that both predictable and unpredictable components shared the interaction. On the basis of stability parameters, the top yielding genotypes, K-7-7 (1050 kg/ha) and DU-1 (1024 kg/ha) exhibited the stable performance over the locations. Results also revealed that the genotypes; BDU-3-3, T-9 and DU-3 also gave higher yield. But their performance was unpredictable due to high deviation from regression.#FRE#
