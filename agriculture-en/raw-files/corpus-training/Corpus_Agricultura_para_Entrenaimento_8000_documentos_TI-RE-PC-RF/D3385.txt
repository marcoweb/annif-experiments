#ITI#First report of Fusarium solani causing stem rot of Dracaena in Iran#FTI#
#IRE#In July 2013, symptoms of stem rot were observed in the Dracaena sanderiana cuttings in greenhouses of Mahallat County, Markazi Province, Iran. The symptoms first appeared as severe wilting. Later, leaves became brown and necrotic. Symptoms on the cuttings were observed as rotted areas on the middle of the stems. The cortical tissues of the plants showed a distinct brown discoloration. Eventually, the infected plants died. The pathogen was isolated from Dracaena stems and identified as F. solani by a fragment of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α) gene. Fusarium solani was confirmed by a pathogenicity test, and the causal agent was re-isolated from infected D. sanderiana plants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of stem rot caused by F. solani on the cuttings of D. sanderiana. © by Doustmorad Zafari 2016.#FRE#
