#ITI#Selection of Suitable Genotypes of Urdbean (Vigna mungo L.) for Targeted Environments of Hilly Terrains of India using GGE Biplot and AMMI Analysis#FTI#
#IRE#Understanding of genotypic interactions is highly instrumental in urdbean towards identification of suitable genotypes with wider adaptability. Therefore, present experiment with 20 diverse urdbean genotypes was executed over three environments in northern hilly terrain under rainfed conditions. AMMI analysis revealed that environments (E), genotypes (G) and G ✕ E interaction effects were found significant for grain yield (GY). The environment, genotypes and their interactions accounted 46.29%, 25.9% and 22.23% of the total variation. The interaction principal components Axis 1(IPCA 1) and IPCA 2 of AMMI were founds significant (P < 0.01) for GY based on Gallob’s test.  The IPCA1 accounted more than 89% of the G x E interactions effects for the GY. In GGE biplot PC1 and PC2 captured 99.3% of the total variations. Based on GGE and AMMI biplots the genotypes with wider adaptability were VBG 12-034(G7), IPU 13-3(G16) and COBG 13-04(G13). These genotypes are suitable for hilly terrains of northern India and can be further utilized as donor in future urdbean improvement programme. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
