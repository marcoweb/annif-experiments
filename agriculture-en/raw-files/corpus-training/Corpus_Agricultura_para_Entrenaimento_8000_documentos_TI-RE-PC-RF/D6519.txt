#ITI#Plant physical defenses contribute to a latitudinal gradient in resistance to insect herbivory within a widespread perennial grass#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Herbivore pressure can vary across the range of a species, resulting in different defensive strategies. If herbivory is greater at lower latitudes, plants may be better defended there, potentially driving a latitudinal gradient in defense. However, relationships that manifest across the entire range of a species may be confounded by differences within genetic subpopulations, which may obscure the drivers of these latitudinal gradients. Methods: We grew plants of the widespread perennial grass Panicum virgatum in a common garden that included genotypes from three genetic subpopulations spanning an 18.5° latitudinal gradient. We then assessed defensive strategies of these plants by measuring two physical resistance traits—leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf ash, a proxy for silica—and multiple measures of herbivory by caterpillars of the generalist herbivore fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). Results: Across all genetic subpopulations, low-latitude plants experienced less herbivory than high-latitude plants. Within genetic subpopulations, however, this relationship was inconsistent—the most widely distributed and phenotypically variable subpopulation (Atlantic) exhibited more consistent latitudinal trends than either of the other two subpopulations. The two physical resistance traits, LMA and leaf ash, were both highly heritable and positively associated with resistance to different measures of herbivory across all subpopulations, indicating their importance in defense against herbivores. Again, however, these relationships were inconsistent within subpopulations. Conclusions: Defensive gradients that occur across the entire species range may not arise within localized subpopulations. Thus, identifying the drivers of latitudinal gradients in herbivory defense may depend on adequately sampling the diversity within a species. © 2023 The Authors.
