#ITI#Efficient application of trichoderma viride on soybean [Glycine max (L.) merrill] seed using thin layer polymer coating#FTI#
#IRE#Soybean crop is very sensitive to change in climate and suffers from vagaries of climate. The productivity thus gets affected in different years due to the influence of climatic condition, incidence of diseases and insects. Trichoderma sp. is considered as a potential biocontrol and growth promoting agents for many crop plants. Trichoderma spp. is generally being applied to the soil and seed as talcum powder form. Though powder formulations may be applied directly to seeds at the rate of 5g/kg seed, the effectiveness of Trichoderma seed treatment is lost due to poor adhesion on the smooth seed coat surface of soybean. Thus, it was targeted to achieve maximum benefit by Trichoderma seed treatment mediated through polymer coating. Two soybean cultivars were treated with Trichoderma viride with different formulation namely Trichoderma culture solution with polymer, Trichoderma culture talc with polymer, Trichoderma culture talc powder dry dressing. Endophytic growth of Trichoderma viride in root, stem and leaf was studied by agar plate method at 27±1C for seven days. The percentage of plants with Trichoderma endophytic growth was 97-100 per cent in plants from seeds treated with Trichoderma with polymer as compared to 37-45 per cent in plants from seeds treated with Trichoderma talc powder dry dressing. Control plants did not show any endophytic growth of Trichoderma. Significant increase in plant height was observed due to endophytic growth of Trichoderma. 24 per cent yield advantage was observed due to Trichoderma culture solution treatment with polymer. Seedling mortality due to collar rot (0.61%) and disease incidence of Myrothecium Leaf Spot, Anthracnose and Rhizoctonia Arial Blight (0.34%) was significantly lower than control (9.8% and 9.169%). Proper application of Trichoderma viride on soybean seed through polymer coating has significant potential to reduce diseases and to improve plant growth and seed yield. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
