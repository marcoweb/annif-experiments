#ITI#Integrated phosphorus management in maize–chickpea cropping system on alkaline Fluvisol#FTI#
#IRE#                             In tropical agro-ecosystem, crop production is constrained by the reduced availability of soil phosphorus (P) due to strong P fixation. A field experiment was conducted for five cropping seasons on an alkaline Fluvisol to assess the integrated effect of six system-based fertilizer P rate (kg P                             2                             O                             5                              ha                             −1                             ) in maize (M)–chickpea (C) rotation [M                             0                             –C                             0                             , M                             0                             –C                             40                             , M                             30                             –C                             0                             , M                             30                             –C                             40                             , M                             60                             –C                             0                             , M                             60                             –C                             40                             ], two manure treatments [no farmyard manure (FYM), FYM at 5 t ha                             −1                             ], and two phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) treatments [no PSB, PSB seed treatment in chickpea] on soil available-P, soil–plant P dynamics, balance, P use efficiency, and system productivity. Combined application of fertilizer P and FYM had a strong positive impact on soil available-P, soil biochemical properties, P acquisition and crop productivity. Conversely, the effect of PSB was marginal.

The order of fertilizer P treatments for P uptake and annual P balance was M                             60                             –C                             40                              > M                             30                             –C                             40                              > M                             60                             –C                             0                              > M                             0                             –C                             40                              > M                             30                             –C                             0                              > M                             0                             –C                             0                             . FYM application improved P recovery efficiency by 71%. Soil microbial biomass carbon, dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase, and soil pH had significant relationship with available-P (p < 0.01). Notably, treatments M                             30                             –C                             0                              + FYM + PSB and M                             60                             –C                             40                              − FYM − PSB had a similar effect on maize productivity (4.1–4.2 t ha                             −1                             ). Likewise, treatments M                             60                             –C                             0                              + FYM + PSB and M                             60                             –C                             40                              − FYM − PSB were comparable for chickpea productivity (p > 0.05). Therefore, integration of manure and fertilizer P is recommended for increasing the productivity and P use efficiency in maize–chickpea rotation in tropical alkaline soil.                          © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
