#ITI#Influence of production factors on seed quality parameters of green gram (Vignaradiata) CV. KKM-3#FTI#
#IRE#                             A field and laboratory experiment was conducted at Department of Seed Science and Technology, GKVK, UAS, Bangalore during 2014 to assess the response of fertilizer levels and spacing on seed quality parameters of green gram (Vigna radiata) cv. KKM-3. Experimental results revealed that fertilizer application of 50:100:100 NPK kg ha                             -1                              + Green gram rhizobium (200gm) + PSB-Bacillus megaterium (200gm) recorded highest seed density (1.69g/cc), Test weight (46.2g), EC (0.750 dsm                             -1                             ) TDH activity (0.999), germination percent age (97.25%), shoot length (21.98cm), rootlength (18.61cm), seedling dry weight (252g), seedlingvigour index I and II (3947 and 2450), protein percent (23.8%) and fieldemergence (90%) superior over other fertilizer treatments.Among the planting geometry 60×10cm recorded highest germination percentage (96.12%) as compared to 45×10cm (94.77%) and 30×10cm (93.82%). Interaction of fertilizerlevels and spacingthrough the application of 50:100:100 NPK kg ha                             -1                              + green gram rhizobium (200gm) + PSB-Bacillus megaterium (200gm) withplantinggeometry 60×10cm recorded higher seed quality parameters viz Test weight (48.3 g), protein per cent (24.5 %), germination percentage (98%), EC (0.73dsm                             -1                             ), TDH activity (1.001), seedling dry weight (265 mg), shoot length (23.65 cm), root length (19.36 cm) and seedling vigour index I and II (4224 and 2603) and field emergence(93%) were observed.                          © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
