#ITI#The comparison of different irrigation methods on yield and water use efficiency of the jujube#FTI#
#IRE#Water shortage restricts the development of jujube plantation in southern Xinjiang, and the application of water–saving irrigation technology is the key to solve this problem. This study investigated the response of irrigation water use efficiency to various irrigation technologies (vertical tube irrigation and surface drip irrigation) and jujube yield and quality, and to choose a suitable irrigation method for Hui–jujube trees planting. The field experiment was conducted over 2 years. Vertical tube irrigation was implemented with three levels of water pressure by using water pressure heads 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2 m. Additionally, surface drip irrigation was used as a control, and four treatments were used in total. The results indicated that vertical tube irrigation helped save approximately 37–70% of water, and its water use efficiency was 1.4–4.3 times that of surface drip irrigation. Compared with Hui–jujube trees watered by drip irrigation, those watered by vertical tube irrigation had slightly higher yield and decreased fruit cracking (25–83%). Moreover, the sugar–acid ratio increased significantly (P < 0.05). Besides, the continuous water supply used in vertical tube irrigation allowed the maintenance of relatively stable SWC in the main root layer (20–60 cm), can provided a good soil–water–air environment for jujube growth. Vertical tube irrigation saved water primarily because it sends water directly to the main root layer through the emitters buried in the soil, reducing the evaporation of water in the upper soil layer. The irrigation water amount of vertical tube irrigation was proportional to the water supply pressure head. Water use efficiency was the highest under the lowest water supply pressure (water pressure head 0.8 m). The present findings provide a scientific basis for the application of vertical tube irrigation in arid areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
