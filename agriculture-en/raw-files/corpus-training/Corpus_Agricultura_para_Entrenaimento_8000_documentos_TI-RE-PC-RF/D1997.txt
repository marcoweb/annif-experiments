#ITI#Polymer-coated urea effects on maize yield and nitrogen losses for hilly land of southern China#FTI#
#IRE#The rational nitrogen (N) application rate for crops depends not only on yield but also on the environmental cost of N loss to the surrounding ecological environment. To explore the environmental and economic optimal N rate (EEONR) for dryland maize in the hilly areas of southern China, a field experiment was conducted with spring maize from 2015 to 2017. Common urea (CU, control, 240 kg N ha−1) and four polymer-coated urea (PCU) fertilization levels (100PCU, 90PCU, 80PCU, 70PCU, which respectively denotes 0, 10%, 20% and 30% reduction of PCU–N application based on the control) were employed in this trial. Maize yield, N loss and economic return were investigated over 3 years. The results were as follows: (1) relative to CU, a 0–20% reduction in the PCU-N application rate did not significantly affect the maize yield during the three consecutive years, however, a 30% reduction in the PCU-N application rate led to significant yield loss in the third year despite the consistent yields achieved in the first 2 years. (2) PCU application significantly abated N loss to the environment, and as N application rate decreased, N loss significantly reduced. Our results showed that a 0–30% reduction in the PCU-N application rate mitigated N loss by 12.8–46.1% via N2O, NH3, runoff and leaching, and the two main N-loss pathways were leaching (55.2–62.2%) and NH3 volatilization (29.8–36.0%). (3) A 0–30% reduction in the PCU-N application rate resulted in a deficit, ranging from 784 to 2438 CNY ha−1 for increased earnings over CU because of the high purchase price of PCU. The net economic benefit was calculated from the N input cost, yield economic income and environment cost of N lost in the treatments with 0, 10%, 20% and 30% reduction of PCU-N and were − 1820 to 14,479, 402 to 14,612, 2306 to 14,613, and 3941 to 14,205 CNY ha−1, respectively, and the net economic benefit of the CU plot was − 4003 to 14,671 CNY ha−1. In summary, our findings suggest that reducing the PCU-N application rate by 20% is a reasonable EEONR for spring maize cultivation in hilly areas of southern China. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
