#ITI#Physical and genomic characteristics identify chicken proventricular necrosis virus (R11/3 virus) as a novel birnavirus#FTI#
#IRE#Chicken proventricular necrosis virus (CPNV), isolate R11/3, previously was isolated from transmissible viral proventriculitis-affected chickens and was determined to be the likely etiology of this disease. CPNV was identified as a birnavirus on the basis of virion size and morphology (icosahedral, approximately 75 nm in diameter, nonenveloped); buoyant density in cesium chloride (1.32 g/ml); a genome comprising bisegmented, double-stranded RNA (approximately 3.8 and 3.4 kilobase pairs); and nucleotide sequence analyses. Nucleotide sequencing of CPNV RNA, segment B, identified a single large open reading frame that encodes a 903-amino acid protein. The 903-amino acid protein was identified as the putative VP1, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), on the basis of sequence homologies with other birnavirus VP1 proteins. The CPNV VP1 possessed the unique permuted RdRp sequence motif arrangement characteristic of birnaviruses; however, phylogenetic analyses based on VP1 demonstrated that CPNV is deeply divergent from other birnaviruses.
