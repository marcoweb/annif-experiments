#ITI#Transmissible viral proventriculitis identified in broiler breeder and layer hens#FTI#
#IRE#Transmissible viral proventriculitis (TVP) is a recognized cause of production losses in broiler chickens, but previously it has not been reported in broiler breeder and commercial layer hens. In this study, TVP was identified in broiler breeder and commercial layer hens, 9-20 wk of age, based on histopathologic detection of characteristic microscopic lesions. Microscopic lesions in proventriculi of affected hens consisted of glandular epithelial necrosis, ductal epithelial hyperplasia, replacement of glandular epithelium with ductal epithelium, and diffuse interstitial lymphoid infiltration. Additionally, chicken proventricular necrosis virus (CPNV), a virus previously identified as the etiology of TVP in broiler chickens, was detected in proventriculi of TVP-affected hens using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction procedure. The findings identify TVP as a potential cause of production losses in broiler breeder and commercial layer hens and provide additional evidence for etiologic involvement in TVP by CPNV.
