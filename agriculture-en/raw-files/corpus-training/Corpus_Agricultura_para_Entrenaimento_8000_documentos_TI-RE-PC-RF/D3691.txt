#ITI#Impact evaluation of Neochetina spp. on different growth stages of waterhyacinth#FTI#
#IRE#An attempt was made to optimize the minimum required inoculation load of the weevils on three growth stages of waterhyacinth, based on reduction of fresh biomass, number of leaves and ramifications. The small growth stage was controlled earlier than the waterhyacinth of middle growth stage, corresponding to the increase in number of weevils per plant. The large plants could not be controlled even with the inoculation pressure of 20 weevils per plant because of high growth rate. This study suggests that Neochetina spp. has the potential to keep the population of the macrophyte at a sub-economic density, through a basic inoculation load of weevils in due course of time.#FRE#
