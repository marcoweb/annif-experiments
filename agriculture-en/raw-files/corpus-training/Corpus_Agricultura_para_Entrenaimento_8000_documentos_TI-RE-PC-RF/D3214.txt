#ITI#Detection of infection preferences of the alfalfa seed chalcid, bruchophagus roddi gussakovskiy, 1933 (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae) in alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) fields of igdir, Turkey#FTI#
#IRE#This study was conducted to estimate the infection of Bruchophagus roddi in 66 alfalfa fields in Igdir, Turkey during the month of August in 2014-2015, and to determine infection preferences of B. roddi for number of pods in a bunch (NPB) and number of seeds in a pod (NSP). CHAID algorithm was preferred in the prediction of the number of seeds damaged (NSD) through district, year, NPB and NSP. In Aralik district, B. roddi preferred the seeds of varieties with NSP≤3.8 (0.858 NSD) at lower rate in 2015. In Karakoyunlu, Tuzluca and Central districts in 2015, varieties with NPB>11 were preferred less but varieties with 9<NPB≤11 were mostly preferred. In the Aralýk and Central districts in the 2014, varieties with NPB>10 were preferred less but varieties whose NSP was greater than 7.6 were preferred at the highest proportion by B. roddi in Aralik district in the 2015. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
