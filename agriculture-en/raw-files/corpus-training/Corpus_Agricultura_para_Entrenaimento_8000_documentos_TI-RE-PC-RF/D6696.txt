#ITI#Integration of economic and hydrologic models: Exploring conjunctive irrigation water use strategies in the Volta Basin#FTI#
#IRE#We describe the development, calibration and preliminary application of a dynamically coupled economic-hydrologic simulation-optimization model ensemble for evaluating the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater in small reservoir-based irrigation systems characteristic of the Volta Basin, Africa. We focus on a representative small reservoir-irrigation system located in the Antakwidi catchment in Ghana. The model ensemble consists of the physical hydrology model WaSiM-ETH and an economic optimization model written in GAMS. Results include optimal water storage and allocation regimes for irrigated production, given conjunctive surface water and groundwater systems. The goal of our research, conducted within the GLOWA Volta project, is to develop a decision support system for improving the management of land and water resources in the face of potential environmental change in the Volta Basin. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.
