#ITI#Development and validation of canopy reflectance-based crop coefficient for potato#FTI#
#IRE#The present paper describes the development and validation of canopy reflectance-based crop coefficients for potato using canopy reflectance (measured using hand-held radiometers and high resolution multispectral digital imagery), and extensive crop biophysical sampling in selected potato growing fields in and around Kimberly, Idaho, during 1998 and 1999 seasons. Daily crop evapotranspiration was estimated using basal and canopy reflectance-based crop coefficients, and a hydrologic water balance was conducted in the plant root zone. Independent measurements of actual soil moisture measurements were made by neutron probe and gravimetric methods, and used to validate the simulated results. The results validate the reflectance-based crop coefficient method. High resolution multispectral aerial imagery was used to highlight the spatial variability of actual crop water demand in the study fields. Â© 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
