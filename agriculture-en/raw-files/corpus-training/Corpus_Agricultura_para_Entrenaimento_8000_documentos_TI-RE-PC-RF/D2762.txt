#ITI#Residual effect of nutrient management on the soil fertility and yield of blackgram under dryland conditions#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted to study residual effect of nutrient management(enriched compost, vermicompost and inorganic fertilizer) and crop (pearlmillet, sorghum and maize) on the soil fertility and yield of succeeding blackgram crop under dry land conditions. Effect of different crops on post harvest status of organic carbon and the availability of all the nutrients were found variable. The availability of all the nutrients were improved when crops were fertilized with enriched compost @ 6 t/ha as compared to other treatments. Beneficial effect of pearlmillet crop on yield attributes and yield of succeeding blackgram was recorded in comparison to sorghum and maize crops.#FRE#
