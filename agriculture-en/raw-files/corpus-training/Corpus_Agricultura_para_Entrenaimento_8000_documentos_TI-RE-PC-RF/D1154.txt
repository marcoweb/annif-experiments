#ITI#The role of photorespiration in preventing feedback regulation via ATP synthase in Nicotiana tabacum#FTI#
#IRE#Photorespiration consumes substantial amounts of energy in the forms of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reductant making the pathway an important component in leaf energetics. Because of this high reductant demand, photorespiration is proposed to act as a photoprotective electron sink. However, photorespiration consumes more ATP relative to reductant than the C3 cycle meaning increased flux disproportionally increases ATP demand relative to reductant. Here we explore how energetic consumption from photorespiration impacts the flexibility of the light reactions in nicotiana tabacum. Specifically, we demonstrate that decreased photosynthetic efficiency (ϕII) at low photorespiratory flux was related to feedback regulation at the chloroplast ATP synthase. Additionally, decreased ϕII at high photorespiratory flux resulted in the accumulation of photoinhibition at photosystem II centers. These results are contrary to the proposed role of photorespiration as a photoprotective electron sink. Instead, our results suggest a novel role of ATP consumption from photorespiration in maintaining ATP synthase activity, with implications for maintaining energy balance and preventing photodamage that will be critical for plant engineering strategies. © 2023 The Authors.
