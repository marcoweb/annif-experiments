#ITI#Effects of selenium hyperaccumulators on soil selenium distribution and vegetation properties#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: The ecological implications of hyperaccumulation have been investigated at the organismal level, but are poorly understood at the plant community level. Questions addressed here were: Does the presence of selenium (Se) hyperaccumulators affect Se distribution and concentration in their native soil, and do hyperaccumulators affect overall vegetation properties and species composition?. Methods: Plant survey and soil Se mapping were performed at three seleniferous sites in Colorado. In season one, plots with and without hyperaccumulators were compared for (1) bare ground, canopy cover, and species richness; (2) relative species abundance; (3) soil Se distribution and concentration. In season two, a smaller-scale design was implemented, focusing on areas 3 m in diameter around hyperaccumulators versus nonhyperaccumulators in 44 paired plots on one site. Results: Plots with hyperaccumulators generally showed more bare ground, less canopy cover, higher species richness, and 2–3-fold higher soil Se levels. These patterns were not consistently significant across all sites; the effects of hyperaccumulators may have been diluted by their low abundance and the relatively large area of survey. In the smaller-scale study, highly significant results were obtained, showing more bare ground, less canopy cover, and higher species richness in plots with hyperaccumulators; soil Se concentration was also higher in plots with hyperaccumulators. Conclusions: Hyperaccumulators may significantly affect local soil Se concentration and vegetation over at least a 3 m diameter area, or 4× their canopy. These differences may result from the combined positive and negative allelopathic effects observed earlier at the organismal level. © 2020 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
