#ITI#Waterlogging during the reproductive growth stage causes physiological and biochemical modifications in the leaves of cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) genotypes with contrasting tolerance#FTI#
#IRE#Waterlogging causes various metabolic, physiological, and morphological changes in crops, resulting in yield loss of most legumes in rainfed and irrigated agriculture. However, research on cowpea genotypes using physiological and biochemical traits as a measure of tolerance to waterlogging stress is limited. We evaluated the impacts of 7 days of waterlogging (DOW) and 7 days of recovery (DOR) on the physiology and biochemistry of two cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) genotypes (UCR 369 and EpicSelect.4) with contrasting waterlogging tolerance. Cowpea genotypes were grown in a controlled environment until the R2 stage and then subjected to 7 DOW. Later, the waterlogged plants were reoxygenated for an additional 7 DOR. Overall, cowpea genotypes had a contrasting response to waterlogging using different mechanisms. Compared to the control, the photosynthetic parameters of both cowpea genotypes were impaired under 7 DOW and could not recover at 7 DOR, with a larger decline in EpicSelect.4.7 DOW caused significant loss in the chlorophyll and carotenoid content of both genotypes. However, only waterlogged UCR 369 was not photo-inhibited and able to restore the levels of chlorophyll and carotenoids at 7 DOR. In addition, 7 DOW induced intense stress in UCR 369 with increased zeaxanthin, sucrose, and flavonoid content, while these metabolites were decreased in EpicSelect.4. On the other hand, glucose, fructose, and phenolic content were increased in EpicSelect.4 but decreased in UCR 369 at 7 DOR. In summary, compared to EpicSelect.4, UCR 369 restored their photosynthetic pigments and metabolites to the control levels at 7 DOR, indicating a likely tolerance to waterlogging stress. © 2022#FRE#
