#ITI#Effect of saline water irrigation and seed inoculation with rhizobium on nodulation and leghemoglobin content in fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-greacum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#The present study was undertaken to know the effects of salinity on nodulation and leghemoglobin content in two cultivars (NDM-17 and Pusa Kasauri) of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-greacum L.) treated with rhizobium. The pot experiments were conducted following completely randomized block design method. Two sets of pots were maintained with one set treated with rhizobium and other without. The sets were irrigated with saline water of different electrical conductivities (0.2, 3.2, 6.2, 7.2, 10.2, 12.2 and 14.2 dSm-1) created with NaCl, Na2SO4, NaHCO3 and CaCl2 salts. Observations on nodules number, weight and leghemoglobin content were recorded 30, 60, 90 and 120 days after sowing. The nodules growth decreased with increasing levels of salinity. Seeds treated with rhizobium ameliorated the deleterious effect of salinity at all levels besides improving the fertility of soil and growth of root nodules by nitrogen fixation. Present findings revealed that maximum number, weight and leghemoglobin content in cv. NDM-17 was higher as compared to cv. Pusa Kasauri in both treated and non-treated with rhizobium indicating it be the tolerant of the two cultivars. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
