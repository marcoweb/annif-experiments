#ITI#Stability analysis in pole type beans (P. vulgaris) under temperate conditions#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation was undertaken during 2012-2014 to generate information through evaluation of the set of materials (breeding material, germplasm lines and other varieties at the farmers’ field along with the farmers’ variety as a check through stability using Eberhart and Russel Model. Trials were laid at various locations of three districts summing to a three mother trials with one grand mother trial at the research station. The yield and yield attributing traits of all genotypes were taken on ten competitive plants of both grand mother and mother trial. The genotypes WB-83 and WB-258 were selected and preferred by the farmers across locations. The genotypes were evaluated for stability analysis and showed divergence across locations. The mean squares of all the traits were significant reflecting that the material was genetically divergent. The pooled deviation was significant and the variance due to variety × environment was significant for various traits indicating that the variation in the performance of the genotypes is both unpredictable and predictable. Most of the genotypes were having higher mean than the average, bi less than unity indicating that the varieties were more specifically adapted to the unfavorable environments than favourable ones. Some of the genotypes having higher mean yield, bi > 1 and S2di tending to zero were specifically adapted to favourable environments. On the basis of stability parameters genotypes WB-83 and WB-258 were identified as the most stable genotypes for seed yield per plot across all locations on the basis of high mean performance and non-significant estimates of bi and S2di from unit and zero respectively, however latter genotype showed sensitivity to better environments for biological yield on the basis of significant bi estimates. Similarly these genotypes were identified as consistent for early flowering for all the locations. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
