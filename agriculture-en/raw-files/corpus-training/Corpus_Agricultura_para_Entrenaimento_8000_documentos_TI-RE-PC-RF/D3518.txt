#ITI#Efficacy of fungicides and essential oils against bacterial diseases of fruit trees#FTI#
#IRE#In the framework of the performed studies, the antibacterial activity of the following fungicides was evaluated: Miedzian 50 WG (active substance - a.s. 50% copper oxychloride), Ridomil MZ Gold 68 WG (a.s. 3.8% metalaxyl-M and 64%, mancozeb), Euparen Multi 50 WG (a.s. 50% tolylfluanid), Captan 80 WG [a.s. 80% N-(captan)], Dithane Neotec 75 WG (a.s. 75% mancozeb). The evaluation also concerned the essential oils: lavender, sage, lemon balm, clove, and a preparation based on thyme oil (BioZell). Each preparation and compound was tested against the following bacterial pathogens: Erwinia amylovora, Xanthomonas arboricola pv. corylina, X. arboricola pv. juglandis, Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, Agrobacterium tumefaciens (presently Rhizobium radiobacter). Each preparation and compound was tested at a concentration of 1,000 ppm of active substance. Copper oxychloride was also tested at a concentration of 1,500 ppm. Among the tested fungicides, metalaxyl-M with mancozeb, mancozeb alone, and copper oxychloride inhibited all of the tested strains of pathogenic bacteria. Tolylfluanid did not inhibit any of the bacteria used. Out of the investigated essential oils, the strongest inhibitors of bacteria were: sage, cloves, and BioZell. The protective activity of the above mentioned fungicides was also evaluated in vivo. They were assessed against fire blight on apple blossoms and pear fruitlets, against bacterial canker on sweet cherry fruitlets, and against crown gall on sunflower seedlings (the test plant). All fungicides were applied at the same concentrations as those in the in vitro tests. Only copper oxychloride was found to show protective activity against the studied diseases. This result indicates that the antibacterial properties of the other fungicides did not correspond with their activity on the plant organs used in the in vivo experiment.#FRE#
