#ITI#Assessing temporal stability and spatial variability of soil water patterns with implications for precision water management#FTI#
#IRE#The temporal stability of soil water content patterns may have profound implications for precision agriculture in general and water management in particular. Spatio-temporal variability in soil water was assessed over four fields in a two-year potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) rotation to determine the potato yield implications and the potential for precision water management based on a stable spatial pattern of soil water. A hammer-driven time domain reflectometry probe was used to measure soil water content repeatedly along 10 transects. Irrigated, un-irrigated, and late irrigated treatments were employed. The temporally stable soil water pattern was mapped and compared with elevation and soil particle size classifications. A temporal stability model explained 47% of the observed variability in soil water content. An additional 20% of the variability was attributed to random measurement error. Calibrated in 2002, the model predicted water content (root mean square error of 0.05 m3 m-3) along transects in 2003 from a single measurement at the field edge. Field-scale trends and extended (>100 m) wet and dry segments were observed along transects. Coarser particle size class soils were generally drier. Potato yield increased linearly with water content in un-irrigated areas. Yield was comparatively high in the drier areas for the irrigated treatment but was highly variable and frequently poor in the wetter areas. For the late-irrigated treatment, a strong yield response to added water was evident in the dry areas; however, the yield response was neutral to negative in the wetter areas. Knowledge of the underlying stable soil water distribution could provide a useful basis for precision water management.#FRE#
