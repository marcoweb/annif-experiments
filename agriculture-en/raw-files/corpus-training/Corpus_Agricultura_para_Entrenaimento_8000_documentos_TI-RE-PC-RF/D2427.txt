#ITI#Yield and yield attributes as influenced by nutrient management practices in pigeonpea and clusterbean intercropping system#FTI#
#IRE#A filed experiment was conducted at College of Agriculture Farm, Gwalior on sandy clay loam soil during Kharif-2012 and 2013 to study the influence of nutrient management practices in pigeonpea and clusterbean intercropping system. On the basis of two year pooled data, results revealed that sole pigeonpea and clusterbean recorded significantly higher seed and stalk yield, harvest index, number of pods/plant, test weight, protein content, protein yield, dry matter/plant. Among the intercropping treatments T4(125% RDF to pigeonpea and no fertilizers to clusterbean) recorded significantly higher seed yield, stalk yield, harvest index, protein content, protein yield, yield attributes, pigeonpea equivalent yield and net return over other treatments except T3 and T5 which were onpar with T4 treatment. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
