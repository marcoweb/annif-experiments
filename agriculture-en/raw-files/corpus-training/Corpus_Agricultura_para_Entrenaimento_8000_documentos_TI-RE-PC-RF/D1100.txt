#ITI#The LaCLE35 peptide modifies rootlet density and length in cluster roots of white lupin#FTI#
#IRE#White lupin (lupinus albus L.) forms special bottlebrush-like root structures called cluster roots (CR) when phosphorus is low, to remobilise sparingly soluble phosphates in the soil. The molecular mechanisms that control the CR formation remain unknown. Root development in other plants is regulated by CLE (CLAVATA3/ EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION (ESR)-RELATED) peptides, which provide more precise control mechanisms than common phytohormones. This makes these peptides interesting candidates to be involved in CR formation, where fine tuning to environmental factors is required. In this study we present an analysis of CLE peptides in white lupin. The peptides LaCLE35 (RGVHyPSGANPLHN) and LaCLE55 (RRVHyPSCHyPDPLHN) reduced root growth and altered CR in hydroponically cultured white lupins. We demonstrate that rootlet density and rootlet length were locally, but not systemically, impaired by exogenously applied CLE35. The peptide was identified in the xylem sap. The inhibitory effect of CLE35 on root growth was attributed to arrested cell elongation in root tips. Taken together, CLE peptides affect both rootlet density and rootlet length, which are two critical factors for CR formation, and may be involved in fine tuning this peculiar root structure that is present in a few crops and many Proteaceae species, under low phosphorus availability. © 2024 The Authors.
