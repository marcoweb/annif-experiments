#ITI#Enhancing bioactive compounds accumulation in red beet (Beta Vulgaris L.) plants by managing N nutrition. The identification of the ‘critical’ zone as a cultivation technique#FTI#
#IRE#The increasing interest in natural health-promoting compounds, which are mostly plant secondary metabolites, inspired attempts to stimulate mechanisms strengthening their bioaccumulation in crop plants via abiotic stress while maintaining the yield potential. This study investigates the long-term effects of limiting nitrogen (N) supply on the concentration of total phenolics, free radical activity of natural antioxidants, betacyanin content, biomass production, net photosynthetic rate, total chlorophyll content, and plant water relations in red beetroot plants (Beta vulgaris L.) grown hydroponically. Depending on fertilization, the range of N supply for evaporative demand comprises two contrasted nutrient zones, in which N is limiting (zone-1) or non-limiting (zone-2). Based on the carbon-nutrient-balance hypothesis, at the transition from 1st-zone to 2nd-zone, there is a narrow transition zone in which the plant nutrient status is considered ‘critical’. Herein, to determine the ‘critical’ zone, a modified Michaelis-Menten (M-M) model was used using a piecewise linear regression on two indexes: net photosynthetic rates and free radical-scavenging capacity of phenolic antioxidants. The model showed that the ‘critical’ transition points of net photosynthetic rate and phenolic free radical content are located in a narrow zone ranging between 196.70 ± 8.75 and 271.54 ± 75.50 ppm NO3−, while the cropping season appears to affect slightly the range of ‘critical’ (transition) zone. Thus, supplying N to red beetroot plants to levels ranging within this ‘critical’ zone may be an efficient, profitable and sustainable way to increase the accumulation of health-promoting plant bioactive compounds (total phenolic compounds with radical activity and betacyanins) in hydroponically cultivated reed beetroot plants. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
