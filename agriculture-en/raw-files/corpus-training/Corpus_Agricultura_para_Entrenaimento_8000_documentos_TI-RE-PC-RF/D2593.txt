#ITI#Effect of Moisture Conservation Practices on Growth and Yield of Pearlmillet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend Stuntz] Hybrids#FTI#
#IRE#Background: A field experiment was conducted under loamy sand soil during two consecutive kharif seasons of 2018 and 2019 at Agronomy farm, S.K.N. College of Agriculture, Jobner, Jaipur to find out the best moisture conservation practices on growth and yield of pearlmillet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. emend Stuntz] hybrids. Methods: Hybrids viz., RHB-173, RHB-177, MPMH-17 and HHB-67 in main plots and moisture conservation practices viz., control, dust mulch, straw mulch, plastic mulch and seed line mulching of FYM in sub plots were tested using split plot design replicated four. Result: The results further indicated that hybrid RHB-173 being at par with RHB-177 significantly higher plant height, dry matter accumulation, yield attributes, grain yield (2097 kg/ha), stover yield (5500 kg/ha) and biological yield (7597 kg/ha) over MPMH-17 and HHB-67. Result showed that application of plastic mulch recorded significantly increased the plant height, dry matter accumulation, yield attributes, grain yield (2145 kg/ha), stover yield (5620 kg/ha) and biological yield (7764 kg/ha) compared to other moisture conservation practices in both the years of experimentation as well as on pooled basis.
