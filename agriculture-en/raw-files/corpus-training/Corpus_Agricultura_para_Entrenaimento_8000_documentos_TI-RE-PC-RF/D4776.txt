#ITI#Seroprevalence of avian reovirus in egg-laying chicken flocks in China#FTI#
#IRE#In the present study, the epidemiologic status of avian reovirus (ARV) infections was investigated from egg-laying chicken flocks in China with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. Because the chickens were not vaccinated against ARV, antibodies were attributed to the infection. Antibodies specific to ARV were found in more than 92% (542/587) of the average positivity and ranged from 30% to 100% in different chicken population. A virus, designated HB06, was isolated from flocks with suspicious ARV infections. Sequence analysis of the S1 gene revealed that strain HB06 was closely related with the most ARVs with less than 2% nucleotide divergence, and the homology was highest with the vaccine strain S1133, with a 98.97% nucleotide identity. The potential significance of vaccination against ARV in egg-laying chicken flocks in China is also discussed.#FRE#
