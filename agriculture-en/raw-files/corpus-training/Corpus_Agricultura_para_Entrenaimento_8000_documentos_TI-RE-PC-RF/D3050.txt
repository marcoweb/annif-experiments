#ITI#Metal uptake by psyllium (Plantago ovata L.) treated with lead (Pb) under semi-arid conditions#FTI#
#IRE#Psyllium plants were treated with different doses of lead (Pb) and different plant parts and seeds were analyzed. Iron (Fe) contents were found to be lower than the toxic level (Soil 2396.9, seeds 691.5, roots 1516.6, leaves 1384.5, husks 1226.1µmol kg-1 DW). The leaf Zn contents were above the critical level but lower than the toxic level (295.2 ± 16 µmol kg-1). Leaf manganese (Mn) and Cr levels in P. ovata plants fell within the critical range (232.6 and 0.1923 µmol kg-1 respectively). Lead in soil significantly correlated with Fe and Mn, but non-significantly with Zn and Cr in plants of P. ovata. The transfer ratios of Cr and Zn in plants without Pb treatment were lower as compared to plants treated with varying levels of Pb. P. ovata can grow in soils having lead concentration up to 4000 µmol and act as a hyper accumulator of lead. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
