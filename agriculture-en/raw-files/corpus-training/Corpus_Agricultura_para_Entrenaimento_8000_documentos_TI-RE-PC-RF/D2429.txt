#ITI#Thermal energy utilization in mungbean (Vigna radiata l.) as influenced by sowing times and genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiment was conducted to study the thermal energy utilization in mungbean as influenced by sowing times and genotypes during Kharif season of 2014 and 2016 at Research farm of CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, India. Experiment was laid out in split plot design with four main-plot treatments of sowing times (2nd fortnight of June, 1st fortnight of July, 2nd fortnight of July and 1st fortnight of August) and four sub-plot treatments comprised of genotypes (MH 421, Basanti, Sattya and MH 318). The results indicated that yield and yield attributes, phenology, agro-meteorological indices (GDD, HTV, HYTV, PTU and PAR) and yield based thermal energy use efficiencies (HUE, HTUE, HYTUE, PTUE and RUE) were significantly influenced by sowing times and genotypes. Early sowing (2nd fortnight of June) of mungbean was found more suitable and recorded significantly higher yield and thermal energy use efficiencies. Among the genotypes MH 318 was recorded with maximum thermal use efficiencies followed by MH 421. Â© 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
