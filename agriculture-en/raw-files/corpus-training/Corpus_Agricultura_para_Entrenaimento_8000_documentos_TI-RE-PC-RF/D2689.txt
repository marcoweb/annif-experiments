#ITI#Morphological and ultra-structural characterization of blackgram [vigna mungo (L.) hepper] genotypes grown under high temperature stress#FTI#
#IRE#Background: In this decade, increasing temperatures and adverse environmental factors are expected to influence the crop yield, seed quality and germination ability. Prolonged heat stress affects the pod setting, seed morphology and alters the starch granules. Methods: In this study, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Light microscope was used to investigate the variations of morphological and ultra-structural characteristics in blackgram genotypes grown under high temperature (38+2°C) stress (HTS). Nineteen blackgram genotypes were evaluated under open top temperature controlled chamber (OTC) and the genotypes were classified into three categories such as heat tolerant, moderately heat tolerant and heat susceptible genotypes based on the Temperature Induction Response (TIR) and yield reduction percentage under HTS. Two genotypes were selected and examined the seed size, surface pattern, starch granule size and hilum from the each category. Result: Seed coat morphology was captured using SEM and light microscope showed that the tolerant genotype VBG-07-001 had a clear shiny surface, thin and reduced cotyledon fissures, compact surface devoid of surface deposits and pits whereas rest of the genotypes (VBG-06-001, VBN-6, CoBg-11-02, CoBg-11-03 and VBG-08-003) had a rough surface. A bold and well-structured starch granule was observed in heat tolerant lines whereas, unstructured and pleated granules were observed in moderately tolerant and heat stress lines. These morphological and ultra-structural studies revealed remarked diversity among different genotypes that can be regarded as useful to screen the genotypic tolerant characters for HTS. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
