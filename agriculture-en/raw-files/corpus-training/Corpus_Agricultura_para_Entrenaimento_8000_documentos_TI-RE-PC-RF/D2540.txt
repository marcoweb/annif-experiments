#ITI#Residual Effect of Weed Management Practices Executed in Preceding Maize on Succeeding Greengram#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Maize followed by summer pulses is the emerging cropping system in many places in India. Herbicides are the efficient tools for checking weed infestation and their usage is increasing throughout the globe due to increased labour cost and quick weed control. Some herbicides do not degrade quickly and may remain in the soil for weeks, months or years after application and may inhibit the growth of succeeding crops. Methods: Field experiment was conducted in a randomized block design (RBD) during rabi and summer seasons of 2017-18 and 2018-19 to know the residual effect of different herbicides applied in maize on succeeding greengram. Result: The present study revealed that lower density and dry weight of total weeds and higher yield attributes and yield was recorded with the practice of adopting two hand weedings at 15 and 30 DAS, which was however, at par with atrazine 1.0 kg ha-1 as PE fb one HW at 30 DAS, atrazine 1.0 kg ha-1 as PE fb topramezone 30 g ha-1 as PoE and atrazine 1.0 kg ha-1 as PE fb tembotrione 120 g ha-1 as PoE, without any significant disparity among them. Herbicides applied in maize did not alter statistically the enzyme activity and microbial count in the soil at harvest of succeeding greeengram. Â© 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
