#ITI#Seed growth and seed quality in Dipogon Lignosus (L.) Verdc. bean#FTI#
#IRE#Lignosus (Dipogon lignosus) is valued for green seeds and young twigs as vegetable, dry split seeds as pulse soup and other plant parts as organic matter. Two field experiments were conducted and seed growth stages were investigated to determine physiological maturity (PM), time of harvest of green seeds for vegetable and to assess quality and protein content of seeds in Lignosus bean. Four consecutive stages of seed growth/maturity viz., prePM, PM, postPM and harvest maturity (HM) were considered. Effect of four seed growth stages on seed germination, seedling growth and protein content were investigated. Maximum seed fresh and dry weight (PM) was observed 40 days after flowering (DAF). PM to HM stages showed higher germination (> 80%) than PrePM (35.34%). Seed protein content was higher at postPM and HM (average of 23.61%) than in the others. It may be concluded that green seeds attained PM (40 DAF) with good seed protein content (21.2%) in Lignosus bean.#FRE#
