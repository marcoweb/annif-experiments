#ITI#Nitrous oxide emissions from a fertilized and grazed grassland in the South East of Ireland#FTI#
#IRE#Agriculture currently accounts for 28% of national greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural soils account for 38% of this total. A 2-year study was conducted, using the chamber technique on a fertilized and grazed grassland to quantify the effect of fertilizer application rate, soil and meteorological variables on N2O emissions. Three N fertilizer regimes (0, 225 & 390 kg N ha-1) were imposed with three replicates of each treatment. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied as urea (46% N) in spring with calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN-26% N) applied in the summer (June-September). Rotational grazing was practiced using steers. Nitrous oxide emissions arising from the unfertilized plots (0 N) were consistently low. Emissions from the N-fertilized plots (225 & 390 kg N ha-1) were concentrated in relatively short periods (1-2 weeks) following fertilizer applications and grazing, with marked differences between treatments, relative patterns and magnitudes of emissions at different times of the year and between years. Variation in N2O emissions throughout both years was pronounced with mean coefficients of variation of 116% in year 1 and 101% in year 2. The study encompassed two climatologically contrasting years. As a result the N2O-N loss, as a percent of the N applied in the cooler and wetter 2002 (0.2-2.0%), were similar to those used for N-fertilized grasslands under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) N2O emission inventory calculation methodology (1.25% ± 1). In contrast, the percentage losses in the warmer and drier 2003 (3.5-7.2%) were substantially higher. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.#FRE#
