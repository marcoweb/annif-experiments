#IRE#The efficacy and economics of different IGR’s, insecticides and bio-rational against Spodoptera litura (Fabr.) in soybean, revealed that at three days after first and second sprays the rynaxypyr (64.52%) and emamectin benzoate (58.84% reduction) respectively proved to be the most effective. At seven days more percent reduction in larval population found in chlorpyriphos (53.76 %) and quinalphos (58.59%) where as at 14 days the diflubenzuron (59.72%) and quinalphos (53.42%) found to be the more effective after first and second sprays respectively. Significantly higher seed yield was recorded in rynaxypyr 20 SC followed by spinosad 45SC. The highest gross income and net profit was recorded in rynaxypyr 20 SC. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
