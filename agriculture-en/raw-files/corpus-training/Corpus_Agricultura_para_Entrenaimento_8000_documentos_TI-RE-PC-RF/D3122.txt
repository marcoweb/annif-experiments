#IRE#                             An effective and durable genetic resistance in black gram genotypes against powdery mildew provides a cost effective and reliable strategy to reduce the yield losses and save quality of the harvest. The identification of potential resistant source(s) is the most crucial step in disease resistance breeding. In the present study, out of 116 genotypes screened, genotype LBG-645 recorded lowest per cent disease severity of 0.77 and was found to be highly resistant to powdery mildew under green house condition. Under in vitro condition also, LBG-645 which was found to be highly resistant with 3.33×10                             3                              conidia colony, 0.94 per cent of leaf area covered by powdery mildew and 1.00 colony per leaflet was recorded. Hence, resistant genotype LBG-645 must be used in further breeding programme for the development of resistant varieties of black gram against powdery mildew.                          © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
