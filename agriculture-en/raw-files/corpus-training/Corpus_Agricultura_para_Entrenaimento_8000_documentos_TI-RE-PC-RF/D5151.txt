#ITI#Development of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for duck enteritis virus DNA#FTI#
#IRE#Duck enteritis virus (DEV) is a herpesvirus that causes an acute, contagious, and fatal disease. In the present article, we introduce a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for DEV DNA using TaqMan technology and a two-step protocol. It was confirmed to be rapid, sensitive, and specific for DEV detection. The primers and probe were designed and directed to the DNA polymerase gene of DEV. The method will provide a valuable tool for rapid laboratory diagnosis of DEV infection. By virtue of its high-throughput format and its ability to accurately quantify the viral DNA, the method may be useful for large epidemiological surveys and clarification of pathogenesis, such as latency and reactivation of the virus.#FRE#
