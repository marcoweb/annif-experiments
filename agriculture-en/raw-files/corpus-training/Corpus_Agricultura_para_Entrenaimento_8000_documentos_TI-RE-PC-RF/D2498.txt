#IRE#Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) are the most widely symbiosis in terrestrial ecosystem. Leaf N and P are the most important plant functional traits due to their influence on biogeochemical cycling. However, as the notable nitrogen (N) fixing plants, the variations of leaf N, P and N:P and their relationship among mycorrhizal types had been hardly studied based on functional groups. In this study, we studied the leaf N, P and N:P and their relationship between AM and other mycorrhizal types (others) among different functional groups or climate zones. The results indicated that AM improve significantly leaf N and P, while reduce N:P comparing to others. However, the influences of AM and others on leaf N, P and N:P changed with plant functional groups or climate zone. The relationships between leaf N and P, between N and N:P and between P and N:P also exhibit great variation between AM and Others. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
