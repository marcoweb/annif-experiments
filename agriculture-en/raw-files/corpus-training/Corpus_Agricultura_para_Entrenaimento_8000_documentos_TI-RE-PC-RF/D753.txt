#ITI#Berry secondary metabolites and leaf physiological parameters are independently regulated by exogenous methyl jasmonate application in Sangiovese grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.)#FTI#
#IRE#The role of jasmonates as elicitor of secondary metabolites is well known, and many experiments have been conducted in grapevine to evaluate their effects on berry and wine quality. Even though most of these studies used foliar jasmonates applications, little investigations have been done to assess the effects on leaves which, in turn, may indirectly affect grape metabolism potentially involving a long distance signaling or crosstalk. In this experiment we jointly investigated the specific effect of jasmonates on grape berry secondary metabolites and leaf physiological parameters to better comprehend their elicitation mechanisms in grapevine. A 10 mM methyl jasmonate (MeJA) solution was applied during the lag-phase only on the leaves or only on the clusters and compared to an untreated control. The MeJA specifically affected leaf physiological parameters and berry metabolism in the treated area. When applied only on the leaves, gas exchange parameters and leaf efficiency were reduced, stimulating the senescence mechanisms, without affecting berry metabolism. On the contrary, MeJA applied on the clusters significantly delayed berry ripening, leading to hypothesize a re-route of the berry carbon resources through the biosynthesis of volatile organic compounds which were strongly increased, especially the monoterpenes in their glycosylated form. © 2024 The Authors#FRE#
