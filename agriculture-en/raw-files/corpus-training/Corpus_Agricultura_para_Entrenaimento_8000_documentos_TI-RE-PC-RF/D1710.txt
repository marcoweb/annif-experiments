#IRE#Liquid hog manure (LHM) is a valuable source of nutrients for farm production. Long-term experimental plots that had received LHM applications of 0, 50, and 100 m3 ha-1 annually for 20 years were analyzed for total soil C, N and P storage. Applications increased total soil N and P by 1,200 kg N ha-1 and 850 kg P ha-1 at 100 m-3 LHM year-1, compared to the control treatment. However, C storage did not increase with LHM rates and was lower in the 50 m3 ha-1 LHM treatment (86 Mg C ha-1) than in the 0 or 100 m3 ha-1 treatments (100 Mg C ha-1). In addition to the limited quantities and high decomposability of the C supplied by LHM, it is hypothesized that LHM stimulated the mineralization of both native soil C and fresh root-derived material. This priming effect was particularly apparent in deeper soil horizons where the decomposability of native C may be limited by the supply of fresh C. This study indicates that while LHM can be a significant source of crop nutrients, it has limited capacity for maintaining or increasing soil C. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
