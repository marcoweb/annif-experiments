#ITI#Effect of spacing and fertilizer level on yield attributes of dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata)#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted at Central Farm Unit situated in Agricultural College and Research Institute, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Killikulam during Rabi 2011-12 to evaluate the effect of spacing (120×30cm, 120×20 cm, 90×30 cm and 90×20 cm) and fertilizer levels (12.5:25:12.5, 18.75:37.5:18.75, 25:50:25, 31.25:62.5:31.25 kg N, P2O5, K2O/ha and control) on yield attributes of Dhaincha. The results revealed that spacing adopted with 120×30 cm significantly recorded higher number of pods/plant (53.7), pod length (19.94 cm), number of seeds/pod (28.52) and seed yield (585 kg/ ha) of Dhaincha. In respect of different fertilizer levels, application NPK @ 31.25:62.5:31.25 kg/ha perceived higher yield attributes (number of pods/plant (48.8), pod length (17.98), number of seeds/ pod (29.28) and seed yield (609 kg/ha). Combination of spacing (120×30 cm) with fertilizer levels of 31.25:62.5:31.25 kg/ha significantly recorded higher seed yield of 705 kg/ha. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
