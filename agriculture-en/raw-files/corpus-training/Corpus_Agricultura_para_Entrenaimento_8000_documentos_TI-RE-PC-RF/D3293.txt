#ITI#Response of Cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp] Genotypes under Residual Moisture Condition in Rice-FallowArea of Goa State, India#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during rabi season 2018-19 to study the response of 23 cowpea genotypes grown under residual moisture condition in rice-fallow situation of Goa state. Analysis of variance revealed significant differences among the genotypes for all the eleven characters, justifying the selection of genotypes for the study. The estimate of phenotypic coefficient of variation (PCV) and genotypic coefficient of variation (GCV) were high (>20%) for seed yield, straw yield, pods per plant and 100 seed weight. Heritability and genetic advance as per cent mean estimates were high for most of the characters except for days to 50 per cent flowering, days to maturity and plant height. Characters plant height, pods per plant, straw yield and harvest index showed positive and significant association with seed yield. Path analysis based on seed yield, as a dependent variable, revealed that straw yield and harvest index had the highest positive direct effect on seed yield. Therefore, maximum importance should be given to these traits during the selection for achieving the higher seed yield under rice-fallow situation. Three promising genotypes identified from this study viz., PCP-1131, SKAU-C-407 and RC 101 would serve as dual-purpose cowpea under rice-fallow areas due to their high seed yield and straw yield.
