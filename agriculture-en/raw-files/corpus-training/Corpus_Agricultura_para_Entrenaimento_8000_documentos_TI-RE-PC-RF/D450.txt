#ITI#Effects of exogenous calcium on growth, chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics and antioxidant system of Fraxinus malacophylla seedlings#FTI#
#IRE#Karst ecosystems are becoming increasingly problematic, and high calcium is one of the main characteristics of soils in rocky desertification areas. Chlorophyll fluorescence is one of the most important indicators of the extent to which plants are affected by their environment. There are few reports on the effects of changes in exogenous calcium levels on the chlorophyll fluorescence properties of Fraxinus malacophylla seedlings. In the present study, we investigated the growth, chlorophyll fluorescence properties and antioxidant system of Fraxinus malacophylla seedlings in response to exogenous calcium (as the concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 75 mmol L−1). The results showed that Ca2+ concentration (25–50 mmol L−1) treatment mainly promoted the growth, biomass accumulation, root activity, and chlorophyll synthesis and effect on chlorophyll fluorescence in Fraxinus malacophylla; the developed root system became a strong linking hub for calcium adaptation. In addition, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) are upregulated and play an important role in preventing excessive oxidative damage. OJIP test parameters changed significantly with the addition of exogenous calcium, and parameters related to each photosystem II (PSII) reaction centre, such as ABS/RC and DIo/RC, increased significantly in the OJIP test, with enhanced function of the PSII electron donor lateral oxygen evolution complex. In conclusion, the addition of exogenous calcium (25–50 mmol L−1) had an important protective effect on the photosynthetic mechanism of Fraxinus malacophylla, promoting photosynthesis, better growth and better adaptability. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
