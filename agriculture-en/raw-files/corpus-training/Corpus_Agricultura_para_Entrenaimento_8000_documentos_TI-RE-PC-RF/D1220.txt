#ITI#Nitrophosphates and DAP are equally effective as P fertilizers for various crop species grown in rotation on a Typic Haplustept#FTI#
#IRE#In two long-term field experiments using wheat-maize and potato-sunflower-pearl millet (fodder) cropping systems on Typic Haplustept loamy sand, three different water-soluble P fertilizers [diammonium phosphate (DAP, water-soluble phosphorus content (WSPC) of 89.1%), ammonium nitrophosphate (ANP, WSPC 59%) and suphala (ammonium nitrophosphate, WSPC 26.7%)] were compared. Five amounts of P (0, 8.75, 17.5, 26 and 35 kg P/ha) were applied to wheat and (0, 13, 26, 39 and 52 kg P/ha) to potato. The succeeding crops under both the rotations used residual P from the P applied to wheat and potato crops. Grain yield and P content of wheat increased significantly up to an applied P level of 26 kg P/ha while the residual effect on maize crop was significant up to 17.5 kg P/ha. Tuber yield and P content of potato increased significantly up to an applied P level of 39 kg P/ha while the residual effect on sunflower and pearl millet (fodder) crops was significant up to 26 kg P/ha. Total profits in a year from wheat-maize and potato-sunflower- pearl millet (fodder) cropping systems increased significantly up to an applied P level of 26 and 39 kg P/ha, respectively. However, at all the levels of applied P and under both the cropping systems, the three P fertilizers used were found to be equally effective for plant yields, P contents, relative agronomic efficiencies and total profits in a year. Hence, it was concluded that the two nitrophosphates can be used instead of DAP as P fertilizers for the soil, plant species and crop rotations studied.#FRE#
