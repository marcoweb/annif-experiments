#ITI#Optimization of polyamine and mycorrhiza in sorghum plant for removal of hazardous cadmium#FTI#
#IRE#Eco-friendly and sustainable practices must be followed while using the right plants and microbes to remove harmful heavy metals from the soil. The goal of the current study was to ascertain how effectively sorghum plants removed cadmium (Cd) from the soil using polyamines and mycorrhiza. Plant-biochemicals such as free amino acids, ascorbic acids, anthocyanin, proline, and catalase, APX, peroxidase activities were considered as markers in this study which revealed the adverse plant growth performance under 70 and 150 ppm of Cd concentration (w/w) after 30,60, and 90 days of treatment. The plants showed a mitigating effect against high Cd-concentration with exogenous use of mycorrhiza and putrescine. The treatment T17 (mycorrhiza +5 mM putrescine) showed a substantial decrease in the content of total free amino acid, ascorbic acid, catalase, APX, peroxidase by 228.36%, 39.79%, 59.06%, 182.79% 106.97%, respectively after 90 days as compared to T12 (150 ppm Cd). Anthocyanin content was negatively correlated (−0.503, −0.556, and −0.613) at p < 0.01 with other studied markers, with an increase by 10.52% in T17 treated plant as compared to T12. The concentration of Cd in root increased by 49.6% (141 ppm) and decreased in the shoot by 71% (17.8 ppm) in T17 treated plant as compared to T12 after 90 days. The application of mycorrhiza and putrescine significantly increased BCF (>1) and decreased TF (<1) for Cd translocation. The administration of mycorrhiza and putrescine boosted the Cd removal efficiency of sorghum plants, according to FTIR, XRD, and DSC analysis. As a result, this study demonstrates novel approaches for induced phytoremediation activity of plants via mycorrhiza and putrescine augmentation, which can be a promising option for efficient bioremediation in contaminated sites. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
