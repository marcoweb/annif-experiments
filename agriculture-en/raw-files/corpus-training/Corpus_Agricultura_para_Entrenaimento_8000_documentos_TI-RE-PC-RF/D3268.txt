#ITI#Effect of Plant Growth Promoting Bacillus spp. on Germination and Seedling Growth of Soybean#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Bacillus spp., known to promote growth and reduce disease of various field and vegetable crops, are frequently found in soils. The objective of the study was to select effective Bacillus spp. isolates with multiple plant growth properties and antifungal activities and to examine their effect on germination of soybean. Methods: Bacterial isolates were screened for production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and siderophores and solubilization of phosphate. The ability of bacterial isolates to inhibit the growth of seven phytopathogenic fungi affecting soybean was determined using a dual plate assay. Bacillus spp. were further selected and examined in a seed germination test. Result: All Bacillus spp. isolates were positive for IAA production, while siderophore production and P-solubilization were observed in 80% and 20% bacterial isolates, respectively. Bacillus spp. exhibited the highest antifungal activity against Diaporthe caulivora, followed by Diaporthe sojae, Diaporthe eres, Diaporthe longicolla and Macrophomina phaseolina and the least antagonistic effect toward Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium subglutinans. Selected isolates of B. subtilis significantly affected final germination, shoot length, root length, shoot dry weight and root dry weight of two soybean cultivars. The most effective Bacillus spp. isolates could be used as potential inoculants for improving soybean productivity. Â© 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
