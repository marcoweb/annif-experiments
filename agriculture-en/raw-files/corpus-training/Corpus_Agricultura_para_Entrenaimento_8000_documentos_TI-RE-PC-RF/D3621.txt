#ITI#Insecticidal activities of essential oils from some cultivated aromatic plants against spodoptera littoralis (Boisd)#FTI#
#IRE#Medicinal plant species were tested for their fumigant activity against Spodoptera littoralis third instar larvae. Responses varied according to plant species and parts used. For the present investigation, volatile oils were obtained from: Foeniculum vulgare (flowers and seeds), Coriandrum sativum (seeds), Daucus carota (flowers), Pelargonium graveolens (leaves and flowers), Origanum majorana (leaves and flowers), and Salvia officinalis (leaves). Fumigant activity was observed after 24 hours of exposure. All essential oils were proved to be toxic to the third instar larvae. However, the highest mortality was observed in the essential oil of S. officinalis leaves, C. sativum seeds, F. vulgare seeds, D. carota flowers, and O. majorana leaves with LC50 = 23.050 μl/l air, 68.925 μl/l air, 95.075 μl/l air, 99.300 μl/l air, and 100.925 μl/l air, respectively. Other oils showed an LC50 between 101 and 183 μl/l air.#FRE#
