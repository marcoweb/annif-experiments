#ITI#Detection of antibodies to egg drop syndrome virus in chicken serum using a field-based immunofiltration (flow-through) test#FTI#
#IRE#A simple, user-friendly, and rapid method to detect the presence of antibodies to egg drop syndrome 76 (EDS) virus in chicken sera based on an immunofiltration (flow-through) test was developed. Purified EDS virus antigen was coated onto nitrocellulose membranes housed in a plastic module with layers of absorbent filter pads underneath. Following addition of serum to be tested and washing, monoclonal antibodies or polyclonal serum to chicken immunoglobulin G (IgG) was used as a bridge antibody to mediate binding between EDS virus-specific IgG and protein A gold conjugate. The appearance of a pink dot indicated the presence of antibodies to EDS virus in the sample tested. The results could be obtained within 5-10 min. The developed immunofiltration test could detect antibodies in the sera of experimentally vaccinated chickens from 2 wk postvaccination. With field sera samples, this test was positive in samples having hemagglutination inhibition titers of 8 and above. This test has the potential to be used as a field-based kit to assess seroconversion in EDS-vaccinated flocks.#FRE#
