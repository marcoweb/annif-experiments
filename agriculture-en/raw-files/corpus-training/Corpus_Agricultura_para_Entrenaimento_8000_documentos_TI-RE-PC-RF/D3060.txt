#ITI#Characterization of rhizobia from root nodule and rhizosphere of Vicia faba in Algeria#FTI#
#IRE#Nitrogen fixation resulting from mutual symbiosis of rhizobia and cultivated legume plants is therefore critical to food security as it directly affects agricultural production. Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF) can be an important factor in sustainable agriculture. A collection of 20 isolates from fresh Nodules of the legume plant Vicia faba was isolated from five soil of Algeria. The soil from each region has undergone physical-chemical analysis: (granulometry, total carbon, organic matter, pH, and electrical conductivity, determination of available phosphorus and determination of total nitrogen). A media viz., Glucose-Peptone Agar (GPA), Congo red, Yeast Mannitol Agar (YMA) containing 2% NaCl were employed to make presumptive decisions on the recognition and classification of the isolated bacterial strains. All the isolates were found with poor absorption of dye Congo red and little or no growth on the media of GPA and without altering the pH. Almost all of the isolates exhibit good growth on 2% NaCl, poor growth on GPA, thus confirming the rhizobia. After biochemical tests like catalase test and citrate utilization test isolates were confirmed. The presence of rhizobia on root nodules of leguminous plant.
