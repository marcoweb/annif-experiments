#ITI#Effects of drip irrigation frequency on soil wetting pattern and potato growth in North China Plain#FTI#
#IRE#The effect of irrigation frequency on soil water distribution, potato root distribution, potato tuber yield and water use efficiency was studied in 2001 and 2002 field experiments. Treatments consisted of six different drip irrigation frequencies: N1 (once every day), N2 (once every 2 days), N3 (once every 3 days), N4 (once every 4 days), N6 (once every 6 days) and N8 (once every 8 days), with total drip irrigation water equal for the different frequencies. The results indicated that drip irrigation frequency did affect soil water distribution, depending on potato growing stage, soil depth and distance from the emitter. Under treatment N1, soil matric potential (ψm) Variations at depths of 70 and 90 cm showed a larger wetted soil range than was initially expected. Potato root growth was also affected by drip irrigation frequency to some extent: the higher the frequency, the higher was the root length density (RLD) in 0-60 cm soil layer and the lower was the root length density (RWD) in 0-10 cm soil layer. On the other hand, potato roots were not limited in wetted soil volume even when the crop was irrigated at the highest frequency. High frequency irrigation enhanced potato tuber growth and water use efficiency (WUE). Reducing irrigation frequency from N1 to N8 resulted in significant yield reductions by 33.4 and 29.1% in 2001 and 2002, respectively. For total ET, little difference was found among the different irrigation frequency treatments. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
