#ITI#Effect of reniform nematode, rotylenchulus reniformis as biotic inducer of resistance against root-knot nematode, meloidogyne incognita in potato#FTI#
#IRE#A greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate the preinoculation of reniform nematode, Rotylenchulus reniformis for inducing resistance against Meloidogyne incognita in potato plants. Potato plants were inoculated with reniform nematode three days before the same plants received a root knot nematode inoculation. There was a reduction in the population parameters of the root knot nematode compared to plants given only a single inoculation. The studied potato plants which had two inoculations, also had enhanced growth parameters. The activity of the enzymes; peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and chitinase increased in the inoculated plants compared to the non-inoculated control.#FRE#
