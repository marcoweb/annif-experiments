#ITI#Evapotranspiration and crop coefficient for sprinkler-irrigated cotton crop in Apodi Plateau semiarid lands of Brazil#FTI#
#IRE#During the twentieth century, the cotton crop was the main agricultural product in the semiarid regions of Brazil, with over 3.2 million hectares planted. However, due to structural problems, this activity became uncompetitive and economically unfeasible, being virtually wiped out in the eighties. The revival of cotton growing in semiarid lands of Brazil is important to the regional economy. However, the adoptions of new technologies mainly related to the water use efficiency are needed. Thus, accurate ETc estimates are required for efficient irrigation management. The K c method is a practical and reliable technique for estimating ETc, and has been vastly applied by the farmers in the semiarid lands of Brazil. However, the use of K c values listed in FAO-56 can contribute to ETc estimates that are substantially different from actual ETc. Hence the importance of determining K c values experimentally. A field study on sprinkler-irrigated cotton was carried out during the dry seasons of 2008 and 2009 years in the Apodi Plateau, Brazilian semiarid lands. This study aims to determine ETc and the K c curve values using the Bowen Ratio Energy Balance (BREB) technique. The locally developed K c curves are compared with generalized FAO K c values adjusted for local climate and management. The ETc values were 716mm and 754mm in 2008 and 2009, respectively. These values were higher than those observed in other areas of Brazilian semiarid. These differences are attributed to weather heterogeneity in the region. The average of K c values were 0.75, 1.09 and 0.80 for initial, middle and end, of growing season, respectively. These values were lower than the K c-FAO-Adjusted to local conditions. For this reason, ETc values obtained from K c-FAO-Adjusted were overestimated by 12% in both the years. The irrigation scheduling based on the K c-FAO-Adjusted increases production cost and yield loss. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..#FRE#
