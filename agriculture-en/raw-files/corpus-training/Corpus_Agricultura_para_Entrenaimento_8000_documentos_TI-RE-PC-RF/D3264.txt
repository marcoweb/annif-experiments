#ITI#Influence of seed inoculation treatments on yield and quality of green gram (Vigna radiata L.)#FTI#
#IRE#To study the effect of seed inoculation treatments with biological agents on seed germination, field emergence and its effect on seed during summer season. Seeds of green gram variety Pratap (SG-1) were treated with microbial formulations of seven treatments which consisted of-Rhizobium (T1), Trichoderma harzianum (T2), Trichoderma viride (T3), Bacillus megaterium (T4), Trichoderma harzianum + Trichoderma viride + Bacillus megaterium (T5), Rhizobium + Trichoderma harzianum + Trichoderma viride + Bacillus megaterium (T6) and Control (T7). Shoot length, root length and seedling dry weight were recorded after 20 days of sowing, observations on nodulation, yield and yield contributing characters were recorded at maturity and germination characteristics of the seeds were studied in the laboratory. It was observed that seeds treated with combined inoculation of Rhizobium @ 4 g + Bacillus megaterium @ 5ml/1000 ml of water + Trichoderma harzianum @ 5ml/1000 ml of water + Trichoderma viride @ 5ml/1000 ml of water (T6) recorded significantly higher field emergence (91.25%), speed of emergence (42.14), seedling dry weight (1.67mg), shoot length (25.48 cm), seed yield (992 kg ha-1), Stover yield (1870 kg ha-1), number of pods plant-1 (37), number of seeds pod-1 (13.25), 100 seed weight (3.63g) root length (9.22 cm) and nodulation (15).
