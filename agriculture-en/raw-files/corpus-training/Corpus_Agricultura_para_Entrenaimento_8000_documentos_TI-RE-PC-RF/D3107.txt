#ITI#Nutrient uptake and yield of Kharif green gram as influenced by levels of sulphur, phosphorus and PSB inoculation#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was conducted to study the response of kharif green gram [(Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek)] to various levels of sulphur, phosphorus and PSB inoculation. Sulphur and phosphorus were applied at three levels (0, 20 and 40 kg/ha), with and without phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) inoculation and the experiment was laid out in factorial randomized block design (FRBD) with four replications. Results reveal that of higher doses phosphorus (40 kg/ha) recorded significantly maximum number of branches/plant (4.48), plant height at harvest (46.57 cm), plant spread (34.15), number of nodules/ plant (16.66), stover yield/ha (2197.55 kg) while 40 kg/ha sulphur application recorded highest dry matter/plant (9.27 g), number of pods/plant (18.00), length of pod (7.30 cm), seed yield/ha (1486.08 kg). Nutrient uptake is also discussed where higher doses of P, S and PSB inoculation significantly affected the uptake of nutrients by seed and stover over control.
