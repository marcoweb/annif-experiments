#ITI#Alteration in β-1, 3 glucanase and chitinase activity in chickpea varieties infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri race 4#FTI#
#IRE#Alterations in β-1,3 glucanase and chitinase activity during host-pathogen interaction were studied in chickpea varieties JCP 27 (resistant) and JG 62 (susceptible) to vascular wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri race 4. The enzyme activities were analyzed in root, stem and leaf tissues at three stages viz., pre-infection, infection and post-infection in normal and inoculated soil. The β-1,3 glucanase activity in root, stem and leaf tissues of susceptible variety found higher than those of resistant one at all the stages of infection under inoculated condition.. The chitinase activity in root and leaf tissues of susceptible variety was higher than the resistant variety at all infection stages in inoculated soil, whereas in stem tissue the activity level was higher in resistant variety at pre-infection and infection stages. Overall result revealed that β-1,3 glucanase showed higher induction with increase in inoculums pressure of the fungal pathogen, whereas hydrolytic enzyme chitinase was induced only when inoculum pressure of the fungal pathogen was severe. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
