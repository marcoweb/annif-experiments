#ITI#Isolation and characterization of a 6/85-like mycoplasma gallisepticum from commercial laying hens#FTI#
#IRE#Eighty-three-week-old table egg layers with swollen sinuses were presented with a history of increased mortality. Serology revealed positive titers to Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG). The birds were part of a flock in which some birds had been vaccinated with 6/85 live MG vaccine at 18 wk of age. Tracheal cultures were obtained from both vaccinated and unvaccinated birds within the flock. The cultures were indistinguishable from 6/85 vaccine by both random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis and DNA sequence analysis. Challenge studies were performed to compare the field isolates with 6/85 vaccine and the R strain of MG. The field isolates produced a greater antibody response by serum plate agglutination than did the 6/85 vaccine. The isolates effectively colonized the trachea without increasing the tracheal mucosal thickness; however, they did not extensively colonize the air sacs or cause airsacculitis in the experimental birds.#FRE#
