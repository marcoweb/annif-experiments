#ITI#Response of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) to balanced fertilization under Sub-Humid Southern Plain Zone of Rajasthan#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted on sandy clay loam soil during two kharif seasons of 2008 to 2009 to study the response of groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) to balanced fertilization. The experiment, comprised of 3 balanced fertilization treatments i.e. 100 % NPK, 100 % NPKS and 100 % NPKSZn, was laid out in randomised block design with 9 replications. Results revealed that application of 100 % NPKSZn significantly enhanced the pod and haulm yields of groundnut by 25.9 and 22.4 per cent over 100 % NPK, respectively. This treatment also recorded significantly higher concentration and uptake of N, P, K, S and Zn as well as improved the soil fertility status.#FRE#
