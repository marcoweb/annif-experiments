#ITI#Seed Hardening in Relation to Seedling Quality Characters of Green Gram (Vigna radiata L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Green gram is a drought resistant crop requires low inputs. The productivity of mung bean is very low. Initial germination, growth and vigour are some major reasons of low productivity. The present investigation was carried out to study the effect of seed hardening on morpho-physiological and seedling quality characters in green gram. Methods: The green gram var. GAM-5 was imposed with seed hardening treatments viz., 2% CaCl2, 500 ppm Cycocel, 1000 ppm Cycocel, 25 ppm NAA, 50 ppm NAA, water soaked control and absolute control. The treated seeds along with control were evaluated for their seedling quality characters under laboratory conditions. Result: The study reported that seeds hardened with CaCl2 @ 2% recorded higher germination per cent, root, shoot and seedling length, fresh weight, turgor weight, dry weight and seed vigour index I and II. Seed hardened with 50 ppm NAA reported higher root dry weight and root to shoot ratio on dry weight basis while Cycocel 1000 ppm treatment recorded higher root to shoot ratio on length basis. The treatments CaCl2 2% followed by Cycocel 1000 ppm were found to be superior as compared to other treatments and control on the basis of lab studies.
