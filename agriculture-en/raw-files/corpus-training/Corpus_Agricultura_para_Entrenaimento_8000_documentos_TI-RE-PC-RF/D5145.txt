#ITI#Ulcerative enteritis (quail disease) in lories#FTI#
#IRE#Ulcerative enteritis is found in a wide range of avian hosts but has not been described in psittacine birds. This case report describes ulcerative enteritis in four lories (two Trichoglossus sp. and two Eos sp.) that were found dead without any previous sign of disease. Macroscopically, all four birds showed good body condition. The only remarkable finding was a moderate dilatation of the small intestine with the presence of multiple yellow foci. Histologically, multiple ulcers extended into the submucosa and were filled with necrotic debris; bacteria and fibrin were observed in the intestinal mucosa. The liver and spleen exhibited a multifocal fibrinoid necrosis associated with a very moderate inflammatory reaction. Microbiological isolation revealed colonies of Clostridium colinum and Clostridium perfringens in die intestinal tract of the investigated birds.#FRE#
