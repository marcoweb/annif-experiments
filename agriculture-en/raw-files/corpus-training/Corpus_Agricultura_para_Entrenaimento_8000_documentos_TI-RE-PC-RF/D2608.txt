#ITI#Cross transferability of chickpea genic ssr markers developed from fusarium wilt resistance loci to orphan legumes#FTI#
#IRE#The availability of genomic resources in orphan legumes is limited for molecular research because of the high cost involved in development of SSR marker pool. In this study, 162 genic SSR markers derived from Fusarium wilt resistant genomic loci of chickpea were tested for cross-genera transferability across nine other legumes viz., cowpea, horse gram, black gram, pigeon pea, dolichos, rice bean, winged bean, soya bean and moth bean. Nineteen markers of chickpea amplified the genomic DNA of all other legumes indicating the sequence conserved across the genera. However, the markers exhibiting the cross-genera transferability is ranging from 24.40 to 32.14%. The observed cross-genera transferability was highest in the cowpea (32.14%), reflected in the closer relationship with chickpea followed by rice bean (31.55%). The least transferability was reported in moth bean (24.40%). These transferable genic SSR markers will serve as a valuable tool in genomic research of orphan legumes.
