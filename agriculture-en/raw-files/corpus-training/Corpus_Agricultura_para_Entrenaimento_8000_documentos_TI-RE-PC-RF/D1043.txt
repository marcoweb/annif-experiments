#ITI#MicroRNA397 regulates tolerance to drought and fungal infection by regulating lignin deposition in chickpea root#FTI#
#IRE#Plants deposit lignin in the secondary cell wall as a common response to drought and pathogen attacks. Cell wall localised multicopper oxidase family enzymes LACCASES (LACs) catalyse the formation of monolignol radicals and facilitate lignin formation. We show an upregulation of the expression of several LAC genes and a downregulation of microRNA397 (CamiR397) in response to natural drought in chickpea roots. CamiR397 was found to target LAC4 and LAC17L out of twenty annotated LACs in chickpea. CamiR397 and its target genes are expressed in the root. Overexpression of CamiR397 reduced expression of LAC4 and LAC17L and lignin deposition in chickpea root xylem causing reduction in xylem wall thickness. Downregulation of CamiR397 activity by expressing a short tandem target mimic (STTM397) construct increased root lignin deposition in chickpea. CamiR397-overexpressing and STTM397 chickpea lines showed sensitivity and tolerance, respectively, towards natural drought. Infection with a fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, responsible for dry root rot (DRR) disease in chickpea, induced local lignin deposition and LAC gene expression. CamiR397-overexpressing and STTM397 chickpea lines showed more sensitivity and tolerance, respectively, to DRR. Our results demonstrated the regulatory role of CamiR397 in root lignification during drought and DRR in an agriculturally important crop chickpea. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
