#ITI#Synchronizing N supply from soil and fertilizer and N demand of winter wheat by an improved Nmin method#FTI#
#IRE#Excessive nitrogen (N) fertilizer application and poor timing of N fertilizer application to winter wheat are common problems on the North China Plain. To study the possibilities of optimizing the timing and rate of N application, a field experiment was conducted from 1999 to 2001 in a suburb of Beijing. A control (no nitrogen) and two N fertilization strategies (conventional N application and optimized N fertilization) were designed to compare their effects on wheat growth, N nutrient status, grain yield and N balance. The conventional N fertilization strategy was given a fixed N rate of 300 kg N ha-1, which was split, half in autumn and half in spring as a top-dressing. The timing and rate of N and application of the optimized N fertilization strategy were determined by the target value of soil mineral nitrogen demand for three growth periods of wheat, which is related to the target yield, and soil mineral N (Nmin) in the effective rooting depth at the beginning of these three periods. Based on the optimized N fertilization strategy, a total of 55 and 65 kg N ha-1 had to be applied to winter wheat in the re-greening and shooting stages of the first and second experimental years, respectively. Compared with the high N rate before sowing in the conventional N fertilization treatment, the optimized N fertilization treatment did not require any N fertilizer before sowing of wheat. Despite a much lower N fertilization rate, no significant difference in N nutrient status, growth during the wheat growing period or grain yield was observed between optimized N and conventional N fertilization treatments. As a consequence of optimizing the rate and timing of the N fertilizer application to match wheat demand, a much lower residual Nmin and calculated apparent N loss was found as compared to the conventional N treatment. N recovery for the optimized N fertilization treatment (67% in 1999/2000 and 66% in 2000/2001) was much higher than that of the conventional N fertilization treatment (19% in 1999/2000 and 18% in 2000/2001). In conclusion, the optimized N fertilization strategy can synchronize N demand of wheat and the N supply from soil and fertilizer, and therefore drastically reduce N application rates without any yield losses.
