#ITI#Effect of organic seed pelleting on biometric, biophysical and yield parameters of clusterbean under saline condition#FTI#
#IRE#Cluster bean is one of the major legumes cultivated in many parts of the world. However effect of organic seed pelleting in this crops needs more attention nowadays in probem soils like saline soil. Field experiments were carried out with cluster bean cv. Pusa Mausami to study the effect of organic seed pelleting on biometric, biophysical and yield parameters of clusterbean under saline condition. The seeds of cluster bean cv. Pusa Mausami were pelleted with pungam, prosopis, notchi, arappu leaf powders @ 50, 100, 150 and 200 g per kg. From the results, it was found that seed pelleting with pungam leaf powder @ 200 g per kg registered significantly higher values for biometric parameters viz., plant height, number of branches per plant, dry matter production, biophysical parameters viz., photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration and yield parameters viz., pod length, number of pods per plant, pod yield per plant, number of seeds per pod, seed yield per plant and hundred seed weight. From the present study, it was concluded that seed pelleting with pungamn leaf powder @ 200 g per kg can be recommended for increased growth and yield parameters in cluster bean under saline conditions.
