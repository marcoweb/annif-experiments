#ITI#Invasive plant species that experience lower herbivory pressure may evolve lower diversities of chemical defense compounds in the exotic range#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Invasive plant species often escape from specialist herbivores and are more likely to be attacked by generalist herbivores in the exotic range. Consequently, the shifting defense hypothesis predicts that invasive plants will produce higher concentrations of qualitative defense compounds to deter dominant generalist herbivores in the exotic range. Here, I additionally propose a reduced chemical diversity hypothesis (RCDH), which predicts that reduced herbivory pressure will select for invasive plant genotypes that produce lower diversities of chemical defense compounds in the exotic range. Methods: I tested whether (1) invasive Brassica nigra populations express a lower diversity and an overall higher concentration of glucosinolate compounds than native-range B. nigra; (2) Brassica nigra individuals that express high diversities and concentrations of glucosinolate compounds are more attractive to specialist and deterrent to generalist herbivores; and (3) tissues of invasive B. nigra are less palatable than tissues of native-range B. nigra to the generalist herbivores Theba pisana and Helix aspersa. Results: Invasive B. nigra populations produced a significantly lower diversity of glucosinolate compounds, a marginally higher concentration of total glucosinolates, and a significantly higher concentration of sinigrin (the dominant glucosinolate). Leaf tissues of invasive B. nigra were significantly less palatable to T. pisana and marginally less so to H. aspersa. Brassica nigra individuals that expressed high concentrations of total glucosinolate compounds were visited by a low diversity of generalist herbivore species in the field. Conclusions: In line with the RCDH, the lower diversity of glucosinolate compounds produced by invasive B. nigra populations likely resulted from selection imposed by reduced herbivory pressure in the exotic range. © 2022 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
