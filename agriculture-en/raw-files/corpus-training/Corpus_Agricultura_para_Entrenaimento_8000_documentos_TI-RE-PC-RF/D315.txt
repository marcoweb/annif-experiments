#ITI#Investigation of phenological, primary and secondary metabolites changes during flower developmental of Rosa damascena#FTI#
#IRE#Oil-bearing rose is a very valuable member of the Rosa genus. Despite the importance of oil-bearing rose, metabolic changes during flower development are not well understood. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the changes in phenological, primary and secondary metabolites and their interactions at five developmental stages of oil-bearing rose. Flower width, flower and petal fresh weights, petal area and petal relative water content increased from bud stage to blooming stage, while flower length and sepal area increased only at early stages. Thirty-seven essential oil components were identified at different stages of petal development and nonadecane, β-citronellol and n-heneicosane were the prevalent essential oil components regardless of stage. Sixteen fatty acids were identified and the amount of saturated fatty acids was higher than the mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids in all developmental stages. Eight organic acids were detected in petals and four of them (tartaric, malic, citric and succinic acids) showed significant changes, and total organic acids content decreased during flower development. Catechin and epicatechin were the most abundant phenolic compounds in petals. While total phenolic, flavonoid and free amino acids contents decreased during flower development, total free fatty acids content increased, but was not significant between the developmental stages. Correlation analysis between phenological traits and some metablolites revealed 20 significant correlations and 11 of which were positive. Results showed that flower development stages had significant effects on metabolite content and quality of products obtained, and significant shifts in metabolite type and content occurred at flower development stages III and IV. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
