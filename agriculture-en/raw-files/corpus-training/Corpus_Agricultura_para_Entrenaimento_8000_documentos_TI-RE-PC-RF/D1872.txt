#ITI#Squash yield, nutrient content and soil fertility parameters in response to methods of fertilizer application and rates of nitrogen fertigation#FTI#
#IRE#Two field experiments were conducted to evaluate squash yield and nutrient content in response to different fertigation nitrogen (N) rates and method of fertilizer N application. The following treatments were studied in a randomized complete block design with four replications: zero N (N0), 50 (N1), 100 (N2) and 150 (N3) mg l-3 N concentration in the irrigation water (IW) (fertigation treatments) and a soil application treatment (NS) equivalent to the N2 treatment. Irrigation was applied to replenish 80% of the Class A pan evaporation twice a week. Compared to the control (N0), shoot dry matter and yield were increased by all fertigation N rates and by the soil application treatment. However, soil application gave a lower yield than the equivalent fertigation N rate, indicating the comparative advantage of fertigation. The lowest fertigation N rate was adequate to give the highest yield in the first season, while in the second season a higher rate was necessary to achieve the maximum yield. The growth and fruit yield were higher in the second season as a result of the more favorable climatic conditions. Regression relationships indicate that the yield and the shoot dry weight were related to the fertigation N rates by polynomial quadratic relationships. The response to N in the second season was greater, as indicated by the steeper positive slope. The fruit yield was linearly related to both fruit number and fruit size in both seasons. N contents in shoots increased with N addition and were higher in both fruit and shoot during fruiting with the fertigation method. Soil salinity slightly increased with N application, especially in the top 15 cm, but remained low and acceptable for normal plant growth. Soil P increased mainly in the top soil following phosphoric acid application to all plots. Restricted P movement to deeper soil is attributed to the expected precipitation and/or sorption reactions with Ca and Mg in calcareous soils. It can be concluded that fertigation is more effective than soil application in increasing the yield and with fertigation lower N rates would be adequate to produce higher yield, thus lowering fertilization cost and minimizing environmental impact of over-fertilization.#FRE#
