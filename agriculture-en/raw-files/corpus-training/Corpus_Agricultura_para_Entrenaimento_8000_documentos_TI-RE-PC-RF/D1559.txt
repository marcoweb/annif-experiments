#ITI#Nutrient recycling potential of rock phosphate and waste mica enriched compost on crop productivity and changes in soil fertility under potato-soybean cropping sequence in an Inceptisol of Indo-Gangetic Plains of India#FTI#
#IRE#This manuscript focuses on the nutrient recycling potential of enriched compost prepared using rice straw, low-grade rock phosphate (RP) and waste mica along with Aspergillus awamori and their effect on crop productivity and changes in soil fertility under potato-soybean cropping sequence in an Inceptisol of Indo-Gangetic Plains of India. Enriched composts had higher total as well as bioavailable P and K content than ordinary compost. Data emanated from the field study revealed that yield and uptake of N, P and K by potato tubers were significantly increased due to application of inorganic fertilizer and enriched compost over control. Application of 50% recommended dose of NPK fertilizers (RDF) along with 4.0 Mg ha-1 of enriched compost product-C prepared by rice straw + RP @ 4% P + waste mica 4% K + Aspergillus awamori resulted in 43.3% additional yield and 102.3, 67.0 and 62.2% additional N, P and K uptake by potato over control, respectively. Significant increase in yield and uptake of N, P and K by soybean grown on residual fertility were also observed over control. Post-harvest soil analysis indicated a significant build-up in soil organic C, available N, P and K due to application of enriched compost in combination with inorganic fertilizer over 100% RDF. The results clearly showed that enriched compost could be an alternative and cost effective option to prepare a value added product using agricultural wastes and low-grade minerals like RP and waste mica in place of costly chemical fertilizer for crop production and maintaining soil fertility.
