#ITI#Divergence analysis of black gram (Vigna mungo L.) for grain yield and yield components#FTI#
#IRE#Thirty-two black gram genotypes were evaluated using twelve quantitative and fifteen qualitative traits at Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology (MNNIT), Allahabad, India to determine genetic divergence using important yield and yield contributing traits. The number of pods plant-1, peduncle length, harvest index and biomass yield plant-1 are important traits affecting grain yield response in black gram. The quantitative traits like; pod length, number of pods plant-1, 100-grain weight as well as qualitative traits like; stem pubescence, leaf pubescence, pod pubescence, pre mature pod colour and plant growth habit which have major contribution in the genetic divergence of black gram. The number of pods plant-1 is most important grain yield contributing and genetic divergence developing traits. The genotypes were classified into six clusters based on Euclidean distance. The genotypes belonging to cluster I, II and III were highly diverse than genotypes lies in cluster IV, V and VI. The genotypes IPU 99-176, UH 82-51, GE 154, IPU 99-3 and NG 2119 had good potential to develop high yielding transgressive segregants. The wide genetic diversity is present in black gram. The present study will be much helpful for selection of the parental lines to develop good grain yield producing black gram cultivar in accordance with changing climate. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
