#ITI#Drought priming induced thermotolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during reproductive stage; a multifaceted tolerance approach against terminal heat stress#FTI#
#IRE#In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), terminal heat stress obstructs reproductive functioning eventually leading to yield loss. Drought priming during the vegetative stage can trigger a quicker and effective defense response against impending high temperature stress and improve crop production. In the present study, two contrasting wheat cultivars (PBW670 and C306) were subjected to moderate drought stress of 50–55% ﬁeld capacity for eight days during the jointing stage to generate drought priming (DP) response. Fifteen days after anthesis heat stress (36 °C) was imposed for three days and physiological response of primed, and non-primed plants was assessed by analyzing membrane damage, water status and antioxidative enzymes. Heat shock transcription factors (14 TaHSFs), calmodulin (TaCaM5), antioxidative genes (TaSOD, TaPOX), polyamine biosynthesis genes and glutathione biosynthesis genes were analyzed. GC-MS based untargeted metabolite profiling was carried out to underpin the associated metabolic changes. Yield related parameters were recorded at maturity to finally assess the priming response. Heat stress response was visible from day one of exposure in terms of membrane damage and elevated antioxidative enzymes activity. DP reduced the impact of heat stress by lowering the membrane damage (ELI, MDA & LOX) and enhancing antioxidative enzyme activity except APX in both the cultivars. Drought priming upregulated the expression of HSFs, calmodulin, antioxidative genes, polyamines, and the glutathione biosynthesis genes. Drought priming altered key amino acids, carbohydrate, and fatty acid metabolism in PBW670 but also promoted thermotolerance in C306. Overall, DP provided a multifaceted approach against heat stress and positive association with yield. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
