#ITI#Automatically selecting hot and cold pixels for satellite actual evapotranspiration estimation under different topographic and climatic conditions#FTI#
#IRE#The persistent monitoring of evapotranspiration (ET) over the regions suffering from water scarcity is critical for sustainable agricultural water management. Remote sensing provides time- and cost-effective capability to investigate daily ET rates at large scales. Satellite-based actual evapotranspiration (ETa) algorithms typically rely on specifying the upper and lower boundaries of ETa rate over agricultural and pasture fields, commonly known as hot (dry) and cold (wet) pixels selection. These boundaries are to be recognized by an expert through a subjective and labor-intensive task. In this study, a method has been introduced to automatically select appropriate anchor pixels (i.e., hot and cold pixels) independent from land use/cover maps with the simplest possible way, quickly applied even by an inexperienced operator. Subsequently, ETa was calculated using Mapping EvapoTranspiration at high Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), and Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) algorithms and evaluated against measured data. In this method, the mountains and foothills were removed using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and the subsequent product was a slope mask. Then, filters were applied based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Albedo, and Land Surface Temperature (LST) images to identify potential candidate pixels for hot and cold pixels. In the end, the best-conditioned pixel being closest to the meteorological station was selected. The method was assessed in five different regions with different topographic and climatic conditions. The selected pixels were first visually validated in Landsat images, and then the fluctuations and values were discussed in time series of anchor pixels and LST histograms. The visual interpretation was indicative of selecting the anchor pixels in fallow (hot pixel) and densely vegetated (cold pixel) surfaces. Also, the hot and cold pixels were suitably situated in the upper and lower quartiles of the LST histogram, respectively. The range of cold pixels variations throughout the study periods was lower compared with the hot pixels (44.2, 55.3, 35.5, 66.5, and 25.2 K for hot pixels against 34.2, 45.7, 25.6, 52.2, and 17 K for cold pixels) as expected, which emanated from the lower fluctuations of temperature over vegetation against the soil. The results were indicative of the better performance of METRIC compared with SEBAL and SEBS with greater values of R2 in all the regions. Therefore, using the introduced method, the expert subjective interference was eliminated and processing time reduced significantly from about 1 h per image to a few minutes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
