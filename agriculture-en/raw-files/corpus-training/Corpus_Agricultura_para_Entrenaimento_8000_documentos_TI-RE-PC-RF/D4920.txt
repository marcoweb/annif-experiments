#ITI#Evaluation of the effectiveness of two infectious bronchitis virus vaccine programs for preventing disease caused by a California IBV field isolate#FTI#
#IRE#Infectious bronchitis virus CA99 serotype was isolated from several broiler flocks in Northern California. The virus caused late-onset respiratory disease and increased airsacculitis condemnation in affected flocks despite the use of an established infectious bronchitis virus vaccination program. An experimental study compared Holland/Arkansas and Massachusetts/ Arkansas vaccination protocols to determine the efficacy of commercial infectious bronchitis virus vaccines in reducing respiratory disease and airsacculitis lesions found at processing that were associated with a CA99 field isolate. All vaccination groups were given Massachusetts/Connecticut strains of infectious bronchitis virus vaccines at age 1 day followed by vaccination with either Holland/ Arkansas or Massachusetts/Arkansas vaccine strains at 18 days of age. Birds were challenged at age 31 days with a CA99 field isolate. Gross pathology, histopathology, and virus isolation were evaluated. Chickens vaccinated with Holland/Arkansas had marginally better protection against CA99 challenge than chickens vaccinated with Massachusetts/Arkansas, although differences were not statistically significant.#FRE#
