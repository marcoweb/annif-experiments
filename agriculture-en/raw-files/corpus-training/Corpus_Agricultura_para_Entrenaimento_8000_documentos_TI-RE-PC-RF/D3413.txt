#ITI#Non-chemical control of some important pests of sweet cherry#FTI#
#IRE#Some non-chemical insecticides were tested for efficacy of control of fall webworm, Hyphantria cunea (Drury), and of cherry weevil, Rhynchites auratus (Scop.) in the laboratory and black cherry aphid, Myzus cerasi (Fabr.) under field conditions. Hendreson & Tilton formula was applied for evaluation of efficacy. NeemAzal T/S (azadirahtin) at the concentration 0.5% and Naturalis (Beauveria bassiana) used at 0.2% or 0.3% have shown the best results against black cherry aphid. Good results were also obtained with Pyrethrum FS (pyrethrin + sesame oil + soft potassium soap) used at 0.05% or 0.1%, with NeemAzal T/S at 0.3%, PreFeRal WG (Paecilomyces fumosoroseus) at 0.2% and with Naturalis at 0.1%. The effect of PreFeRal WG, applied at 0.1% was unsatisfactory. Against the fourth instar larvae of fall webworm, excellent results were noted for Pyrethrum (0.05% and 0.1%) and Naturalis (0.1% and 0.2%). Very good effects were also obtained with the BMP 123WP (Bacillus thuringiensis), used in concentration of 0.1%. NeemAzal T/S - 0.5% had still good, albeit lower, efficacy. Against the cherry weevil only Pyrethrum FS was tested. This insecticide resulted in a very good efficacy, when used at the concentration 0.1% and still satisfactory - at 0.05%. Â© 2008, Versita.
