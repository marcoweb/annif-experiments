#ITI#Comparative investigation of prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella between pasture and conventionally reared poultry#FTI#
#IRE#The objective of this study was to compare Salmonella prevalence and antimicrobial resistance between pasture and conventional poultry farms. We collected the first Salmonella prevalence and antimicrobial resistance data on pasture poultry farms. Fecal droppings were collected from 31 farms from Wisconsin (nine farms from each production type) and the Southeast (North Carolina, Virginia, and South Carolina; five conventional and 10 pasture poultry farms) in a 1-yr period. The specimens were cultured for Salmonella and tested for resistance to 12 antimicrobials. A univariate analysis was conducted to determine the significant differences in prevalence and resistance. At the farm level, no significant difference in Salmonella prevalence was found on 33% pasture and 47% conventional poultry farms (P = 0.4928). On an individual specimen level, flocks reared conventionally had higher prevalence than in pasture (P < 0.0001). Of all the isolates found to have resistance, 80% were from the Southeast. Of all the pasture isolates tested, 5% (8 of 162) were resistant to ceftriaxone, which is higher than previously reported from any production setting. None of the isolates from conventional flocks showed resistance to ceftriaxone. Multidrug resistance (resistance to three or more classes of antimicrobials) was found in 69% of the isolates from conventional farms and 11% on pasture farms in the Southeast (P < 0.0001), with the predominant resistance type of AmCSSuTeAx (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfasoxazole, tetracycline, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid; 62%). About 5% of the pasture isolates from the Southeast showed the AmAxCFCRO (ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, ceftriaxone) multidrug resistance pattern. None of the isolates from Wisconsin were found to be multidrug resistant.#FRE#
