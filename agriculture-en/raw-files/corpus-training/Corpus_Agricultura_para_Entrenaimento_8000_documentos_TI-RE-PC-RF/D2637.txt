#ITI#Correlation of Pests Resistance Levels and Seed Chemical Concentrations of Soybean Genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Pests and diseases infestations reduce the quantity and quality of seed yields. The objective of this study was to identify the correlation value between level of resistance to pests and chemical (fat and protein) concentrations of soybean genotypes. Methods: A total of 15 soybean genotypes were planted in field and glass house environments in 2017. Observations were made on the infestation intensity of pest and disease, dry seed yield, yield components and chemical (fat and protein) concentrations. Result: Soybean genotype DG-91-8 showed resistant (R) category to pod borer and pod sucker, while DM-122-35-17 showed resistant (R) category to army worm and pod borer. Two highest yielding genotypes (DG-91-8 and DG-99-32-14) had 15% higher seed yield than check variety Dering 1 (2.41 t/ha), with higher 100 seeds weight and pod number/plant. Fat concentration showed a significant positive correlation value with leaf rust disease. Pod suckers showed a significant positive correlation value with pod borer infestation, indicating that they had the same preference for soybean pods. Soybean genotypes DG-91-8 showed high seed yield (2.70 t/ha) and resistant (R) level to pod borer and pod sucker. Â© 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
