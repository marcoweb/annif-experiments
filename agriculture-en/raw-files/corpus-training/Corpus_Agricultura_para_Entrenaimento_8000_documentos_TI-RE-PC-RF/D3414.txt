#ITI#Changes in cellular immune responses of Chilo suppressalis Walker (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) due to pyriproxyfen treatment#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of pyriproxyfen were determined on the cellular immunity and phenoloxidase activity in the 4th instar larvae of Chilo suppressalis Walker. The bioassay results revealed the effective concentrations of: 10L: 18C, 30L: 72C and 50L: 190C μg·ml-1. The sole effect of 18 and 72 μg·ml-1 concentrations at intervals of 1-3 h caused a higher number of total hemocytes in the treated larvae than the control, but the reverse results were observed after 6-24 h. The number of plasmatocytes was lower than that of the control for intervals of 3-24 h but the number of granulocytes was higher than the control after 1-3 h although no significant differences were observed at the other times. In the treated larvae, the activities of phenoloxidase were higher and lower than those of the control after 1-3 h and 6-24 h, respectively. The combined effects of pyriproxyfen and the entomopathogenic fungus, Beauveria bassiana isolate B3 caused higher numbers of total hemocytes, plasmatocytes, and granulocytes in the treated larvae by use of the three concentrations of pyriproxyfen, at intervals of 6 and 12 h. Although the numbers of nodules in the larvae treated with concentrations of 18 μg·ml-1 were higher than those of other treatments, the overall numbers were lower than those of the control. Finally, the activity of phenoloxidase in the treated larvae was higher than that of the control, at intervals of 6 and 12 h post-treatment. Findings of the current study indicate an intervening role of pyriproxyfen in the cellular immunity of C. suppressalis to entomopathogenic objects. © Seyyedeh Kimia Mirhaghparast et al. 2015.#FRE#
