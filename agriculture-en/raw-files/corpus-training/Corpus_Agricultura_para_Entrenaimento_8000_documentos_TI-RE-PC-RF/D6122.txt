#ITI#LACK OF DIVERGENCE IN SEED ECOLOGY OF TWO AMPHICARPAEA (FABACEAE) SPECIES DISJUNCT BETWEEN EASTERN ASIA AND EASTERN NORTH AMERICA#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the study: Many congeneric species are disjunct between eastern Asia and eastern North America. No previous study has compared the seed biology of closely related disjunct taxa of legumes or of a diaspore-heteromorphic species. Our objective was to compare seed dormancy in two such sister species in the genus Amphicarpaea (Fabaceae). • Methods: We investigated the ecology and ecophysiology of aerial and subterranean seeds of the amphicarpic species Amphi-carpaea edgeworthii from China and compared the results to those published for its sister species A. bracteata from eastern North America. • Key results: The seed coat of aerial seeds of A. edgeworthii is well developed, whereas the seed coat of subterranean seeds is not. Aerial seeds have combinational dormancy (physical dormancy [PY] + physiological dormancy [PD]) broken by scarifica-tion followed by cold stratification or by after-ripening and scarification; whereas subterranean seeds have PD broken by cold stratification. Aerial seeds formed a persistent soil seed bank, and subterranean seeds a transient soil seed bank. Aerial seeds of A. bracteata also have PY+PD and subterranean seeds PD. Subterranean seeds of both species are desiccation intolerant. • Conclusion: Dormancy in neither aerial nor subterranean seeds of both species has diverged over geological time. Compared to subterranean seeds, aerial seeds of both species dispersed over longer distances. Seed dispersal ability and degree of dormancy of neither species fits the high-risk/low-risk (H-H/L-L) strategy found in many diaspore-dimorphic species. Rather, both species have an H-L/L-H strategy for these two life history traits. © 2015, John Wiley and Sons Inc. All rights reserved.#FRE#
