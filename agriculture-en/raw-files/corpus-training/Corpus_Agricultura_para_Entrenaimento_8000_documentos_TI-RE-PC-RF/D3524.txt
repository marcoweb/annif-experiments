#ITI#Pathogenicity of meloidogyne incognita race 1 on tomato as influenced by different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and bioformulated paecilomyces lilacinus in a dysteric cambisol soil#FTI#
#IRE#A greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate the single and combined effects of different arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and bioformulated Paecilomyces lilacinus against M. incognita race 1 on tomato. Dysteric Cambisol soil was used. The experiment took place in Calabar, Cross River State, Nigeria. The experiment was laid out as a 3 ×6 factorial in a completely randomized design (CRD) with three replications. Three applications of the bionematicide were combined with five species of AMF plus an uninoculated control. The results indicated that AMF species differed significantly (p ≤ 0.05) in their efficacy of gall and egg mass inhibition, tomato root colonization rate as well as growth and fresh fruit yield enhancement. Glomus etunicatum and G. deserticola were the most efficient species. Two applications of the bionematicide more significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced galling and egg production than a single application. Individual combinations of two AMF (G. etunicatum and G. deserticola) with a double application of the bionematicide, resulted in the greatest gall and egg mass inhibition and consequently the greatest growth and fresh fruit yield enhancement.#FRE#
