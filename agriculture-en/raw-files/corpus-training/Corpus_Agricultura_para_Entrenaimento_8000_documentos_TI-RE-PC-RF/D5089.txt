#IRE#In this study, a Chinese field strain of subgroup J avian leukosis virus (ALV-J), NX0101, was studied for its immunosuppressive effects in both commercial broilers and SPF white Leghorn chickens infected at 1 day of age. Our data demonstrated that NX0101 induced much more significant body and immune organ weight loss in the infected commercial broiler chickens in an earlier age than that in the SPF white Leghorn chickens. At the same time antibody responses to vaccinations of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and infectious bursa disease virus (IBDV) in the NX0101-infected chickens were also evaluated and compared between the commercial broiler chickens and the SPF white Leghorn chickens. Compared with the control group of chickens, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody response to NDV vaccines was significantly reduced in the NX0101-infected commercial broiler chickens from as early as 20 days after vaccination. However, no significant difference in HI antibody response was seen when HI titers reached their peaks in the NX0101-inoculated and control SPF white Leghorn chickens, except it declined significandy faster in infected birds. Neither of these two types of chickens showed significant decrease of antibody response to IBDV vaccination. Herein, we conclude that this NX0101 strain of ALV-J could selectively suppress humoral immune reactions to NDV, especially in broilers. But challenge experiments were not conducted and, therefore, it cannot be known if decreased antibody levels correlated with decreased protection against NDV in this case.#FRE#
