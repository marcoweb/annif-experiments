#ITI#Effect of density of Tephrosia candida stands on soil characteristics#FTI#
#IRE#With one-year-old Tephrosia candida trees as experimental material, influence of stand density on soil nutrient content and enzyme activity was studied. The results showed that density had little influenced on pH value in 2, 4 and 8 trees m2 stands. The contents of soil organic matter, effective nitrogen and effective phosphorus significantly increased in 2 trees m2 stands. The contents of soil organic matter and effective nitrogen significantly increased, whereas total N, total P, total K, effective N, effective P and effective K significantly decreased in 4 trees/m2 stand. Soil organic matter and nutrients except for total P significantly decreased in 8 trees m2 stand. Among the three density stands, the activities of urease, catalase and phosphatase were the lowest in 8 trees m2 stand. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
