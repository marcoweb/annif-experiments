#ITI#Optimizing crop geometry and nutrient management for yield, water productivity and economics of Kharif groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.)#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was conducted during kharif season of 2016 and 2017 at College of Agriculture, Gwalior. To optimise plant population and fertility levels an experiment was laid out in split plot design, replicated thrice in fixed plots and the test variety of the crop groundnut (Mallika) was used. The plant geometry of 30 × 10 cm, 25 × 10 cm and 20 × 10 cm was adopted with three fertility levels as 75, 100 and 125% recommended dose of fertilizers. The yield and economics were increased by optimization of plant geometry and nutrient management under kharif groundnut. Sowing of crop at 30×10 cm spacing resulted in 7.3 and 4.3 % higher pod yield over 25×10 cm and 20×10 cm spacing, respectively and 3.0 % higher haulm yield over 25×10 cm. Similarly, application of 125% RDF resulted in 3.0 and 9.3 % higher pod yield over 100% RDF and 75% RDF, respectively but application of 100% RDF resulted in 18.6% higher haulm yield over 75% RDF and was at par with 125 % RDF application. The highest gross, net returns and B:C ratio was obtained at the spacing of 30×10 cm with 125% RDF. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
