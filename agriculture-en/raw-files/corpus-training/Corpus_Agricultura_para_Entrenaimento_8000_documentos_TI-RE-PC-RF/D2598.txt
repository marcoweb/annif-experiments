#ITI#Influence of Nutrient Mobilizers on Productivity and Nutrient Uptake in Blackgram (Vigna mungo L.) Crop under the Tarai Region of Uttarakhand#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Pulses in Indian agriculture hold a vital position. They are considered as a rich source of vegetable protein, vitamins, minerals and calories to the entire vegetarians in India. Due to long and indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers, there is deterioration of soil health and hence decrease in productivity. Nutrient mobilizers such as Rhizobium, PGPRs are biological microorganisms that help in atmospheric N2 fixation along with phosphorous solubilization hence; increase the availability of nutrients to the plants. Methods: In this paper a field experiment was conducted during the kharif season of 2017 and 2018 to evaluate the influence of nutrient mobilizers along with recommended dose of fertilizers on productivity and nutrient uptake in blackgram. Result: A pronounced effect of nutrient mobilizers was observed on the yield attributing characters of urdbean. Maximum number of seeds per pod, 1000-seed weight, grain yield, straw yield, harvest index, maximum nutrient content and uptake in grain and straw was observed in the treatment T11 (Zn Nm + PGPR + ZnO @ 28.0 kg/ha + Rh+ RDF) followed by T10 (Rh + Zn Nm + PGPR + ZnO @ 14.0 kg/ha + RDF). It can be concluded that nutrient mobilizers not only increase the yield attributes in blackgram but also responsible for increase in nutrient content in the grains which ultimately signals positive attitude regarding nutritional security of the nation.
