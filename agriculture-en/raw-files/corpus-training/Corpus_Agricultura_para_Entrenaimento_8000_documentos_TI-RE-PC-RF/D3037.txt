#ITI#Stability by additive main multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model & genetic diversity studies in micro and macro-sperma lentil (Lens culinaris L.) in mid hills of Jammu and Kashmir, India#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation was aimed at ascertaining the nature and magnitude of genetic diversity among a set of 12 lentil genotypes through Mahalanobis D2Method. The genotypes under study fall into four clusters. The cluster-I contained the highest number of genotypes (05) followed by cluster-III (03) and Cluster-II and IV each contained the lowest (02). Cluster-II produced the highest mean value for days to maturity and cluster-I exhibited minimum mean value for pod length (0.64). The inter-cluster distances were much higher than the intra-cluster distances. Members of cluster -III and IV were highly diverse from each other as these clusters showed maximum inter-cluster distance. Cluster-IV exhibited the highest intra-cluster distance while the lowest distance was observed in cluster-I. The highest inter-cluster distance was observed between cluster-III and IV while the lowest was between cluster-I and III. The trait pod length (33.33%) contributed maximum for genetic diversity followed by seed yield /plant (27.27%), 100 seed weight (21.21%) and days to maturity (10.61%). Therefore these characters contributed maximum for getting the genetic diversity. Â© 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
