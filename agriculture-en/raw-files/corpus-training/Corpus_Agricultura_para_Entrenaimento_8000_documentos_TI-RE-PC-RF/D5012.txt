#ITI#Restriction fragment length polymorphism typing of infectious bursal disease virus field strains in Turkey#FTI#
#IRE#Infectious bursal disease (IBD), also known as Gumboro disease, is a highly contagious, immunosuppressive disease of immature chickens. It is caused by IBD virus (IBDV) and is responsible for major economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. In this study, 280 bursa samples from 56 commercially reared chicken flocks in Turkey with clinical symptoms of IBD were examined for IBDVs using the reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. The assay was conducted on a 743-bp fragment of the VP2 gene with the restriction enzymes BstNI, MboI, and SspI. The results indicate the existence of field isolates with new molecular patterns different from those previously published that may well be unique and specific to geographical regions.#FRE#
