#ITI#Development and application of quantitative real-time PCR for the rapid detection of hemorrhagic enteritis virus in tissue samples#FTI#
#IRE#Hemorrhagic enteritis virus (HEV) is a type II avian adenovirus that causes intestinal hemorrhages accompanied with immunosuppression in 4-to-12-wk-old turkeys. In the present study, a hexon gene-based, quantitative real-time PCR with TaqMan probe was developed and applied to tissue samples from poultry farms to detect and quantify HEV genome copy numbers. The method was confirmed to be rapid, specific, and sensitive for the detection of HEV. This method is an excellent research and diagnostic tool that can be used to study pathogenesis and to gain insights into different phases of infection on poultry farms and for high-throughput epidemiologic investigations.
