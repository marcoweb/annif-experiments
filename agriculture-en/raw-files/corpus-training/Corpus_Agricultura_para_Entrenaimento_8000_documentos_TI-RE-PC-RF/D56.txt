#ITI#The long-term persistence of transgenic volunteers in wild mustard and rice populations#FTI#
#IRE#The undesired presence of GM plants outside of cultivation is one of main concerns for the ecological risk assessment and regulation of GM plants, and how long transgenic volunteers can persist in the nature remains unknown. We conducted two long-term coexistence experiments of Bt-transgenic insect-resistant crops in populations of their wild relatives, using Bt-transgenic oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in wild mustard (B. juncea) populations from 2012 to 2019, and Bt-transgenic rice (Oryza sativa) in wild rice (O. rufipogon and O. minuta) populations from 2013 to 2019. Transgenic oilseed rape volunteers survived only in the 2012 winter, because it is a spring variety and not be resistant to cold climate and competition from weeds. Transgenic rice was not survived because of its low competitive ability compared to wild rice, but survived five years in one population of wild rice O. minuta who could not tolerant to cold temperature. Our results indicated that transgenic volunteers can persist in the wild populations under natural conditions, but the fate of transgenic volunteers in the nature depends on whether the growth environment is favorable, and they could not disperse over its niche or “tolerance zone”. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
