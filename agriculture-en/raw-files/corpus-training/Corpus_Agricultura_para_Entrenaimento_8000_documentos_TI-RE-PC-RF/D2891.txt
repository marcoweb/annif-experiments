#ITI#Heterosis and inbreeding depression for vegetative traits in groundnut (Arachis Hypogaea L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Among twenty eight F 1s studied, twenty F 1s exhibited significant positive heterosis over better parent. The F 1, TPT-4 x K-1375 expressed the highest significant positive relative heterosis (41.73%) and heterobeltiosis (35.09%) with moderate inbreeding depression (11.39%) indicating the presence of additive gene action for the expression of plant height. For number of primary branches per plant, the F 1, ICGV-91114 x K-1375 recorded the highest significant positive heterosis over midparent (41.68%), heterobeltiosis (22.48%) and standard heterosis (40.35%) with the highest (22.22%) inbreeding depression indicating the chances of getting desirable genotypes through selection from the further segregating generations of this cross. The F 1, ICGV-91114 x K-1375 recorded the highest relative heterosis (469.23%) and heterobeltiosis (428.57%) coupled with high positive inbreeding depression for number of secondary branches per plant indicating the preponderance of additive gene action in the inheritance of this trait.#FRE#
