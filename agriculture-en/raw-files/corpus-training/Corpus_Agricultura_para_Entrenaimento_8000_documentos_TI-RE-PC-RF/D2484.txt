#ITI#Effect of planting methods on growth and yield of groundnut cultivars#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The low yield in groundnut which can be partly attributed to poor land preparation methods necessitated the need for alternative strategy of land preparation that will promote higher productivity in groundnut farming. Methods: A field experiment was carried out in two separate locations between May and August in 2016 to assess the effect of planting methods on growth and yield of groundnut cultivars. Result: The results revealed that groundnut crop sown on modified ridges and furrow with narrow furrow planting recorded significantly higher plant height, number of leaves, 50% flowering, yield attributes and yield when compared to other methods of planting All the groundnut cultivars responded positively to all planting methods except those grown on flat surface without beds. However, modified ridges and furrow with narrow furrow planting proved to be the best method. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
