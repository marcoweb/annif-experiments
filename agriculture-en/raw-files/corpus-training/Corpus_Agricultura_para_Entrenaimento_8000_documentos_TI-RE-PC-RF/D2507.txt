#ITI#Seed bio-priming of green gram with Rhizobium and levels of nitrogen and sulphur fertilization under sustainable agriculture#FTI#
#IRE#The experiment was laid out in a factorial randomized block design comprising eighteen treatment combinations of three levels of N (0, 10 and 20 kg ha-1), three levels of S (0, 10 and 20 kg ha-1) and two levels of biofertilizer (seed bio-priming and without Rhizobium) which were replicated three times. The results indicated that plot with the application of N and S @ 20 kg ha-1 gave significantly (p< 0.05) higher seed yield (~ 32 and 21%) and stover yield (~ 16 and 18%) as compared to control plot, respectively. Bio-primed observed significantly (p < 0.05) higher seed yield (~ 996 kg ha-1) and stover yield (~ 1829 kg ha-1) as compared to un-inoculated treatments. Meanwhile, plot with the application of N and S @ 20 kg ha-1 + bio-priming @ 25 g kg-1 seeds on loamy sand soil resulted the increased the seed yield ~ 32, 21 and 7%, respectively and nutrients availability besides organic carbon (5, 2 and 2.3%), available N (5, 4.5 and 4.6%), P2O5 (7.5, 2 and 0.5%), and S (12, 22 and 11%, respectively) concentration increased in soil after harvest of green gram under bio-primed treatments.
