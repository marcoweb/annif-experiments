#ITI#Propolis production by honey bee apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and its potential for the management of the larger grain borer prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) on maize grains#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of the study was to evaluate a possibility of propolis production by honey bee Apis mellifera (Horn) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) and its potential for the management of the larger grain borer (LGB) Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae) on maize grains. Bee propolis was collected from hives kept on the field for twelve months; they were thereafter diluted with ethanol to obtain 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% concentrations. 5 ml each of the concentrations was applied to 150 g clean maize grains infested with 10 pairs of 1-5 days old LGB in 250 cm3 Kilner jars. The control jars were treated with ethanol. At 90 days post-infestation, data were collected on percentage of weight loss, percentage of grain damage, weight of frass generated (g), number of pupae, larvae and adult LGB. The results indicated that monthly propolis yield was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the period of honey flow (December-March) relative to other periods. Propolis at all the concentrations tested reduced the population of LGB in propolis-treated maize grains relative to non-propolis treated-ones. The highest effects of propolis was shown at the highest concentration of 20% and it was significantly (p < 0.05) different from its effects at other concentrations. Bee propolis may be integrated with other ecological friendly control methods to manage LGB infestation in maize.#FRE#
