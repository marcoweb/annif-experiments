#ITI#Effect of Phosphorus on Yield, Nutrient Acquisition and Use Efficiency of Groundnut in West Bengal, India#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Phosphorus is the crucial element to enhance yields as well bio-chemical properties namely protein and oil content in groundnut. Buildup of insoluble phosphates and chemical fixation in soil reduces phosphorus consumption ability in plants. Phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) can be increased with higher levels of phosphorus rate. The study was framed to investigate the effect of phosphorus fertilization on yield, nutrient acquisition, use efficiency and bio-chemical compositions of groundnut. Methods: The experiment was conducted in summer seasons of 2016 and 2017, using split plot design with three varieties (‘JL-24’, ‘Gangapuri’, ‘TAG-24’) in main plot and four fertilization levels (0, 40, 60, 80 kg P2 O5 ha-1) in sub plots. Result: The study revealed that pod yield enhanced significantly by 15.4%, 27.3% and 39.9% with increase in fertilization rates from 40 kg to 80 kg ha-1 compare to unfertilized plots. Protein and oil content showed a positive response with phosphorus application. Agronomic efficiency, recovery efficiency and utilization efficiency were also increased with phosphorus rates, whereas, partial factor productivity, agro-physiological efficiency and physiological efficiency had decreasing trends. ‘Gangapuri’ gave higher pod yield (1.80 t ha-1), protein (24.27%) and oil (45.41%) content than other selected varieties. Enhanced phosphorus rate also increases nutrient uptake in groundnut. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
