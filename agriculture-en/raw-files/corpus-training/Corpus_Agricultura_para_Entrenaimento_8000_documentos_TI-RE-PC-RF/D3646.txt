#ITI#Role of abiotic factors on seasonal abundance and infestation of fruit fly, Bactrocera Cucurbitae (COQ.) on bitter gourd#FTI#
#IRE#Throughout the year, there was an abundance of fruit flies in Cue-lure baited traps. Two peaks; in summer and kharif (Autumn) coincided with the 14 SW and 43 SW respectively. In kharif, maximum bitter gourd fruit damage (62.70%) occurred in the 45 SW. A second peak, with 49.70% fruit damage was observed during the 15 SW period. The temperature (maximum and minimum) showed a significant positive correlation with adult abundance, fruit damage and pupal population. The temperature recorded during the preceding first, second and third weeks had a slightly greater impact than the temperature of the current week in which the fruit fly abundance had been checked. Other abiotic factors had a non-significant effect on fruit fly adult activity, fruit damage and pupal population.#FRE#
