#ITI#Dynamic nitrogen reallocation in rice plants upon insect herbivory by a generalist lepidopteran pest Spodoptera litura (Fabricius)#FTI#
#IRE#Nitrogen (N) is a limited nutrient for both plants and herbivores. How plants reallocate N upon herbivore attack is vital for plant tolerance to herbivores. Here we investigated N reallocation in rice during a 2-day herbivore attack by a generalist herbivore Spodoptera litura and 2 days after herbivore removal. Labeled 15N was translocated during insect attack from feeding-damaged leaves to roots, particularly to young roots. The amounts of chlorophyll and Rubisco were significantly reduced in the attacked leaves. Both free amino acids and nitrate accumulated in the damaged leaves and young roots, while ammonium content was decreased. Activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase were enhanced in feeding-damaged leaves but inhibited in young roots. The expression of amino acid transporters OsAAP6, OsAAT15, and jasmonate-responsive genes OsAOS, OsMAPK3, OsMAPK6 was induced in the damaged leaves. However, 2 days after herbivore removal, N uptake was increased and herbivory-induced 15N transfer to roots was partially reverted back to the damaged leaves, resulting in N levels in the previously damaged leaves were even higher than that in control leaves. Collectively, our results indicate a dynamic N reallocation in rice responses to insect herbivory. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
