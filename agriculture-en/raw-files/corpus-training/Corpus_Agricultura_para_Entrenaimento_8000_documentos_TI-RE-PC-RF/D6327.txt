#ITI#The potential for crop to wild hybridization in eggplant (Solanum melongena; Solanaceae) in Southern India#FTI#
#IRE#• Premise of the study: In India and elsewhere, transgenic Bt eggplant (Solanum melongena) has been developed to reduce insect herbivore damage, but published studies of the potential for pollen-mediated, crop- to- wild gene flow are scant. This information is useful for risk assessments as well as in situ conservation strategies for wild germplasm.#FRE#
