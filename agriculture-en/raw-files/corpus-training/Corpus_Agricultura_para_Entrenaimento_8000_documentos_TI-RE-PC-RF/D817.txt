#ITI#Response of source-sink relationship to progressive water deficit in the domestication of dryland wheat#FTI#
#IRE#It is crucial to clarify the physiological responses of wheat (T. aestivum) plants to source-sink manipulation and assimilation transportation under drought stress during domestication of dryland wheat. In this research, a two-year field experiment was conducted using nine wheat cultivars in a semiarid site of northwest China. The source-sink manipulation treatments including defoliation of flag leaves and 50% removal of ears were applied at the anthesis stage under two levels of drought stress conditions i.e. progressive water supply (PWS) and rainfed drought treatment (RDT). Our results indicated that drought stress reduced the dry weight of leaves, sheaths and stems, as well as caused a significant yield reduction. High ploidy wheat exhibits a greater capacity to sustain higher grain yields when subjected to drought stress, primarily due to its stronger buffer capacity between source supply and sink demand. All wheat species with different ploidy levels had a certain degree of source limitation and sink restriction. During the domestication of wheat, the type of source and sink might be ploidy-dependent with progressive water deficit, but similar interactive relationships. The source-sink ratio of tetraploid species was the largest, while that of hexaploid species was the lowest. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
