#ITI#Mycorrhizae influence plant vegetative and floral traits and intraspecific trait variation#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can strongly influence host plant vegetative growth, but less is known about AMF effects on other plant traits, the relative impacts of AMF on vegetative growth versus floral traits, or AMF-induced intraspecific variation in traits. Methods: In an experimental greenhouse study, we inoculated seven species of wildflowers with six species of AMF in a factorial design. We assessed how the AMF–forb combinations influenced plant survival, vegetative biomass, and floral traits and whether AMF effects on floral traits were similar in magnitude and direction to effects on vegetative biomass. For one forb species, we investigated intraspecific plant trait variation within and across AMF treatments. Results: AMF species varied from negative to positive in their effects on host plants. AMF often had inconsistent effects on vegetative biomass versus floral traits, and therefore, quantifying one or the other may provide a misleading representation of potential AMF effects. AMF treatments generated key variation in plant traits, especially floral traits, with potential consequences for plant–pollinator interactions. Given increased intraspecific trait variation in Linum lewisii plants across AMF species compared to uninoculated individuals or single AMF treatments, local AMF diversity and their host plant associations may scale up to influence community-wide patterns of trait variation and species interactions. Conclusions: These results have implications for predicting how aboveground communities are affected by belowground communities. Including AMF effects on not just host plant biomass but also functional traits and trait variation will deepen our understanding of community structure and function, including pollination. © 2022 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
