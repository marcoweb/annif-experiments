#ITI#The growth promotion in endophyte symbiotic plants does not penalise the resistance to herbivores and bacterial microbiota#FTI#
#IRE#A trade-off between growth and defence against biotic stresses is common in plants. Fungal endophytes of the genus Epichloë may relieve this trade-off in their host grasses since they can simultaneously induce plant growth and produce antiherbivore alkaloids that circumvent the need for host defence. The Epichloë ability to decouple the growth-defence trade-off was evaluated by subjecting ryegrass with and without Epichloë endophytes to an exogenous treatment with gibberellin (GA) followed by a challenge with Rhopalosiphum padi aphids. In agreement with the endophyte-mediated trade-off decoupling hypothesis, the GA-derived promotion of plant growth increased the susceptibility to aphids in endophyte-free plants but did not affect the insect resistance in endophyte-symbiotic plants. In line with the unaltered insect resistance, the GA treatment did not reduce the concentration of Epichloë-derived alkaloids. The Epichloë mycelial biomass was transiently increased by the GA treatment but at the expense of hyphal integrity. The response of the phyllosphere bacterial microbiota to both GA treatment and Epichloë was also evaluated. Only Epichloë, and not the GA treatment, altered the composition of the phyllosphere microbiota and the abundance of certain bacterial taxa. Our findings clearly demonstrate that Epichloë does indeed relieve the plant growth-defence trade-off. © 2024 The Authors. Plant, Cell & Environment published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
