#ITI#Genetics of yellow mosaic virus (YMV) resistance in cultivated soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]#FTI#
#IRE#In the present study, 100 soybean germplasm were screened for three years (2009-2011) in New Delhi, a hot-spot for YMV disease in order to identify resistant sources. A set of 29 genotypes, mostly improved varieties of Northern India were identified with higher level of resistance consistently over the years. The inheritance of YMV resistance studied in F1 and F2 populations of three crosses involving two highly resistant varieties DS9712 and DS9814 and two highly susceptible genotypes JS335 and PI542044 indicated that the resistance is dominant and is controlled by single major gene. The chi-square test showed complete fitness to 3 resistant: 1 susceptible ratio in all the three F2 populations viz., PI542044 × DS9712, PI542044 × DS9814 and JS335 × DS9712. The findings of the study will pave the way for mapping the gene for YMV resistance with linked molecular marker. The segregating populations generated will act as starting materials for developing improved lines with YMV resistance.#FRE#
