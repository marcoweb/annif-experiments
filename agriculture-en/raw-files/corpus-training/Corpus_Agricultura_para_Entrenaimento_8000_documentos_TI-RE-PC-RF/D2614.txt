#ITI#Productivity, input and operational costs and marketing efficiency of guar [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) taub]: A legume crop in Haryana#FTI#
#IRE#A field study was conducted in Sirsa, Bhiwani and Hisar in Department of Economics, Baba Mastnath University Rohtak to study the productivity, economics and marketing efficiency of guar during the year 2014-15. It was found that among the operational costs for cultivation of guar, the preparatory cost was significantly higher in Hisar (` 2834/ha) as compared to Sirsa and Bhiwani, while the presowing irrigation was higher in Sirsa district. The sowing costs was significantly higher in Sirsa (` 957/ha). Threshing and transportation costs were significantly higher in Sirsa (` 3924 and ` 350). FYM, DAP, irrigation and chemical weeding were significantly positively correlated with yield. Marketing channel-III (producer and processor only) was found most efficient with an efficiency of 12.03. Â© 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
