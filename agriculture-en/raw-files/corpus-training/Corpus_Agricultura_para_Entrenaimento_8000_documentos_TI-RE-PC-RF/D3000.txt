#ITI#Effect of iron source on iron deficiency induced chlorosis in groundnut#FTI#
#IRE#In a field study, the effect of iron source through foliar as well as basal application was studied on lime induced iron-deficiency chlorosis (LIIC), chlorophyll content, nitrate reductase activity, available Fe and micronutrients in groundnut. The visual chlorotic rating screen of various Fe-efficient and Fe-inefficient cultivars clearly identified Fe-efficient and Fe-inefficient. Tirupati-4 was showing symptoms of chlorosis and was Fe-inefficient. Fe absorption capacity varied among cultivars. Applications of iron increased active Fe content in LGN-2 by 5.6 % and 163.18% in CSMG-84-1 respectively. A significant increase in chlorophyll content (10%) and nitrate reductase (110%) was observed with foliar spray of FeSO4. A significant damage of lipid peroxidation was observed in absence of iron which was improved by 37% in Tirupati-4 and 16.67% in CSMG-84-1 by foliar and basal supplementation of Fe, respectively. A strong correlation among the Fe, Mn, Zn and K depicted ionomic interaction with different treatments. Based on the ion absorption capacity and the level of chlorosis, the groundnut genotypes were grouped as tolerant, moderately tolerant and sensitive to iron chlorosis. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
