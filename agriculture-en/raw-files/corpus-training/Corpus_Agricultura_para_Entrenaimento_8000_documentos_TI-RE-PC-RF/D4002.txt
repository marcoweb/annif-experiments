#ITI#Vaccination of 1-Day-Old Turkey Poults with Fowlpox Vaccine by Subcutaneous Route#FTI#
#IRE#In high-challenge areas, 1-day-old chicks are often vaccinated with fowlpox vaccine to provide early protection against the disease. However, we were unable to find any information in the published literature on the safety and efficacy of live fowlpox virus vaccine in 1-day-old Turkeys. In this study, we evaluated a freeze-dried chicken-embryo-origin live fowlpox virus vaccine for its safety and efficacy in 1-day-old Turkey poults by administering the vaccine subcutaneously in the upper back of the neck. Following vaccination, the Turkeys were observed for 3 wk for vaccine-associated mortality and adverse reactions. Efficacy was evaluated by challenging the Turkeys against a standard challenge strain of fowlpox virus. The results of this study indicated that the vaccine was safe and efficacious for subcutaneous administration in 1-day-old Turkeys. None of the vaccinated Turkeys revealed any adverse reactions or mortality associated with the vaccine. The vaccine protected more than 98% of the Turkeys against fowlpox virus challenge.
