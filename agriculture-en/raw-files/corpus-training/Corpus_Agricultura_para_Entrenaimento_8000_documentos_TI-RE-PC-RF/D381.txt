#ITI#Physiological mechanisms of exogenous organic acids to alleviate aluminum toxicity in seedlings of mungbean, buckwheat, and rice#FTI#
#IRE#One of the major constraints for crop yield in acidic soils is the phytotoxicity of aluminum ions (Al3+), which primarily affects the roots. To mitigate the harmful effects of Al toxicity, plants use organic acids to chelate Al internally and externally. In this study, the effects of exogenous organic acids on Al toxicity in rice, mung bean, and buckwheat were investigated. Specifically, the study examined the ameliorative effect of three organic acids (oxalic acid, malic acid, and citric acid, each at a concentration of (100 μmol/L) on root elongation, fresh weight, Al content, organic acid key enzymes, and rhizosphere pH in hydroponic media containing (100 μmol/L) Al. The experimental results revealed species-specific responses to aluminum tolerance and the alleviating effects of different organic acids. Buckwheat was found to be the most aluminum-tolerant, followed by mung bean, while rice was the least tolerant. Exogenous application of oxalic acid promoted root elongation, increased root fresh weight, and enhanced the activity of the PEPC enzyme in mung bean. Malic acid, on the other hand, alleviated Al toxicity in rice by promoting root elongation, increasing root fresh weight, enhancing the activity of the PEPC enzyme, and decreasing the activity of the MDH enzyme. In buckwheat, citric acid application reduced Al toxicity by promoting root elongation, increasing root weight, and decreasing the activities of CS and GO enzymes. These findings indicate that different organic acids can reduce Al toxicity in different plant species by employing different physiological mechanisms. © 2023#FRE#
