#ITI#Temperature and PH impact on the mycelium growth of Mycogone perniciosa and Verticillium fungicola isolates derived from Polish and foreign mushroom growing houses#FTI#
#IRE#The research project aimed at determining the effect of incubation temperature and pH of the agar medium on the mycelium growth of Mycogone perniciosa (Magnus) Delacroix and Verticillium fungicola (Preuss) Hassebrauk in in vitro conditions. Ten M. perniciosa and ten V. fungicola isolates were applied. Mycelium growth of the above-mentioned isolates was studied on PDA agar medium (Merck) enriched with an extract from mushroom hyphae, at temperatures ranging from 15 to 30°C and pH from 5.5 to 7.5. Incubation temperature was found to affect the mycelium growth rate of the examined pathogens. Mycelium growth in all M. perniciosa and V. fungicola isolates was the fastest at the temperature of 25°C, while a temperature of 15°C inhibited their growth significantly. Mycelium growth of the examined pathogens also depended on medium pH. M. perniciosa mycelium developed best at pH = 5.5, whereas at the same medium pH V. fungicola mycelium exhibited the worst growth.#FRE#
