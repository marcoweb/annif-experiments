#ITI#Effect of irrigation systems, amounts of irrigation water and mulching on corn yield, water use efficiency and net profit#FTI#
#IRE#Two field experiments were conducted in a sandy soil to study the effects of two irrigation systems [drip (DIS) and sprinkler (SIS)], three amounts of irrigation water (AIW) [I100 = 100%, I85 = 85% and I70 = 70% of the crop evapotranspiration] and five mulching [farmyard manure (FYM)] treatments [0 ton ha-1 (FYM0), 10 ton ha-1 spread on the soil surface or incorporated with surface layer (FYM10s or FYM10m, respectively) and 20 ton ha-1 spread on the soil surface or incorporated with surface layer (FYM20s or FYM20m, respectively)] on corn yield, water use efficiency (WUE) and net profit. The maximum values of grain yield (GY) were obtained under DIS compared to SIS. The highest values of GY were obtained from I100 treatment while the lowest ones were observed in I70 treatment. FYM20m enhanced GY than FYM0, FYM10s, FYM10m and FYM20s in the two growing seasons. The highest GY and WUE were recorded for plants irrigated with I100 and receiving FYM20m under DIS. Under Sebha environmental conditions and similar regions, we recommend applying the cultivation of corn plants under the treatment (I100 × FYM20m) as it is the most suitable for producing high GY and consequently net profit, using either DIS or SIS wherever either of the two systems is available. Under limited irrigation water, application of (I85 × FYM20m) treatment using DIS was found to be favorable to save 15% of the applied irrigation water, at the time in which produced the same GY and consequently net profit. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
