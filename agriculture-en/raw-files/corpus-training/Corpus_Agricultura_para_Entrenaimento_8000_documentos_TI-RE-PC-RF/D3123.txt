#ITI#Influence of mulching practices, varieties and fertility levels on growth and productivity of clusterbean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taubert]#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during the rainy (kharif) season of 2013 and 2014 to find out the effect of “influence of mulching practices, varieties and fertility levels on growth and productivity of clusterbean”.The results revealed that the plastic mulch significantly increased the growth and yield characterstics, seed yield as well as economics over the weed biomass mulch and no mulch. Variety HG-563 recorded significantly higher growth characterstics, yield attributing, seed yield and economics as compared to RGC-1055. Among the fertility levels, application of 75% RDF + VC 5 t/ha resulted in significantly higher growth characterstics, yield attributing, seed yield and economics over all the remaining fertility levels. Thus, it can be concluded that in clusterbean (variety HG-563), adoption of plastic mulch along with RDF 75%+ 5 t/ha vermicompost is recommended for erratic and scarce rainfall as well as low sustainability of soil. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
