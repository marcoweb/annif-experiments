#ITI#Distribution of acid extractable P and exchangeable K in a grassland soil as affected by long-term surface application of N, P and K fertilizers#FTI#
#IRE#Information on the fate and distribution of surface-applied fertilizer P and K in soil is needed in order to assess their availability to plants and potential for water contamination. Distribution of extractable P (in 0.03 M NH4F + 0.03 M H2SO4 solution) and exchangeable K (in neutral 1.0 M ammonium acetate solution) in the soil as a result of selected combinations of 30 years (1968-1997) of N fertilization (84-336 kg N ha-1), 10 years of P fertilization (0-132 kg P ha-1), and 14 years of K fertilization (0 and 46 kg K ha-1) was studied in a field experiment on a thin Black Chernozem loam under smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.) at Crossfield, Alberta, Canada. Soil samples were taken at regular intervals in October 1997 from 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-90 and 90-120 cm layers. Soil pH decreased with N rate and this declined with soil depth. Increase in extractable P concentration in the soil reflected 10 years of P fertilization relative to no P fertilization, even though it had been terminated 20 years prior to soil sampling. The magnitude and depth of increase in extractable P paralleled N and P rates. The extractable P concentration in the 0-5 cm soil layer increased by 2.2, 20.7, 30.4 and 34.5 mg P kg -1 soil at 84, 168, 280 and 336 kg N ha-1, respectively. The increase in extractable P concentration in the 0-15 cm soil depth was 1.5 and 12.8 mg P kg-1 soil with application of 16 and 33 kg P ha -1 (N rate of 84 N ha-1 for both treatments), respectively; and it was 81.6 and 155.2 mg P kg-1 soil with application of 66 and 132 kg P ha-1 (N rate of 336 N ha-1 for both treatments), respectively. The increase in extractable P at high N rates was attributed to N-induced soil acidification. Most of the increase in extractable P occurred in the top 10-cm soil layer and almost none was noticed below 30 cm depth. Surface-applied K was able to prevent depletion of exchangeable K from the 0-90 cm soil, which occurred with increased bromegrass production from N fertilization in the absence of K application. As only a small increase of exchangeable K was observed in the 10-30 cm soil, 46 kg K ha-1 year-1 was considered necessary to achieve a balance between fertilization and bromegrass uptake for K. The potential for P contamination of surface water may be increased with the high N and P rates, as most of the increase in extractable P occurred near the soil surface.#FRE#
