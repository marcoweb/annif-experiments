#ITI#Cotton yield and water use efficiency at various levels of water and N through drip irrigation under two methods of planting#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the effect of various levels of water and N application through drip irrigation on seed cotton yield and water use efficiency (WUE). In this experiment three levels of water (Epan 0.4, 0.3, and 0.2) and three levels of N (100, 75, and 50% of recommended N, 75 kg/ha) through drip were compared with check-basin method of irrigation under two methods of planting (normal sowing, NS; paired sowing, PS). The results revealed that when the same quantity of irrigation water and N was applied through drip irrigation system, it increased the seed cotton yield to 2144 from 1624 kg/ha (an increase of 32%) under check-basin method of irrigation. When the quantity of water through drip was reduced to 75%, the increase in seed cotton yield was 12%; however, when water was reduced to 50%, it resulted 2% lower yield than check-basin. The decrease in N through fertigation resulted in reduction in seed cotton yield at all the levels of water supply, but the magnitude of reduction was the highest at highest level of water supply. In paired sowing (PS), 20% higher seed cotton yield was obtained as compared with check-basin method under NS along with 50% saving of water. In paired sowing the sacrifice of 9% seed cotton yield as compared with NS resulted in saving of 50% water as well as the cost of laterals because there was one lateral for two paired rows. The WUE increased by 26% (22.1 from 17.6 kg/ha cm) in drip irrigation system when same quantity of water and N fertilizer was applied as compared with check-basin. WUE was not affected with quantity of water but decrease in rate of N caused a decrease in WUE at all the quantities of water applied. In general, WUE was higher in PS as compared with NS. The agronomic efficiency of nitrogen increased from 21.65 to 28.59 kg of seed cotton per kg of N applied when same quantity of water and N was applied through drip irrigation as compared with check-basin. However, decrease in quantity of water applied resulted in a decrease in agronomic efficiency of N but reverse was true for rates of N applied. When the same quantity of water and N was applied under both the methods of planting, PS produced 22% higher seed cotton yield and along with reduced cost owing to half the number of laterals required.
