#ITI#Identification of suitable ideotypes of blackgram (Vigna Mungo L. Hepper) for intercropping with sorghum (Sorghum Bicolar L. Moench)#FTI#
#IRE#The treatment comprised 10 varieties of blackgram intercropped with sorghum at 1:1 ratio sown. The grain yield of blackgram and sorghum was influenced significantly due to different intercropping treatments. RBU-38 blackgram intercropped with sorghum proved the most remunerative for this region. The growth parameters, yield attributes and productivity parameters indicated that intercropping of blackgram variety RBU-38 with sorghum. was most remunerative. It gave the maximum yield of sorghum (4639.23 kg/ha) and blackgram (551.44 kg/ha) as well as blackgram-equivalent yield (1943.17 kg/ha) and net return upto Rs. 51399/ha along with 1:7.45 B:C ratio.#FRE#
