#ITI#Influence of integrated nutrient management on growth, yield parameters and yield in french bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)#FTI#
#IRE#An investigation was carried out during rabi season of 2013-14 at vegetable farm, College of Horticulture, Mandsaur (Gwalior) to study the effect of integrated nutrient management on growth, yield parameters and yield in French bean. The treatments comprised six nutrient levels N1, N2, N3, N4, N5 and N6 and three varieties viz., Arka Komal (V1), Contender (V2) and Swarna Priya (V3). It was noticed that application of nutrient levels and varieties had significant influence on growth, yield and yield parameters. Nutrient level N4 [Vermicompost (10t/ha) + N (50kg/ha) + Rhizobium (15g/kg seed) + PSB (15g/kg seed) + P2O5 (80kg/ha) + K2O (80kg/ha)] recorded the maximum plant height (57.92cm), fresh weight of shoot (43.70g), dry weight of shoot (11.33g), number of pod per plant (31.81), pod length (15.55cm), shelling percent (76.87%), harvest index (26.82%), seed yield per plant (17.35g) and seed yield per hectare (25.22q). The maximum days for 50 per cent flowering were taken with the application of N6 nutrient level which was significantly higher over other nutrient levels. Among the varieties Swarna Priya (V3) recorded the highest growth, yield parameters and yield in French bean. Earliest 50% flowering was recorded in variety Contender followed by Arka Komal.
