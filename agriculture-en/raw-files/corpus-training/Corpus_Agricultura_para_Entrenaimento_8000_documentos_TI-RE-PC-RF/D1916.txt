#IRE#                             Ground cover rice production system is a promising technique with potentials to alleviate the effect of the increasing water-scarcity on rice production. Hence, finding appropriate management practices under this system is crucial for reducing global warming without yield loss. In this study, CH                             4                              and N                             2                             O were quantified and contrasted in drip irrigation with plastic-film-mulch system (DP) and a continuous flooded rice cultivation system (CF) during two rice growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. The range of methane fluxes observed between irrigation regimes was (− 0.36 to 0.43 mg m                             −2                              h                             −1                             ) and (− 0.77 to 4.66 mg m                             −2                              h                             −1                             ) in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The cumulative CH                             4                              emissions in 2017 under CF and DP were 16 times and 5 times higher than in 2016 respectively. DP reduced cumulative CH                             4                              flux by 194% and 69% in 2016 and 2017 respectively compared to CF. Emissions of N                             2                             O were low and insignificant for both irrigation regimes. Grain yields were comparable between irrigation regimes with an insignificant reduction of 19% and 5% under DP in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The GWP of the 2-year average was 89% reduced under DP compared to CF. Our findings demonstrated that the DP mitigated GHGs while sustaining rice yield as a result of low nitrogen fertilization application and intermittent soil saturation level.                          © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
