#ITI#Water-deficit stress induces prenylated stilbenoid production and affects biomass in peanut hairy roots: Exploring the role of stilbenoid prenyltransferase downregulation#FTI#
#IRE#The peanut plant is one of the most economically important crops around the world. Abiotic stress, such as drought, causes over five hundred million dollars in losses in peanut production per year. Peanuts are known to produce prenylated stilbenoids to counteract biotic stress. However, their role in abiotic stress tolerance has not been elucidated. To address this issue, hairy roots with the capacity to produce prenylated stilbenoids were established. An RNA-interference (RNAi) molecular construct targeting the stilbenoid-specific prenyltransferase AhR4DT-1 was designed and expressed via Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation in hairy roots of peanut cultivar Georgia Green. Two transgenic hairy roots with the RNAi molecular construct were established, and the downregulation of AhR4DT-1 was validated using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. To determine the efficacy of the RNAi-approach in modifying the levels of prenylated stilbenoids, the hairy roots were co-treated with methyl jasmonate, hydrogen peroxide, cyclodextrin, and magnesium chloride to induce the production of stilbenoids and then the stilbenoids were analyzed in extracts of the culture medium. Highly reduced levels of prenylated stilbenoids were observed in the RNAi hairy roots. Furthermore, the hairy roots were evaluated in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) assay to assess the role of prenylated stilbenoids on water-deficit stress. Upon PEG treatment, stilbenoids were induced and secreted into the culture medium of RNAi and wild-type hairy roots. Additionally, the biomass of the RNAi hairy roots decreased by a higher amount as compared to the wild-type hairy roots suggesting that prenylated stilbenoids might play a role against water-deficit stress.
