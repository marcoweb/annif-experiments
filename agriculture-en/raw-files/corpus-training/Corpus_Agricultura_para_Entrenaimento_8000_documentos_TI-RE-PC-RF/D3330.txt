#ITI#Estimation of groundnut kernel aflatoxins by high performance liquid chromatography using immunoaffinity column clean up and post column photochemical derivatization#FTI#
#IRE#This study was carried out in order to quantify the aflatoxins with precision through High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) using Immunoaffinity column clean up, Post Column Photochemical Derivatization and flurescence detection. Standard aflatoxin peaks (G1, G2, B1, B2) obtained by the above HPLC unit were sharp without any disturbances in the chromatogram. Peanuts which were artificially inoculated with virulent strain of Aspergillus flavus and in healthy peanuts were tested for aflatoxin levels by HPLC. The aflatoxin B1 was 516 ppb in infected sample and was completely absent in healthy groundnut kernels. Aflatoxin B1 concentration estimated by Indirect Competitive ELISA method (523 ppb) is slightly higher than those detected by HPLC (516 ppb).#FRE#
