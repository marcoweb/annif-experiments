#ITI#Host Preference and Damage Assessment of Pulse Beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus (Fabricius) (Chrysomelidae: Coleoptera) on Different Hosts#FTI#
#IRE#The host preference of pulse beetle, C. maculatus to selected host grains were evaluated under laboratory conditions in the Department of Entomology and Agricultural Zoology, Banaras Hindu University during the year 2018. Cowpea and green gram were most preferred hosts for C. maculatus in terms of oviposition, per cent survival and mean developmental periods. Red gram and soybean were comparatively less preferred host for oviposition (66.38 eggs/50 seeds and 69.00 eggs/50 seeds respectively) than other host grains. In terms of per cent grain damage (92.25%; 90.19%) and per cent weight loss of grains (76.27%; 75.92%) cowpea and green gram were most preferable hosts respectively after 120 days after insect inoculation.
