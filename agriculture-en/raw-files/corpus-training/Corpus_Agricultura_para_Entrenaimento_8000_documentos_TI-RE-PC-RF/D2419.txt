#ITI#Evaluation and molecular characterization of advanced interspecific lines for genetic improvement in mungbean [vigna radiata (L.) wilczek]#FTI#
#IRE#The present study was undertaken to evaluate advanced interspecific lines of mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] for yield and its components and to understand genetic diversity among these lines using microsatellite markers (SSRs). The experimental material consisted of 51 advanced interspecific lines developed from mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] ×urdbean [Vigna mungo L. Hepper] and mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] ×ricebean [Vigna umbellata Thumb.] crosses and 13 parental lines (mungbean, urdbean and ricebean). A wide range of variability was observed for eleven yield and its component characters and many superior lines were identified. SSR markers synthesised from different Vigna species were used to assess genetic diversity in advanced interspecific lines along with their parents. The interspecific lines were converged into three main clusters while the parental lines were converged into three main and four sub clusters, depicting genetic diversity among them. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
