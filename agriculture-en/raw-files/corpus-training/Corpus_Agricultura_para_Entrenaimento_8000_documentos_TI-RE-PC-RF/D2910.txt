#ITI#Identification of Highly Polymorphic Molecular Markers and Potential Genotypes for Harnessing Chickpea Breeding Strategies#FTI#
#IRE#Background: STMS markers and morphological traits were used to investigate the genetic relationship and allelic diversity in chickpea. In this study, we focused on the selection and more efficient utilization of core germplasm in breeding programs for chickpea crop improvement using STMS and quantitative/morphological traits. Methods: Seeds of elite accessions of chickpea were obtained from ICRISAT, Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India. 50 STMS markers and 11 quantitative traits were used for exploring the genetic variability and relationship in 35 chickpea accessions. Result: A total of 97 alleles were produced out of the 32 polymorphic STMS loci with an average of 3.03 alleles per locus ranging between 2-6 alleles per primer. The PIC value ranged from 0.029 to 0.768 with an average of 0.502. PIC value showed a highly positive correlation (r = 0.718) with number of alleles at the STMS loci. In both molecular and morphological markers/traits-based clustering, out of 35 chickpea accessions only one accession ICC-13892 was isolated at the end of clustering. The results indicated that highly polymorphic microsatellite markers NCPGR 68, NCPGR 50, NCPGR 81, NCPGR 48 and NCPGR 77 along with the accessions ICC-13892 having distant associations with ICC-13816, ICC-15697, ICC-15610, ICC-15868, ICC-15888, ICC-15996 with novel findings should be useful resources for strategies of allele mining, association genetics, mapping and cloning of gene(s) and in applied breeding to broaden the genetic base of chickpea. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
