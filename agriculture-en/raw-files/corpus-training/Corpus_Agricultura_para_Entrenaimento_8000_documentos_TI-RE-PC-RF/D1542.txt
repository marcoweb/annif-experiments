#ITI#Effects of plant residue quality, application rate, and placement method on phosphorus availability from Sokoto rock phosphate#FTI#
#IRE#Plant residues are being suggested as an amendment to enhance P release from rock phosphate, however, plant residue enhanced P release could depend on the residue quality, application rate and placement method. Effects of plant residue quality, application rate and placement method on solubility and P release from rock phosphate (PR) were studied in laboratory and field experiments. Leaves of ten woody and herbaceous species were incubated in a P-deficient soil with Sokoto PR under laboratory conditions to study the effects of residue quality on P release from PR. Effects of residue application rate and placement method were investigated in a field trial with five rates (0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 t DM ha-1) of leaves of Dactyladenia barteri, two placement methods (incorporation and mulching), and two levels of Sokoto PR (0 and 60 kg P ha-1) in a split-split plot design replicated three times. The plant residues were applied 4 weeks before the main season planting. Maize (main season) followed by cowpea (minor season) was used as test plant. In the laboratory incubation study, addition of plant residues increased the soil pH. Phosphorus released at 8 weeks was greater for plant residues with high C/N ratio, and low magnesium and potassium. In the field trial, soil pH was not affected by the addition of plant residues. Residue placement method showed little effects on P availability from PR. When residues were incorporated with PR, soil Olsen P was highest at lower rates of residues (1 and 2 t DM ha -1) at maize planting. Maize P concentration and P uptake were highest at the incorporation of 4 t DM ha-1 residues with PR. Incorporation at higher rate (8 t DM ha-1) resulted in the greatest P uptake of the second crop, cowpea. The study shows the potential of plant residues in enhancing P release from PR. However, there could be initial immobilization of P, but this could be overcome within a short period if residues of high C/N ratio are used. A lower rate of residues (1-4 t DM ha -1) is efficient at releasing PR-P for short-term effect especially if incorporated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.#FRE#
