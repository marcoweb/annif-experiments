#ITI#Effect of phosphorus and sulphur application on growth, yield attributes and yield of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L)#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during the rabi season 2009-2010 to find out the optimum dose of phosphorus and sulphur on growth, yield attributes and yield of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L). Four levels of P2O5 (0, 20, 40 and 60 kg/ha) and three levels of sulphur (0, 20 and 40 kg/ha), applied through DAP and gypsum, respectively. Treatments were replicated three times in factorial randomized block design. Application of phosphorus from 0 to 60 kg /ha resulted in linear increase in various growth characters, yield attributing traits, seed and stalk yield of chickpea. The application of 60 kg P2O5 /ha produced the highest mean seed yield of 1761 (Kg/ ha) and stalk yield of 2754 (Kg/ha). Similarly the levels of sulphur up to 40 kg/ha showed linear increase the growth, yield attributes, seed and stalk yield of chickpea. The application of 40 kg Sulphur /ha produced the highest mean seed yield of 1665 (Kg/ha) and stalk yield of 2665 (Kg/ha).#FRE#
