#ITI#Response of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) varieties to irrigation and hydrogel application in vertisols#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted at Irrigation Water Management Research Centre (IWMRC) Belavatgi, Navalgund taluk of Dharwad district under Vertisols during rabi 2013-15 to study the effect of irrigation and hydrogel application on chickpea varieties in Malaprabha Command area. Irrigation effects were non significant, however irrigation scheduled at 0.4 IW/CPE + 2.5 kg ha-1hydrogel recorded higher grain yield (2136 kg ha-1) as compared to irrigation scheduled at 0.6 IW/CPE (2087 kg ha-1) and 0.4 IW/CPE (2025 kg ha-1). It also recorded significantly higher WUE (13.34 kg/ha mm) over 0.6 IW/CPE (8.15 kg/ha mm). Among the varieties ‘JG-11’ recorded significantly higher grain yields (2309 kg ha-1) over other varieties, however they did not affect the WUE. Interaction effect of irrigation levels and varieties was significant for grain yield and WUE. ‘A-1’, ‘JG-11’ and ‘JAKI-9218’ varieties with 2.5 kg ha-1hydrogel recorded significantly higher WUE and were on par. ‘JG-11’ variety with 0.6 IW/CPE recorded higher gross returns (Rs. 92660/ha), net returns (Rs. 69800/ha) and B:C ratio (3.05). © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
