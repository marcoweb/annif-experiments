#ITI#Biochemical targets affected by subacute doses of new pesticide mixtures tested on albino rats#FTI#
#IRE#Few studies have characterize the toxicological effects of exposure to pesticide mixtures. For this reason, the present study aimed to estimate the median lethal doses (LD50) of some new pesticide mixtures; chlorosan, feroban, cygron, engeo and kingbo on albino rats. The in vivo effect of these compounds on some biochemical targets were also investigated. The estimated median lethal doses (LD50) of chlorosan, feroban, engeo and cygron were 140.8, 264.0, 281.5 and 352.0 mg/kg body weight (b.w.), respectively. The estimated median lethal dose was more than 160.0 mg/kg b.w. in the case of kingbo. The symptoms of the affected animals included salivation, bleeding, activity increase and the chlorosan treated rats closed their eyes. Some animals died after doses of chlorosan, feroban and engeo administered at different intervals. The results showed a significant increase in the activities of plasma transaminases [Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (GOT) and Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (GPT)] and glutathione S-transferase (GST). It was found that the tested pesticides significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity 1 h after the last dose. Also, there was a significant increase in creatinine and urea levels. The obtained data concluded that chlorosan was the most effective against albino rats followed by feroban and engeo, while kingbo was the least effective. By the end of the experiment, the enzyme activities and kidney functions of animals treated with chlorosan, feroban and engeo did not return to normal.#FRE#
