#ITI#Effect of balanced fertilization on productivity and soil fertility status of clusterbean#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted on sandy clay loam soil during two kharif seasons of 2008 to 2009 to study the effect of balanced fertilization on productivity and soil fertility status of clusterbean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taubert]. The experiment, comprised of 3 treatments i.e. 100 % NPK, 100 % NPKS and 100 % NPKSZn, laid out in randomised block design with 9 replications. Results revealed that application of 100 % NPKSZN significantly enhanced the seed and straw yields of clusterbean by 29.5 and 29.6 per cent over 100 % NPK, respectively. This treatment also recorded significantly higher concentrations and uptake of N, P, K, S and Zn as well as improved the soil fertility status.#FRE#
