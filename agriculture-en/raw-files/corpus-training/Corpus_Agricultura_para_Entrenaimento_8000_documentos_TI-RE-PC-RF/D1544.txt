#ITI#Fertilization effects on yield sustainability and soil properties under irrigated wheat-soybean rotation of an Indian Himalayan upper valley#FTI#
#IRE#To date, the sustainability of wheat (Triticum aestivum)-soybean (Glycine max) cropping systems has not been well assessed, especially under Indian Himalayas. Research was conducted in 1995-1996 to 2004 at Hawalbagh, India to study the effects of fertilization on yield sustainability of irrigated wheat-soybean system and on selected soil properties. The mean wheat yield under NPK + FYM (farmyard manure) treated plots was ~27% higher than NPK (2.4 Mg ha-1). The residual effect of NPK + FYM caused ~14% increase in soybean yield over NPK (2.18 Mg ha-1). Sustainable yield index values of wheat and the wheat-soybean system were greater with annual fertilizer N or NPK plots 10 Mg ha-1 FYM than NPK alone. However, benefit:cost ratio of fertilization, agronomic efficiency and partial factor productivity of applied nutrients were higher with NPK + FYM than NPK, if FYM nutrients were not considered. Soils under NPK + FYM contained higher soil organic C (SOC), total soil N, total P and Olsen-P by ~10, 42, 52 and 71%, respectively, in the 0-30 cm soil layers, compared with NPK. Non-exchangeable K decreased with time under all treatments except NPK. Total SOC in the 0-30 cm soil layer increased in all fertilized plots. Application of NPK + FYM also improved selected soil physical properties over NPK. The NPK + FYM application had better soil productivity than NPK but was not as economical as NPK if farmers had to purchase manure. Â© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.#FRE#
