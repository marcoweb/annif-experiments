#IRE#Regular necropsy of samples of laying hen mortality at a large cage-layer ranch revealed significant loses due to osteoporosis. The feeding program consisted of feeding a pullet-growing diet until egg production commenced followed by a change to a laying diet. Literature review and experimental results have demonstrated a requirement for 2% dietary calcium for about 2 wk before first egg is anticipated followed by transfer to a higher calcium level during lay. A nutritional regimen of this design was tested on two paired sister flocks of hens. Necropsy of mortality during the tests showed a striking reduction in mortality due to osteoporosis.#FRE#
