#IRE#Studies on estimation of yield losses of groundnut due to major insect pests revealed that the highest pod (1367 kg/ha) and fodder (2947 kg/ha) yield as well as CBR of 1:6.51 was obtained in the plot sprayed with dimethoate 0.03%, chlorpyriphos 0.05 %, profenophos 0.05 % and profenophos 40 % + cypermethrin 4 % % 0.044% at 15 days interval starting from 20 days after sowing till harvest of the crop. The avoidable yield loss due to major insect pests of groundnut was recorded to the tune of 48.57 % in pod and 42.11 % in fodder in untreated control plot. The data on yield in protected plots revealed that 94.45 % additional yield in pod and 72.74 % additional yield in fodder could be realized over unprotected plots.#FRE#
