#ITI#Genotype x environment interaction for grain yield and its components in redgram [Cajanus cajan (L.) millsp]#FTI#
#IRE#Ten redgram genotypes were evaluated for their yield performance during three years (2007-2010) under rainfed conditions. The experiment was laidout in randomized block design with three replications. Significant genotypic differences for yield and yield components characters were observed. Significant genotype-environment interaction indicated differential responses of the genotypes to the environmental changes. The stability analysis was carried out, which showed significant linear component of variation for all the traits including yield. The genotype LRG 41 was most stable which showed higher grain yield, number of pods/plant and 100-seed weight, whereas PRG 158 was found stable for number of branches/plant and ICPL 85063 for plant height.#FRE#
