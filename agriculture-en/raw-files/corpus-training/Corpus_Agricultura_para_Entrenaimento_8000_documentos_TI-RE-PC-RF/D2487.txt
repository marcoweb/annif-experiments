#ITI#Effect of seed pelleting with botanicals on germination and seedling growth of clusterbean under induced saline condition#FTI#
#IRE#Cluster bean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub.] is an important legume crop. Investigations were undertaken to study the effect of seed pelleting with botanicals viz., Pongamia pinnata, Prosopis juliflora, Vitex nigundo and Albizia amara@ 50, 100, 150 and 200 g kg-1 of seed on germination and seedling growth of cluster bean under induced saline condition viz., EC4, EC8, EC12 and EC16. The experimental results revealed that increased salinity caused harmful effects on germination and seedling growth in terms of germination %, speed of germination, root length, shoot length, dry matter production and vigour index. However, pelleting treatments increased these parameters with more pronounced effect by Pongamia pinnata leaf powder. Higher germination, growth and vigour of seedlings were recorded with Pongamia pinnata leaf powder treatment @ 200 g per kg. The next best levels of vigour index was recorded in treatments with Pongamia pinnata leaf powder @ 150g per kg and Prosopis juliflora leaf powder @ 200g per kg only at no salinity and low levels and in high levels of salinity, Albizia amara leaf powder treatment @ 200g per kg performed as the nest best treatment.
