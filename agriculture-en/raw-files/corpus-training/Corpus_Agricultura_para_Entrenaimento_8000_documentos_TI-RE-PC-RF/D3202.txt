#ITI#Screening for Phosphorus (P) Acquisition Efficient Genotypes and Identification of Sequence Variations among P-Efficient and Inefficient Genotypes in Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Low phosphorus (P) availability is the major abiotic constraint in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) cultivation across the globe as well as in India. Present study contemplated to identify high P-acquisition efficient chickpea genotypes suitable for P-deficient regions and sequence variation was detected among the tested P-acquisition efficient and inefficient genotypes. Initial screening was conducted with 104 diverse chickpea genotypes at two locations characterized by P-sufficient and deficient conditions. A panel of 14 chickpea genotypes having contrasting P-acquisition efficiency was extracted for further assessment under P-sufficient and deficient conditions. Along with the significant genetic variations, the P-efficient chickpea genotypes had high P-acquisition efficiency than P-inefficient genotypes in both the conditions. P-acquisition efficient genotypes recorded high biomass and good yield potential in P-deficient condition in comparison to P-inefficient genotypes. Sequence analysis of the CaSPX3 domain containing protein gene from P-acquisition efficient and inefficient genotypes identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms in the 5¢-untranslated region. Present findings might be of great importance in future marker-assisted breeding in chickpea especially for P-deficient soil. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
