#ITI#Response of different yield components as selection criteria for yield and yield components in early generations of lentil (Lens culinaris L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Selected forty F2 single plant progenies of a lentil cross viz., L-830 × MC-6 and bulked seeds were evaluated in a randomized block design with two replications for secondary branches per plant, pods per plant, seed yield per plant and seed index as independent selection criteria. Out of the four selection criterion, highest realized selection response in percentage was recorded for pods per plant (37.42 %), and was followed by secondary branches per plant (28.5 %). The realized correlated response to selection for seed yield per plant was significant under the selection criteria number of pods per plant. Thus the selection criteria pods per plant was more effective than other selection criterion. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
