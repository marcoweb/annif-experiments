#ITI#Water requirement of drip irrigated tomatoes grown in greenhouse in tropical environment#FTI#
#IRE#Four different levels of drip fertigated irrigation equivalent to 100, 75, 50 and 25% of crop evapotranspiration (ET c), based on Penman-Monteith (PM) method, were tested for their effect on crop growth, crop yield, and water productivity. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, Troy 489 variety) plants were grown in a poly-net greenhouse. Results were compared with the open cultivation system as a control. Two modes of irrigation application namely continuous and intermittent were used. The distribution uniformity, emitter flow rate and pressure head were used to evaluate the performance of drip irrigation system with emitters of 2, 4, 6, and 8 l/h discharge. The results revealed that the optimum water requirement for the Troy 489 variety of tomato is around 75% of the ET c. Based on this, the actual irrigation water for tomato crop in tropical greenhouse could be recommended between 4.1 and 5.6 mm day -1 or equivalent to 0.3-0.4 l plant -1 day -1. Statistically, the effect of depth of water application on the crop growth, yield and irrigation water productivity was significant, while the irrigation mode did not show any effect on the crop performance. Drip irrigation at 75% of ET c provided the maximum crop yields and irrigation water productivity. Based on the observed climatic data inside the greenhouse, the calculated ET c matched the 75-80% of the ET c computed with the climatic parameters observed in the open environment. The distribution uniformity dropped from 93.4 to 90.6%. The emitter flow rate was also dropped by about 5-10% over the experimental period. This is due to clogging caused by minerals of fertilizer and algae in the emitters. It was recommended that the cleaning of irrigation equipments (pipe and emitter) should be done at least once during the entire cultivation period. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
