#ITI#Parallel increases in insect herbivory and defenses with increasing elevation for both saplings and adult trees of oak (Quercus) species#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Herbivory is predicted to increase toward warmer and more stable climates found at lower elevations, and this increase should select for higher plant defenses. Still, a number of recent studies have reported either no evidence of such gradients or reverse patterns. One source of inconsistency may be that plant ontogenetic variation is usually not accounted for and may influence levels of plant defenses and herbivory. Methods: We tested for elevational gradients in insect leaf herbivory and leaf traits putatively associated with herbivore resistance across eight oak (Quercus, Fagaceae) species and compared these patterns for saplings and adult trees. To this end, we surveyed insect leaf herbivory and leaf traits (phenolic compounds, toughness and nutrients) in naturally occurring populations of each oak species at low-, mid- or high-elevation sites throughout the Iberian Peninsula. Results: Leaf herbivory and chemical defenses (lignins) were unexpectedly higher at mid- and high-elevation sites than at low-elevation sites. In addition, leaf chemical defenses (lignins and condensed tannins) were higher for saplings than adult trees, whereas herbivory did not significantly differ between ontogenetic stages. Overall, elevational variation in herbivory and plant chemical defenses were consistent across ontogenetic stages (i.e., elevational gradients were not contingent upon tree ontogeny), and herbivory and leaf traits were not associated across elevations. Conclusions: These findings suggest disassociated patterns of elevational variation in herbivory and leaf traits, which, in turn, are independent of plant ontogenetic stage. © 2019 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
