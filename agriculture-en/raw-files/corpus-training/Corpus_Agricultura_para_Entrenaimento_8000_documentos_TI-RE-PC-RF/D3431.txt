#ITI#Effects of Titanium Dioxide on The Diseases, Development and Yield of Edible Cowpea#FTI#
#IRE#Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is being considered as a growth promoter that plays the function of antibiotics in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata Walp) production in Nigeria. Field trials were conducted at the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training, Moor Plantation, Ibadan, Nigeria in 2006 and 2007 to evaluate the influence/effect of TiO2 on the development yield and diseases of cowpea. Two treatments of TiO2 at 125 cc/ha significantly improved the development and yield and reduced the severity of foliar and pod diseases of cowpea compared to a single treatment at lower concentrations. Irrespective of the number of sprays and concentrations TiO2 increased the yield of cowpea by 8.74-36.11%, and 10.33-51.31% respectively, in both years. Â© 2008, Versita. All rights reserved.#FRE#
