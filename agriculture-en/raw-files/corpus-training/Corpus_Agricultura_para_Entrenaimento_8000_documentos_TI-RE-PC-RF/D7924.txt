#ITI#Interaction between soil water and fertilizer utilization on maize under plastic mulching in an arid irrigation region of China#FTI#
#IRE#Plastic film mulching (PM) has become a widely used cropping method in arid and semiarid areas. However, it is unknown how different PMs affect crop water and N utilization and their interaction under different N supplies. A two-year field experiment was conducted in the Hetao Irrigation District (HID), in northwest China. Following local irrigation practices, 500 mm border irrigation was used to grow spring maize over two growing seasons (2019 and 2020) with two N levels: high-N (225 kg N ha–1) and low-N (150 kg N ha–1). Combined with three mulching methods, the experiment had five treatments: (i) no mulching with high-N (control, CK), (ii) black plastic film with high-N (HB), (iii) transparent plastic film with high-N (HT), (iv) black plastic film with low-N (LB), and (v) transparent plastic film with low-N (LT). The 4 PM treatments had higher average soil water storage (0–120 cm) than CK. The PM treatments had the highest water consumption coefficients (Kwcn) at 6–leaf to 12–leaf stage (Kwc2) and milking to maturity (Kwc5) stage. The HP treatments (HB and HT) had higher soil nitrogen storage than CK during the growth period. Averaged across two seasons, HB and HT had 23.9%, 29.2% respectively, higher grain yields than CK. Averaged across two seasons, the transparent PM treatments had 7.49%, 5.31%, and 1.72% higher water use efficiency (WUE), partial factor productivity of nitrogen (PFPN), and harvest index, respectively, than the black PM treatments. The PM treatments showed the relationship between water use efficiency of biomass (WUEb) and nitrogen use efficiency of biomass (NUEb), with WUEb increased, NUEb also increased. Given these results, we recommend the high-N level and transparent PM for maize cropping to increase yield and resource utilization efficiency in the HID. © 2022#FRE#
