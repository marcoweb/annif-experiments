#IRE#Insights of antibiosis resistance in various chickpea cultivars against pod borer Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) under laboratory condtions. The present study was carried out in order to investigate the level of resistance against H. armigera on different cultivars by adopting detach leaf and pod assay. In leaf detach assay, pooled mean of 2012 and 2013, significantly lower and maximum weight gain and percent gain recorded was 101.9 mg (88.5%); 382.3mg (317.4%), respectively for ICCV 097105 and ICCV 07306. During podding stage, lowest pod damage (%) was recorded 55 % (ICCV 92944) and highest pod damage recorded by ICC 3137, LL 550 and ICCV07306 (95 %).Highest pupal weight of one day old pupae was recorded on LL 550 (405.2 mg) and lower pupal weight in ICCV 097105 (202.4 mg). The present result gave clue for future in depth studies on weeds for developing either specific pheromone compound or repellant compound for the ecofriendly management of H. armigera. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
