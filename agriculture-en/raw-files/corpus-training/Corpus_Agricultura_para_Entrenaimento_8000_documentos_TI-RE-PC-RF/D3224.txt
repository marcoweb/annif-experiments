#ITI#Effect of Seed Priming and Foliar Spraying of PGRs on Morpho-Physiology, Growth and Yield in Green gram (Vigna radiata L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Pre-sowing seed priming and foliar spraying with Plant Growth Regulators is an easy, low cost and low risk technique and also an alternative approach recently used to mitigate the effect of abiotic stresses in agricultural production. Methods: Seeds of Mung bean var. GAM-5 were primed and also foliar spraying at 30 DAS with CaCl2 2% and 1%, Cycocel 500, 1000 ppm, NAA 25, 50 ppm during summer season of 2015-16 and 2016-17. Result: The results indicated a significant improvement in morpho-physiological traits, growth parameters, biochemical constituents and thereby yield due to the application of PGRs. Seed priming with 2% CaCl2 followed by 1% foliar spraying at 30 DAS (T11) significantly improved most of morpho-physiological parameters viz., plant height, number of branches per plant, days to 50% flowering, maturity, leaf area, chlorophyll content, seed protein content, number of pods per plant, number of seeds per pod, test weight, pod length, yield per plant, yield per hectare, harvest index in green gram followed by the seed priming with Cycocel 1000 ppm followed by foliar spraying at 30 DAS (T13) and seed priming with NAA 50 ppm followed by foliar spraying at 30 DAS (T15). The treatment T11 was more efficient. Â© 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
