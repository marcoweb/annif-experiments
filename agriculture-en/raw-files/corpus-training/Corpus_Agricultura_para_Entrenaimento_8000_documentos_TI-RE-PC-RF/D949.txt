#ITI#Halopriming in the submergence-tolerant rice variety improved the resilience to salinity and combined salinity-submergence at the seedling stage#FTI#
#IRE#The role of halopriming in alleviating the detrimental effects of salinity and combined salinity-submergence was evaluated using two rice genotypes, “IR06F148” (anaerobic germination + submergence tolerant [Sub1]) and “Salt-star” (salt tolerant) with contrasting levels of tolerance. Nonprimed seeds and those primed with 1% calcium chloride (CaCl2) were germinated, and the seedlings were exposed to salinity (50 or 100 mM sodium chloride [NaCl]) and submergence (nonsaline or saline water). Salinity substantially inhibited plant height, shoot/root dry mass, and leaf area. Priming improved the resilience to 50 mM NaCl by increasing the chlorophyll content and lowering hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production; and to 100 mM NaCl by increasing the total soluble sugars. However, apparent differences in the responses of primed “Salt-star”, such as an increase in the Na+, K+, and Ca2+ levels, indicated that halopriming differentially affected the response to salt based on the salinity tolerance of the variety. Submergence reduced the shoot biomass, chlorophyll, and photosynthetic efficiency to a greater extent in “Salt-star” than in “IR06F148”. Priming, especially in “Salt-star”, caused a lesser reduction in the chlorophyll (Chl) and maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) but increased the total soluble sugars post-submergence, indicating a boost in the photosynthetic efficiency. The responses of the two varieties to submergence depended on their tolerance, and halopriming affected each variety differently. The metabolic and molecular changes induced by halopriming in submergence-tolerant rice may be explored further to understand the underlying mechanisms of improved resilience. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
