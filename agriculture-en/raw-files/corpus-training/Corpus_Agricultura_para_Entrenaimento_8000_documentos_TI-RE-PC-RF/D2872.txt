#ITI#Statistical approach to energy use efficiency of maize-urdbean intercropping system#FTI#
#IRE#Replicated values of energy use efficiency of different data sets were subjected to Anderson- Darling Normality Test and Shapiro-wilk test. Non significant result noticed between the data sets indicated analyses using regular analysis of variance (parametric). Analysis of variance of the values of energy use efficiency noticed to be non significant between the treatments in all the data sets. However, for maize it could be noticed that overall energy use efficiency is noticed to be better in Paired row of maize with two rows of urdbean, which recorded energy use efficiency value 11.56 compared to 11.26 and 11.00 of 2:1 and 1:1 row ratio respectively.#FRE#
