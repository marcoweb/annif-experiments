#ITI#Symbiotic association between golden berry (Physalis peruviana) and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in heavy metal-contaminated soil#FTI#
#IRE#Physalis peruviana is one of the most promising tropical fruit plants because of its rapid growth, high yield, and nutritional quality. This study was designed to investigate plant development under heavy metal contamination (Cd, Pb) and responsiveness to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization by Rhizophagus clarum and Claroideoglomus claroideum. The antioxidant capacity, total lipid content and fatty acid profile in fruits, accumulation of Cd and Pb in different plant parts, plant dry biomass, and mycorrhizal colonization were determined. As a result of inoculation, a considerable reduction in Cd and Pb in the fruits was observed, compared with non-inoculated plants. The fruit number and dry weight increased in plants associated with C. claroideum. These plants also showed higher acid phosphatase activity, root protein accumulation and glomalin production. The type of antioxidant defense was AMF strain-dependent. Antioxidant activity and H2O2 neutralization were enzymatic rather than non-enzymatic processes in the fruits of C. claroideum plants compared with those forming an association with R. clarum. Mycorrhizal establishment changed the composition and concentration of fruits' fatty acids. The ratio of unsaturated fatty acids was increased. With respect to the accumulation of bioactive compounds in golden berry the present findings are important for obtaining the optimum benefits of mycorrhizal association under unfavorable conditions.
