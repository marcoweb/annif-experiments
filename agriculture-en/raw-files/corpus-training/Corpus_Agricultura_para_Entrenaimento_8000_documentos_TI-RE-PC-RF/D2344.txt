#ITI#Determination of the mineralization of nitrogen from composted chicken manure as affected by temperature#FTI#
#IRE#Incubations at 5, 10 or 20°C of composted chicken manure in a sand, clay or loam soil consistently released nitrogen. A statistical model fitted to the data confirmed that the temperature dependence followed an Arrhenius pattern. The data were used to test the hypothesis that composted manure behaves more like native soil organic matter than fresh residues and this idea is illustrated with the use of a computer simulation model. Extrapolation of the model results in several climates suggests that about 40% of the organic N in composted chicken manure becomes available to crops during the first year and 6-12% during each subsequent year. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
