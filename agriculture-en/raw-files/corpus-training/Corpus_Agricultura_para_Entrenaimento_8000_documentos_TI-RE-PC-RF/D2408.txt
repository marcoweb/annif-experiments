#ITI#Maize nitrogen uptake and productivity under reduced and conventional tillage#FTI#
#IRE#Reduced tillage (RT) systems have been promoted for crop production intensification in low potential areas through enhancement of fertiliser response of degraded soils and drought mitigation. A 3 year study was conducted from 2015/2016 to 2017/2018 growing seasons in sub-humid (650–1000 mm rainfall year−1) Zimbabwe to determine nitrogen (N) uptake and maize yield response to nitrogen fertilisation rate (0, 30, 60, 90 120 150, 180 k gha−1) under RT and conventional tillage (CT). The experimental design was a split plot, with the two tillage systems as main plot and seven N rates as the sub-plot treatments. Four sites were established in smallholder farmer fields with clayey soils (160–400 g clay kg−1; Chromic Luvisols and Rhodic Ferralsols) and sandy soils (40–100 g clay kg−1; Eutric Regosols). Results show that the study sites had rainfall deficits of 4–47% in the first and third growing seasons. Nitrogen uptake rates of 8–60 kg ha−1 resulted in fertiliser N recovery efficiencies of 5–40% which were two fold higher under RT than under CT system. Maize grain yields (0.3–11 t ha−1) were 33% higher under RT than CT and increased 1.88–2.72 fold under N fertilisation compared to the control. The mismatch between top dressed N and peak crop demand require precision fertilisation in the dry seasons. Agroecology based quadratic modelling revealed that maximum maize yields of 2–13 t ha−1 were obtainable at optimum N fertilisation rates that were lower under RT than CT. The study provided a robust starting point in the improvement of nitrogen fertiliser management for maize under reduced tillage and climate variability. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
