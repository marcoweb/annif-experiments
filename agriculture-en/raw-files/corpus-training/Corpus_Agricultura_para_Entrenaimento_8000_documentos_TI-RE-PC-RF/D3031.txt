#ITI#The effects of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria on antioxidant activity in chickpea (Cicer arietinum l.) under salt stress#FTI#
#IRE#In chickpea soil salinity is one of the most important factors affecting yield, nodulation and physiological events. Salinity affects the growth of salt sensitive varieties. The inoculation of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) allows to reduce the harmful effects of salinity. To prevent adverse effects of chickpea salinity, the effects of four bacteria (Rhizobium ciceri, A-08, EB-80 and Isolate-30) in root rhizosphere under controlled environmental growth conditions were studied. This study has shown that PGPRs play an important role in growth regulators for the positive development of plants under salt stress. It has been observed that these isolates, common in roots, are tolerant to salinity antioxidant activity and an increase in proline, MDA, APX, SOD and CAT concentrations were found under saline conditions when unvaccinated plants were compared with grafted plants. The results also suggested that inoculated PGPR strains can reduce salinity stress by increasing salt tolerance. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
