#ITI#Effect of irrigation and phosphorus levels on broad bean (Vicia faba L.) for improving growth, yield and water extraction pattern#FTI#
#IRE#The experiment was carried out during 2009-10 and 2010-11 rabi seasons to find out the effect of irrigation and phosphorus doses on growth, yield and water extraction of broad bean. Crop irrigated at Y = -0.03 MPa at 30 cm soil depth showed 5.33% and 34.97% higher seed yield compared to Ψ = -0.05 MPa at 30 cm soil depth and rainfed, respectively and was significantly superior. Treatment receiving 75 kg P2O5/ha was significantly superior with 5.33 t/ha seed yield which was 8.33% and 28.74% higher over 50 kg P2O5/ha and 25 kg P2O5/ha, respectively. Growth and yield attributing characters also followed the trend of seed yield. Irrigation applied at Y = -0.03 MPa at 30 cm soil depth markedly enhanced nodule number, net return (Rs. 32200.98/ha) and benefit cost ratio (2.32) over other irrigation treatments. Among different P levels the highest nodule number, net return (Rs. 36834.22/ha) and benefit cost ratio (1.32) were recorded with the application of 75 kg P2O5/ha. The study revealed that, Soil moisture extraction by the crop increased with the advancement of crop growing period and again it decreased till harvest. Moisture extraction rate increased with the increase in moisture status of the soil. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
