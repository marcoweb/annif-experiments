#ITI#Organic amendments affect biochemical properties of a subtemperate soil of the Indian Himalayas#FTI#
#IRE#Evaluation of suitable organic amendments is prerequisite for sustainable agricultural growth in the northwestern Himalayan ecosystem. The effect of organic amendment applications on the activity of exocellular enzymes were examined on a silty clay loam soil of a subtemperate hill-agro ecosystem. The treatments involved addition of equivalent amounts of N through mineral fertilizer (MF) and two organic inputs, composted cattle manure (CM) and vermicomposts (VC), at four different doses. Soil enzymatic activities and fertility at crop harvest were measured after continuous 3 years of application, and its residual effects were also studied. In comparison with the control, CM and VC addition increased soil organic carbon (OC) by 54% and 52% at application rate equivalent to recommended dose, respectively, whereas there was a 12% increase following MF treatment. Bulk density of CM- and VC-treated soil were 1.16 and 1.14 Mg m-3, respectively, compared with 1.32 Mg m -3 in control after 3 years. Dehydrogenase activity was higher in the CM treatments by 44-204%, and by 22-108% in VC treatments than in control. The addition of CM and VC caused different responses in hydrolase enzymes. Protease and cellulase activity increased in both organic treatments significantly across treatments. However, urease and alkaline phosphatase activity was more influenced by application of CM compared with VC. β-glucosidase activity was higher in MF treatment and was at par with the highest rate of organic amendment application. Increase in phosphatase activity is attributed to soil pH and microbial stimulation by organic C and is correlated with the increase in dehydrogenase activity (R 2 = 0.923). Differences in activities of all evaluated enzymes were narrowed down in residual treatments compared with control without much change in the trend. Composted CM was found more suitable for sustaining quality of subtemperate soils. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
