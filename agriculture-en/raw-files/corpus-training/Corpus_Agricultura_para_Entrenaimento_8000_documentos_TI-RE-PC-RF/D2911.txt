#ITI#Effect of Spacing and Fertigation on Growth and Yield Parameters of French Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) under Protected Cultivation#FTI#
#IRE#Background: French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is an important and widely grown leguminous vegetable. The area under this crop in protected cultivation is increasing due to its high yield and remunerative price. There is scanty of information on pacing and nutrients for fertigation under protected cultivation. Hence the experiment was carried out to determine the effect of spacing and fertigation on growth and yield parameters in French bean under naturally ventilated polyhouse during Kharif 2018 at Zonal Agricultural and Horticultural Research Station, Navile, Shivamogga. Methods: The experiment was laid out in split plot design with three replications. There were 18 treatment combinations comprised of three different spacing treatments and six fertigation treatments. Result: Among all the treatments significantly highest number of primary branches (8.70) and secondary branches (8.50) at 45 days after sowing (DAS), number of pods plant-1 (220.20), pod length (20.66 cm), pod girth (2.95 cm) and pod weight (17.69g) were recorded in the treatment combination with 60 × 75 cm with 44:70:53 kg ha-1 + mulching + micronutrient spray. The least number of primary branches (4.27), secondary branches (4.50), number of pods plant-1 (160.33), pod length (15.61cm), pod girth (1.75 cm) and pod weight (13.88g) were observed in the treatment combination with 60 × 45 cm spacing with 33:52.5:39.75 kg of N:P:K kg ha-1. The higher plant height at 45 DAS (480.50 cm) and yield (13.06 t) for 1000 m-2 was found in treatment combination 60 × 45 cm with 44:70:53 kg ha-1 + mulching + micronutrient spray (S3 T4). It was concluded from the study that, the closer spacing (60 × 45 cm) with the combination of 44:70:53 kg ha-1 (N:P:K), mulching and micronutrient spray resulted in higher pod yield (13.06 t) 1000 m-2. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
