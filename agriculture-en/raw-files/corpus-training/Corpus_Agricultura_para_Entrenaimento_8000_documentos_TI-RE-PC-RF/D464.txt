#ITI#Traits variation of acorns and cupules during maturation process in Quercus variabilis and Quercus aliena#FTI#
#IRE#Quercus variabilis and Quercus aliena are two native tree species in China, which have similar habitats, and their regeneration mainly depends on acorn dispersal. This study analyzed the contents of water, soluble sugar, starch, soluble protein, and total phenolics in acorns and cupules during the whole development process to explore the difference between species. Thereinto, starch and total phenol occupied the dominant roles as their high contents. The acorn starch contents increased sharply during development in both species, but the contents in Q. variabilis were almost twice those of Q. aliena when mature. Similarly, high expression levels of starch synthase, soluble starch synthase 2 (SSS2) were also found in the acorns of Q. variabilis. The total phenol contents in Q. variabilis acorns were high at the early stages, and decreased sharply to similar contents in Q. aliena when mature. Additionally, the cupules in Q. variabilis had high contents of total phenols during the whole development period. Similar trends were also found in the expression patterns of UGT84A13 and SDH. The high total phenols in acorns and cupules of Q. variabilis probably protect the acorns from Mechoris ursulus, as only Q. aliena suffered a severe pest infestation in the early development stages. This study not only clarifies the interspecific difference between storage and defense substances during the development process in acorns and cupules, but also deepens understanding the specialized mechanisms of plant–pest/animal interactions in Quercus. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
