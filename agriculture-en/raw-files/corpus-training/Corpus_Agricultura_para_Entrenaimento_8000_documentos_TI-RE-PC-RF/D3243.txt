#ITI#Management of dry root rot [macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi.) goid] of mungbean (vigna radiata l.) through bioagents and bio-fertilizer in vivo#FTI#
#IRE#Bio-control agents and bio-fertilizer minimized the root rot incidence, increased percent inhibition, increased grain yield and nodulation in mungbean significantly as compared to control. The minimum 13.50% disease incidence, maximum 79.23% inhibition of dry root rot, maximum grain yield of 14.8q/ha and maximum 24 nodules/plant were observed in the treatment T13. Where T. harzianum in combination with Rhizobium was used as seed treatment and soil application followed by the treatment (T14) where P. fluorescens was used in combination with Rhizobium (18.50% disease incidence, 71.54% disease inhibition,13.4q/ha grain yield and 21 nodules/ plant. used as seed treatment and soil application.
