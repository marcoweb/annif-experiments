#ITI#Application of natural and synthetic growth promoters improves the productivity and quality of quinoa crop through enhanced photosynthetic and antioxidant activities#FTI#
#IRE#Modern agriculture is primarily concerned with enhanced productivity of field crops linked with maximum resources use efficiency to feed the increasing population of the world. Exogenous application of biostimulants is considered a sustainable and ecofriendly approach to improve the growth and productivity of agronomic and horticultural field crops. The present study was carried out to explore the comparative growth enhancing potential of plant biostimulants (moringa leaf extract at 3% and sorghum water extract at 3%) and synthetic growth promoters (ascorbic acid at 500 μM and hydrogen peroxide at 100 μM) on growth, productivity and quality of quinoa crop (cultivar UAF-Q7) because it has gained significant popularity among agricultural scientists and farmers throughout the world due to its high nutritional profile. A field experiment was carried out at the Research Area of Directorate of Farms, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad, Pakistan during quinoa cultivation season of 2016–2017 and repeated during next year (2017–2018). All the foliar treatments enhanced the physiological, biochemical, quality, growth and yield attributes of quinoa as compared to control group. However, maximum improvement was observed in chlorophyll a and b contents, photosynthesis and respiration rates, and water use efficiency by moringa leaf extract (MLE) application. MLE application was also found more responsive regarding the improvement in activities of peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, phenolics and glycine betaine as compared to other treatments. Mineral elements i.e. K, Ca and N in root as well as in shoot were found the highest in response to MLE application. Similarly, growth (plant fresh and dry biomass, plant length and grain yield) and grain quality parameters (protein, K and Ca) were also significantly enhanced. Application of MLE was found to be a viable approach to improve the growth and quality of produce as compared to synthetic compounds. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
