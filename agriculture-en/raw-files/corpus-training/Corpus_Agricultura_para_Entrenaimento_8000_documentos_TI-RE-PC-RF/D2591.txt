#ITI#Response of Blackgram (Vigna mungo L.) and Soybean (Glycine max L.) to Novel Bio Stimulants in North Eastern Dry Zone of Karnataka#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The objective of modern agriculture includes environmental sustainability, low production costs and higher productivity. A biostimulant is a plant material or any other organic compound that not only improves the nutritional aspects also enhances the yield of crops. Black gram and soybean crops of immense economic significance. The growth and yield of these crops are limited by supply of nutrients. Biostimulants consists of amino acids and peptides which helps in growth and development of crops. Methods: The field experiment conducted with randomized complete block design and 4 replications. Effects of different biostimulants at different concentrations as foliar spray and seed treatment for both crops were examined on growth, yield parameters and yield of black gram (TAU-1) and soybean (JS-335) was carried out during kharif 2020. Result: Results showed that foliar application of Quantis biostimulant @ 5 ml L-1 recorded higher growth, yield parameters and seed yield (922 kg ha-1), biological yield (1245 kg ha-1) and production efficiency (13.36 kg day-1 ha-1) in black gram and seed treatment with Epivio energy @ 200 ml 100 kg-1 fetched higher seed yield (1439 kg ha-1), biological yield (1535 kg ha-1) and production efficiency (2974 kg day-1 ha-1) along with higher growth, yield parameters in soybean. It can be concluded that biostimulants will help in achieving higher growth and yield of black gram and soybean. Â© 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
