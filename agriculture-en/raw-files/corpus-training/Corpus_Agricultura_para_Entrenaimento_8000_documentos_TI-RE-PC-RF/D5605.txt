#ITI#Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 associated with outbreaks of infectious hydropericardium in Haryana, India#FTI#
#IRE#During 1998, hydropericardium syndrome was observed among 3-to-6-wk-old broilers in 45 different flocks of Haryana, India, with mortality ranging between 10% and 30%. Fowl adenovirus (FAV) was isolated from one of the affected flocks by chicken embryo liver cell culture. Serum neutralization test and polymerase chain reaction assay coupled with restriction enzyme analysis confirmed that the isolated virus belonged to FAV serotype 4. The disease was reproduced in 28-day-old broilers by subcutaneous and oral inoculation of isolated FAV4 alone. Typical hydropericardium and basophilic intranuclear inclusions in hepatocytes were observed in experimental birds by day 4 postinoculation.#FRE#
