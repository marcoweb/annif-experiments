#ITI#Dose-dependent physiological effects of UV-C radiation on seashore paspalum#FTI#
#IRE#Positive effects of ultraviolet-C (UV–C) radiation on plants have been documented in previous literature with a focus on extending shelf life and reducing disease development. However, its effect on plant growth habits has been scarcely explored, especially in turfgrass where a compact shoot growth is a desirable trait. Seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum) is a warm-season perennial turfgrass requiring low fertilizer and pesticide inputs. This project aimed to test the effects of different doses of UV-C radiation on growth and performance of seashore paspalum cv. Seastar. Here, we provide evidence of dose-dependent effects. Lower UV-C doses (6 s and 1 min daily) improved the performance of seashore paspalum, as manifested by higher tiller density, reduced clipping yields, increased chlorophyll level on selected dates as well as enhanced photosynthetic efficiency compared to control. Contrastingly, higher doses (6 min and 30 min daily) resulted in severe damage with 30-min treatment being lethal to seashore paspalum, causing marked declines in all measured parameters. This is the first time that UV-C-induced growth response was reported in turf. Conclusions drawn from this study would shed light into the effects of UV-C radiation on the growth and performance of seashore paspalum and offer exciting potential for the utilization of UV-C at non-lethal dosage in turfgrass management. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
