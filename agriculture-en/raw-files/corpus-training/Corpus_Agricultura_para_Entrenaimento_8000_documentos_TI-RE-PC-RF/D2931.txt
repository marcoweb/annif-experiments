#ITI#Seed treatments for vigorous seedling establishment and improved seed yield of blackgram under rice fallow condition#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was conducted to produce potential seedlings and sustained seed yield of blackgram under rice fallow cultivation. Initially, the seeds were treated with different treatment combinations include polymer, microorganisms and micronutrients and subsequently were screened under invitro and pot culture experiments. Results of the both experiments revealed the superiority of 40 % liquid Pseudomonas soaking for 3 hrs. + Polymer @ 3g kg-1 over other treatments. Forwarded field study along with different sowing methods also showed the superiority of the above treatment by recording maximum seed yield per plant (15.4 g), per plot (1.66 kg/30 m2) and per hectare (553 kg). Among the sowing methods, seeds sown at 7 days before paddy harvest (S1) were recorded significantly maximum seed yield per plant (14.1g), per plot (1.57 kg) and per hectare (523 kg). In conclusion, seeds could be treated with 40 % liquid Pseudomonas soaking for 3 hr + Polymer @ 3g kg-1 and sown at 7 to 4 days before harvest of paddy to obtain the sustained higher seed yield under rice fallow condition.
