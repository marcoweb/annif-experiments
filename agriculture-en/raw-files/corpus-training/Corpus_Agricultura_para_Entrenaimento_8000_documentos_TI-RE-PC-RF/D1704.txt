#ITI#Long-term K fertilization effects on soil available K, grain yield, and plant K critical value in winter wheat#FTI#
#IRE#This study takes advantage of Swiss long-term field experiments (> 30 yrs) with different K fertilization rates at three sites to (i) test the possibility to generalize linear relationships between K extracts (ammonium acetate, K-AA; ammonium acetate EDTA, K-AAE; water, K-H2O; and water saturated with CO2, K-CO2), (ii) determine the K fertilization effect on soil exchangeable K, (iii) determine the K fertilization effect on shoot biomass and grain yield of winter wheat, (iv) analyze the possibility to derive a soil K critical value, and (v) determine a critical plant K (Kc) dilution curve as a function of shoot biomass (SB) using a “classical” and a Bayesian method. Shoot biomass during the growing season, grain yield, and four soil extracts were measured in 2018 after more than 30 years with four to five rates of K fertilization. Unpublished data of soil K-AAE concentrations, and grain yield and K concentrations since the start of the experiments were also used to analyze the relationship between soil K-AAE and the cumulative K budget. The K-AA and K-AAE concentrations can be converted from one to the other [K-AAE = 26.8 + (1.11 × K − AA)], while the relationship between K-H2O and K-CO2 depends on soil pH. The K-AAE concentrations were positively related to the cumulative K budget for K-AAE ranges from a minimal K concentration up to a K holding capacity that were specific to each site. The lack of K fertilization during several decades decreased shoot biomass in 2018 and grain yield over the course of the experiments at only one of the three sites. The K-AAE values corresponding to non-limiting soil K conditions at this site (50—75 mg K kg−1) were close to the critical values previously reported but the large range suggests that more soil parameters should be taken into account to improve the accuracy of the fertilization guidelines. The Bayesian and “classical” methods used for estimating the Kc curve yielded similar results (Kc = 58.21 × SB−0.45) that should be confirmed in future studies under a range of pedoclimatic conditions along with the effect of other nutrients and wheat cultivars. © 2022, The Author(s).#FRE#
