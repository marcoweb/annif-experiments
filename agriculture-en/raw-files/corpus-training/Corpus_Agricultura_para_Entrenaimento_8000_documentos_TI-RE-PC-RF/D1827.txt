#ITI#A short communication on the effect of nitrogen fertilization of willow on yield, combustion emissions and greenhouse gas balance#FTI#
#IRE#Nitrogen fertilizer was applied to willow after harvest in 2011, two levels of nitrogen were applied (75; 150 kg N/ha) in addition to a control. The trial was harvested in January 2013, biomass from each treatment was burnt and emissions from combustion were quantified. Nitrogen application increased leaf nitrogen and plant height although there was no difference between the nitrogen treatments. Plant height and maximum stem diameter increased with applied nitrogen at final harvest. Nitrogen fertilization significantly increased yield by 35 % although there was no difference between the two nitrogen treatments. Stem nitrogen content did not differ significantly between treatments and there was no significant difference in NOx emissions between treatments. A life cycle assessment showed that nitrogen fertilization significantly increased net greenhouse gas benefit by up to 30 % depending on the fuel replaced. The study demonstrated that the application of relatively low levels of nitrogenous fertilizer to willow can significantly improve greenhouse gas mitigation without affecting other aspects of the environment such as air quality.
