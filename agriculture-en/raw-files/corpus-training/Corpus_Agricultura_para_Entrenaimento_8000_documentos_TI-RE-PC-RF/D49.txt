#ITI#Physiological and molecular response of colored wheat seedlings against phosphate deficiency is linked to accumulation of distinct anthocyanins#FTI#
#IRE#Anthocyanin rich colored wheat with additional health benefits has created interest among breeders, consumers and policy makers to address the prevailing malnutrition in the vulnerable population. Researchers are exploring how colored wheat could perform under different nutrient conditions for the maintenance of growth and development. The present study was aimed to investigate the differential response of phosphorous (Pi) deficiency at the seedling stage using hydroponics. Our results showed that Pi-deficiency triggered typical response in the wheat along with the changes in the plant root morphology, total biomass, micronutrient concentration and distinct anthocyanin accumulation. Our physiological and biochemical data revealed that these parameters were positively altered under stress in the colored wheat and the adaptation followed the trend of white < blue <purple < black. Our results also confirmed that stress induced accumulation of distinct anthocyanins including derivatives of cyanidin, delphinidin and peonidin in a genotype dependent manner. Differential expression pattern visualized for the transcripts encoding phosphate transporters, anthocyanin biosynthesis, putative transporters and regulators may be one of the underlying factors. Altogether, our data showed that the black wheat genotype with highest anthocyanin content could able to adapt better with the P stress. This study will help in identifying suitable colored wheat adapting the stress condition and have potential for influence on the future agricultural cultivation practices. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
