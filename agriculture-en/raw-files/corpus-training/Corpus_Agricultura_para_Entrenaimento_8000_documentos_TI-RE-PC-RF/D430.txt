#ITI#Relationship between photosystem activity and ultraweak luminescence excitation in Cerasus humilis leaves under salt stress#FTI#
#IRE#Cerasus humilis (Bge.) Sok (C. humilis) is a wild fruit tree endemic to China. It mainly grows on saline land and often suffers from osmotic stress. Biophotons are ultraweak luminescence (UWL) radiations that are closely related to various biological processes and activities. UWL emission essentially originates from the oxidative stress process of organisms. However, it is unclear whether UWL production is related to the redox state of chloroplasts. Therefore, to understand the UWL emission mechanism in plants, we studied the effect of salt stress on the photosystem (PS) activity and UWL of C. humilis leaves and analyzed the correlation between PS activity and UWL. The results showed that salt stress severely inhibited the PS activity of C. humilis leaves and oxygen-evolving complex, damaged the integrity of the thylakoid membrane, decreased the photochemical efficiency of PSII, and hindered the QA-QB electron transfer. At the same time, the intensity of UWL also decreased. Further, correlation analyses of PS activity indices and UWL showed that UWL was significantly correlated with main parameters of photosystem activity such as PSII the maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and photosynthetic performance index based on absorbed light energy (PIABS), as well as the absorption, capture, and transfer of energy in the unit reaction center and unit leaf section. These results indicated that the PS activity of C. humilis was related to the production of UWL, and the intensity of UWL decreased with the decrease in PS activity. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
