#ITI#Diversity Analysis for Seed Yield and its Component Traits among Faba Bean (Vicia faba L.) Germplasm Lines#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is one of the oldest cool season food legume crops, stands next to soybean (Glycine max L.) and pea (Pisum sativum L.). A throughout knowledge of existing genetic variation among seed yield and its component traits is essential for developing high yielding varieties in faba bean. Realizing the importance of genetic diversity in key economic traits, the present investigation planned to assess the genetic diversity in faba bean germplasm for yield improvement in faba bean breeding programme. Methods: The experimental material comprised of 80 faba bean germplasm lines, grown in RBD with three replications at Research Farm of Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding, CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar during Rabi 2015-16. The data on 10 quantitative traits was analysed for Mahalanobis D2 statistic, stepwise multiple regression and principle component analysis (PCA). Result: The present study has assessed the existed genetic variations traits among faba bean germplasm lines for seed yield and its component traits. This would certainly provide guidelines in the selection of parents as well as effective selection of promising faba bean genotypes in faba bean breeding programmes for developing high yielding varieties.
