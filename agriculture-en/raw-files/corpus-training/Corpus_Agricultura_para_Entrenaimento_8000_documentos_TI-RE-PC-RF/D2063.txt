#ITI#Long-term effect of continuous cropping of irrigated rice on soil and yield trends in the Sahel of West Africa#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of 18 years continuous cropping of irrigated rice on soil and yields were studied in two long-term fertility experiments (LTFE) at Ndiaye and Fanaye in the Senegal River Valley (West Africa). Rice was planted twice in a year during the hot dry season (HDS) and wet season (WS) with different fertilizer treatments. Soil organic carbon (SOC) under fallow varied from 7.1 g kg-1 at Fanaye to 11.0 g kg-1 at Ndiaye. Rice cropping maintained and increased SOC at Ndiaye and Fanaye, respectively and fertilizer treatments did not affect SOC. Soil available P and exchangeable K were maintained or increased with long-term application of NPK fertilizers. Without any fertilizer, yields decreased by 60 kg ha-1 (1.5%) and 115 kg ha-1 (3%) per year at Fanaye and Ndiaye, respectively. The highest annual yield decreases of 268 kg ha-1 (3.6%) and 277 kg ha-1 (4.1%) were observed at Fanaye and Ndiaye, respectively when only N fertilizer was applied. Rice yields were only maintained with NPK fertilizers supplying at least 60 kg N, 26 kg P and 50 kg K ha-1. It was concluded that the double cropping of irrigated rice does not decrease SOC and the application of the recommended doses of NPK fertilizer maintained rice yields for 18 years. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
