#ITI#Subsurface drip irrigation reduces CH4 emissions and ecosystem respiration compared to surface drip irrigation#FTI#
#IRE#Sustainable irrigation expansion is pivotal to guarantee global food security. Fertigation techniques with surface or subsurface drip lines are among the most promising irrigation practices. Yet, the effect of surface versus subsurface drip fertigation on ecosystem respiration (CO2) fluxes remains largely unknown while there is not available information regarding CH4 emissions, even though this knowledge is essential to obtain a comprehensive overview of the carbon (C) footprint of these practices. To address this knowledge gap, a field experiment was set up in a maize (Zea mays L.) crop comparing surface and subsurface drip (buried at 30 cm depth) in combination with four fertilization treatments (unfertilized control, calcium nitrate and ammonium sulphate with or without the nitrification inhibitor DMPP). Our results showed that all fertilized treatments (except the unfertilized control) were net CH4 sources (135–208 g C ha−1). Subsurface irrigation reduced cumulative CH4 emissions compared to surface irrigation by 80% (P < 0.05). Moreover, subsurface irrigation also abated ecosystem respiration fluxes (by 41%, P < 0.05) relative to surface irrigation. Emission peaks of both C fluxes were observed after fertigation events. Our results demonstrate that subsurface irrigation is a water-saving strategy that can contribute to decreasing the net greenhouse gas emissions of irrigated croplands through the abatement of CH4 and respiration fluxes. © 2023 The Authors#FRE#
