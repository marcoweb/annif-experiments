#ITI#Influence of stage of harvesting and zinc application on yield and zinc uptake in cluster bean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) TAUB]#FTI#
#IRE#The field experiment entitled, “Influence of stage of harvesting and zinc application on yield and zinc uptake in cluster bean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba L.)” was conducted during Kharif 2016 at Forage Research Farm, Agronomy Section, ICAR-National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, Haryana. The experiment was laid out in split plot design with three replications. The main plot treatments comprised of four stages of harvesting [50, 60, 70 and 80 DAS] and under sub plot treatments four levels of Zinc application (Control, 10 kg ZnSO4,20 kg ZnSO and 0.5 % Zinc spray at 30 DAS) were 4 taken. The soil of the experimental field was sandy clay loam in texture with neutral pH, low in available nitrogen and zinc, medium in available phosphorus and higher in available potassium. The growth parameters viz. plant height, leaf length, number of leaves, stem girth and leaf: stem ratio were significantly higher at 80 DAS over other harvesting stages. In sub plot treatments application of zinc through zinc sulphate @ 20 kgha-1 significantly improved all growth parameters except stem girth over other treatments. Positive interaction effect was recorded between Stage of harvesting and zinc application for stem girth and plant height. Highest plant height was recorded under treatment combination of 80 DAS and zinc application @ 20 kg ha-1over other harvesting date and zinc level combinations. A significant increase in green fodder yield (GFY) and dry matter yield (DMY) was obtainedup to harvest at 80 DAS and zinc application @ 20 kg ha-1whereas significantly highest OM content was recorded at 50 DAS (Day after sowing). Maximum zinc uptake was noticed at 80 DAS stage and application rate of 20 kg ZnSO4 ha-1 among other treatments. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
