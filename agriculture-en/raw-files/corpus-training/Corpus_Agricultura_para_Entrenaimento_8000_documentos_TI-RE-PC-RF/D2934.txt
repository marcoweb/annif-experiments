#ITI#Biochemical and physiological studies on rhizobium inoculated chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) cultivar grown in eastern Uttar Pradesh#FTI#
#IRE#Health promoting biochemical parameters of fifteen distinct chickpea cultivar (Desi and Kabuli) showed wide variability in their biochemical and physiological composition, malic acid content, days to 50% flowering, primary branches per plant, number of pods per plant. Malic acid content polled mean ranged from 0.40 to 0.49 % in control, rhizobium inoculated 0.46 to 0.54% and 0.42 to 0.50% in control, rhizobium inoculated 0.49 to 0.54 % at 45 DAS and 90 DAS respectively, pooled mean primary branches per plant in different genotypes ranged from 4.45 to 5.70 in control and 4.90 to 6.45 in rhizobium inoculated chickpea genotypes, days to 50% flowering in chickpea ranged from 75.00-87.00 days in control, rhizobium inoculated 75.00-86.00 days, number of pods per plant in chickpea ranged from 21.98-62.91 in control, rhizobium inoculated 26.85-73.02. The research result about the biochemical characteristics of control and rhizobium inoculated chickpea genotypes are expected to provide guidelines for the researches confronted with the need to use such typical food seed in India as well as in the rest of the world.
