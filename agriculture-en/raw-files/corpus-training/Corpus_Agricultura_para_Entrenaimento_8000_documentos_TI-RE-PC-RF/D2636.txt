#ITI#Nodule Occupancy Behaviour of Bacteriocinogenic Rhizobium spp. in Mungbean (Vigna radiata)#FTI#
#IRE#A pot culture study was undertaken to determine the synergistic effect of bacteriocinogenic Rhizobium spp. (N8, S1, S6 and S13 isolated from Mungbean fields) with Indicator Rhizobium spp. (mungbean biofertilizer) in terms of nodulation, plant growth traits and grain yield in Mungbean (SML 668). Dual inoculation of bacteriocinogenic Rhizobium isolates N8 with indicator strain (indicator+N8) resulted significant increase in number of nodules (24.3 nn/plant), nodule index (1.36), nodule dry weight (23.4mg/plant), dry weight of shoot (0.79g/plant), dry weight of root (1.65g/plant), chlorophyll content (1.34mg/g of leaves), leghemoglobin content (3.43mg/g of nodules), number of pods (15.9/plant), number of seeds (13.8/pods), seed set percent (86.73%), plant height (96cm), yield (1.69g/ plant), Nitrogen content of grains (4.02%) as compared to indicator strain alone. Nodule occupancy was assessed by comparing the total viable count of nodule microbiota, which demonstrated the domination of bacteriocin producers. Bacteriocinogenic Rhizobium N8 strain can be explored as potent bio-fertilizers along with indicator Rhizobium spp. in mungbean. Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
