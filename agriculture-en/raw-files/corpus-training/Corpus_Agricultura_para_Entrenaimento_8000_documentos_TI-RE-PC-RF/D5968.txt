#ITI#Variation in susceptibility to wind along the trunk of an isolated Larix kaempferi (Pinaceae) tree#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the study: The force of the wind is a significant hazard to the survival of trees and can affect tree morphology. However, the actual distribution of the stress that wind causes to a tree trunk is not well understood in spite of its expected importance to tree morphology. The uniform stress hypothesis (i.e., tree trunks take a form that equalizes the distribution of stress along the outer surface of the stem) has been tested indirectly as a model, placing high importance on the mechanical safety of a trunk, and rejected theoretically. But stress on a tree's trunk has not yet been measured directly. Methods: Actual strains at the surface of the trunk of an isolated Larix kaempferi tree due to wind loads were measured at seven heights on the trunk for 1 yr. Key results: During the measurement period, wind-induced stress was higher in the upper portions of the trunk than in the lower portions, regardless of wind speed, and the difference increased as wind speed increased. The deflection of the trunk recorded at each position was also larger in the upper portions than in the lower portions. Conclusions: The results indicate that the upper portions of the trunk of an isolated Larix kaempferi tree are more susceptible to wind than are the lower portions. These results do not support the uniform stress hypothesis and suggest that another limitation (either mechanical or nonmechanical) acts on the morphology of the tree. © 2014 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
