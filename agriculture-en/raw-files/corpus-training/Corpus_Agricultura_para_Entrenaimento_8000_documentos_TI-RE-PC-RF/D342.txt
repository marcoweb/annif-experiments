#ITI#Phosphorous fertilization alleviates shading stress by regulating leaf photosynthesis and the antioxidant system in mung bean (Vigna radiata L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Shading can limit photosynthesis and plant growth. Understanding how phosphorus (P) application mitigates the effects of shading stress on morphology and physiology of mung beans (Vigna radiata L.) is of great significance for the establishment of efficient planting structures and optimizing P-use management. The effects of various light environments (non-shading stress, S0; low light stress, S1; severe shading stress, S2) on the growth of two mung bean cultivars (Xilv1 and Yulv1) and the role of P application (0 kg ha−1, P0; 90 kg ha−1, P1; 150 kg ha−1, P2) in such responses were investigated in a field experiment. Our results demonstrated that shading decreased the dry matter accumulation of mung bean markedly by limiting photosynthesis capacity and disrupting agronomic traits. For the leaf areas of the two cultivars, chlorophyll a+b, the net photosynthetic and electron transport rates were increased by 16.8%, 20.0%, 15.5%, and 12.5% under P1 treatment, and by 32.4%, 40.3%, 16.3% and 12.8% under P2 treatment, respectively, when compared to those for the non-fertilized plants under shading stress. These responses resulted in increased light capture and weak light utilization. Moreover, the activities of superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were enhanced by 20.9% and 43.7%, respectively; malondialdehyde and superoxide anion contents were reduced by 18.6% and 14.1%, respectively, under P application. These findings suggest that P application moderately mitigates the damage caused by shading stress and enhances tolerance by regulating mung bean growth. In addition, Xilv1 was more sensitive to P under shading stress than Yulv1. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
