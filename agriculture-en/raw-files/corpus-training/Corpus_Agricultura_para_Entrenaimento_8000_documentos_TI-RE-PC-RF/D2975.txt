#ITI#Inter-characters association studies for morphological, yield and yield attributes in the germplasm of french bean (Phaseolus vulgaris l.) in Tarai region of Uttarakhand, India#FTI#
#IRE#The 74 french bean genotypes were evaluated for twenty two quantitative traits to study the character association and path analysis during Jan- May, 2014. Pod yield was highly significant and positive correlated with days to 50% flowering, seed yield per plant, plant height, number of pods per plant, number of pod clusters per plant, number of pods per cluster, number of seeds per pod, pod length and weight of single pod. Path coefficient analysis revealed that single pod weight and number of pods per plant had the highest positive contribution towards the pod yield.
