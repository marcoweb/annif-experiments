#ITI#Critical points for closing the carbon and nitrogen budgets in a winter rapeseed field#FTI#
#IRE#The main C and N fluxes of a winter rapeseed field in Central Estonia were quantified for one year to identify the highest fluxes and major sources of uncertainty. Greenhouse gas emissions were measured with the closed chamber method, leaching losses were estimated by combining the soil water balance and leachate analyses, and soil C and N changes were also monitored. Gross primary production (GPP) and di-nitrogen (N2) fluxes were estimated from the C and N mass balance, respectively. The field was a net C sink (3366 kg C ha−1 yr−1) because of the high C absorption rate through GPP (17,215 kg C ha−1 yr−1). The N outputs markedly exceeded the inputs, which translated into soil N losses. The highest measured N fluxes were those of N leaching (44 kg N ha−1 yr−1) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (26 kg N ha−1 yr−1). Approximately 60% of the total N2O emissions occurred during the first 50 days after slurry application, promoted by field and weather conditions. The unaccounted soil N loss was attributed to N2 emissions (estimated at 668 kg N ha−1 yr−1). After conversion to CO2-eq, the positive balance of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions remained the dominant flux (34,571 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1), but N2O emissions were also notable (11,218 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1). The methodology used in this study provided estimates for the main fluxes in the C and N cycles, but also allowed the identification of methodological limitations and challenges.
