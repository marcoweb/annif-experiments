#ITI#Phenotyping to dissect the biostimulant action of a protein hydrolysate in tomato plants under combined abiotic stress#FTI#
#IRE#Drought and heat stresses are the main constrains to agricultural crop production worldwide. Precise and efficient phenotyping is essential to understand the complexity of plant responses to abiotic stresses and to identify the best management strategies to increase plant tolerance. In the present study, two phenotyping platforms were used to investigate the effects of a protein hydrolysate-based biostimulant on the physiological response of two tomato genotypes (‘E42’ and ‘LA3120’) subjected to heat, drought, or combined stress. The free amino acids in the biostimulant, or other molecules, stimulated growth in treated plants subjected to combined stress, probably promoting endogenous phytohormonal biosynthesis. Moreover, biostimulant application increased the net photosynthetic rate and maximal efficiency of PSII photochemistry under drought, possibly related to the presence of glycine betaine and aspartic acid in the protein hydrolysate. Increased antioxidant content and a decreased accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, proline, and soluble sugars in treated plants under drought and combined stress further demonstrated that the biostimulant application mitigated the negative effects of abiotic stresses. Generally, the response to biostimulant in plants had a genotype-dependent effect, with ‘E42’ showing a stronger response to protein hydrolysate application than ‘LA3120’. Altogether, in this study a fine and multilevel phenotyping revealed increased plant performances under water-limited conditions and elevated temperatures induced by a protein hydrolysate, thus highlighting the great potential biostimulants have in improving plant resilience to abiotic stresses. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
