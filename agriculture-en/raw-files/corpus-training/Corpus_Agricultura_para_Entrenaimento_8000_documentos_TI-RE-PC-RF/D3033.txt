#ITI#Role of irrigation and mulch in chickpea (cicer arietinum l.) growth, productivity and moisture extraction pattern in alluvial zone of West bengal, India#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted at Research farm, BCKV, West Bengal during rabi 2010-11 and 2011-12 to evaluate the effect of irrigation and mulch on growth, nodulation, yield and water use efficiency of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.). Chickpea irrigated at IW/CPE of 0.6 showed 7.14% and 23.53% higher seed yield compared to IW/CPE of 0.4 (0.98 t/ha) and Rainfed (0.85 t/ha), respectively and was significantly superior. Maximum seed yield of about 1.01 t/ha under the treatment receiving black polythene mulch, which was about 3.59%, 7.45% and 9.78% higher over the treatments receiving straw @ 5 t/ha, water hyacinth @ 5 t/ha and no mulch, respectively. Straw mulch @ 5 t/ha performed best regarding nodule dry weight and number per plant. Water use efficiency was highest with rainfed treatment and treatment receiving black polythene. Irrigation applied at IW/CPE of 0.6 maintained its superiority with highest net return, B:C, production and economic efficiency. Among mulches, highest return, B:C and efficiencies were recorded with the application of black polythene. Â© 2019; Agricultural Research Communication Centre, All rights reserved.#FRE#
