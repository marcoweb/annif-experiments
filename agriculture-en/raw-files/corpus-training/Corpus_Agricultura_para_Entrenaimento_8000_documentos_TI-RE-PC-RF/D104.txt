#ITI#Plant growth regulators modulate photosynthetic efficiency, antioxidant system, root cell viability and nutrient acquisition to promote growth, yield and quality of Indian mustard#FTI#
#IRE#A simple randomized pot experiment was conducted to elucidate the effect of leaf-applied nine plant growth regulators (PGRs), namely indole acetic acid (IAA), indole butyric acid (IBA), benzyl amino purine (BAP), chlorocholine chloride (CCC), gibberellic acid (GA3), kinetin (Kn), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA) and triacontanol (Tria) on growth, physio-biochemical, histochemical, microscopical and yield and quality characters of Brassica juncea (L.) cv. Pusa Agrani. The foliage of plants was sprayed with a uniform concentration of 5 µM each of the nine PGRs at 50 and 70 days after sowing (DAS). Plants were sampled at 80 DAS to assess growth, photosynthesis, enzyme activities, nutrient contents, root cell viability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) localization. Yield and quality parameters were measured at 120 DAS. The data showed that PGRs had varied effects on the growth, physio-biochemical and yield parameters. Among PGRs, SA, GA3 and Tria proved efficacious and improved most of the parameters studied in that order over the water-sprayed control. However, Kn, IAA, BAP, IBA, MeJA and CCC proved less effective and gave comparatively lower values for most of the parameters studied than the above three PGRs. Moreover, SA, GA3 and Tria reduced maximally the ROS generation in plants and the reductions were further validated with the confocal microscopy and histochemical examinations. The foliar application of SA increased, for example, shoot dry mass by 31.86%, net photosynthetic rate by 29.91%, seed yield per plant by 45.85% and oil yield per plant by 51.3%. Foliar application of GA3 improved leaf relative water content by 18.16%, stomatal conductance by 26.13% and leaf potassium content by 17.65%, while Tria increased leaf nitrate reductase activity by 24.68% and leaf nitrogen content by 21.45% over the water-sprayed control. Out of the tested PGRs, SA followed by GA3 and Tria proved to be the best for optimum performance of Brassica juncea (L.) cv. Pusa Agrani. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
