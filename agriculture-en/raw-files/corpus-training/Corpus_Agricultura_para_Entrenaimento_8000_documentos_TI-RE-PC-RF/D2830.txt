#ITI#Response of Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) to Potassium Application under Deficient Soils#FTI#
#IRE#The field experiments were conducted at the Punjab Agricultural University Regional Research Station, Gurdaspur, Punjab during the year 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 to evaluate the effect of Potassium application on the yield, yield attributes, nutrient uptake and agronomic efficiency under potassium deficient soils. The results revealed that the application potassium significantly increased the branches per plant, pods per plant, grain yield, biomass yield, 1000 seed weight (g), grain K content and grain K uptake. The data on the correlation analysis indicated that the K uptake was more where grain yield and biomass yield were higher. The data on partial factor productivity revealed the application of 30 kg K2 O ha-1 as the best treatment to achieve highest productivity. However, data on Agronomic Efficiency indicated that the application of 30 kg K2 O ha-1 may be recommended to achieve highest lentil grain yield. Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
