#ITI#Dephytinization processes of some legume seeds and cereal grains with ultrasound and microwave applications#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of ultrasound and microwave applications on color, phytic acid, protein and mineral content of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), soybean (Glycine Max. L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.) seeds were investigated. The loss of carotenoid pigments with ultrasound application is lower than with microwave application. This study showed that ultrasound application at 25°C gave significantly(p< 0.01) lower values in redness, yellowness,chroma and hue angle values of legume seeds and cereal grains compared to other application. The phytic acid loss was found to be higher in microwave application compared to ultrasound applications in all seeds. There was significant reduction in amount of protein and calcium, magnesium, photassium, phosphorus, iron and zinc in all seeds during all the applications to various extents. Ultrasound application at 25°C showed significant retention of minerals compared to other applications in all the seeds studied.#FRE#
