#ITI#Frequency of heterotic hybrids in relation to parental genetic divergence and general combining ability in blackgram [Vigna mungo (L.) hepper]#FTI#
#IRE#An investigation was carried out to test the predictability of frequency of heterotic hybrids based on parental gca effects and genetic diversity in blackgram. The 40 F1 s effected using 10 lines and 4 testers were evaluated along with their parents for 10 productivity per set raits. The overall gca status (high and low) of each parent and overall sca and heterotic status (high and low) of each hybrid across 10 traits were determined. Based on overall gca status and genetic divergence of parents, the hybrids were grouped into different classes. The hybrids involving parents contrasting for overall gca status and/or those involving parents with intermediate genetic divergence were more frequently heterotic than those involving comparable gca status and with extreme genetic divergence. It is hence, desirable to involve parents with intermediate genetic divergence and contrasting gca effects to recover higher frequencies of heterotic hybrids for productivity per se traits in blackgram. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
