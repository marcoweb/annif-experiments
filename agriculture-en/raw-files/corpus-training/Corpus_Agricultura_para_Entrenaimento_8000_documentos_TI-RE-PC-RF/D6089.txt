#ITI#Do seedlings of larger geophytic species outperform smaller ones when challenged by drought?#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: In semiarid regions, decreasing rainfall presents a challenge to perennial seedlings that must reach sufficient size to survive the first year’s seasonal drought. Attaining a large storage organ size has been hypothesized to enhance drought resilience in geophytes, but building larger storage organs requires faster growth, but paradoxically, some traits that confer faster growth are highly sensitive to drought. We examined whether tuber size confers greater drought resilience in seedlings of four closely related geophytic species of Pelargonium. Methods: We imposed two drought treatments when seedlings were 2 months old: chronic low water and acute water restriction for 10 days. Plants in the acute dry-down treatment were then rewatered at control levels. We compared morphological and ecophysiological traits at 2, 3, and 6 months of age and used mixed-effects models to identify traits determining tuber biomass at dormancy. Results: Despite a 10-fold variation in size, species had similar physiological trait values under well-watered conditions. Chronic and acute droughts negatively affected tuber size at the end of the season, but only in the two species with large tubers. Chronic drought did not affect physiological traits of any species, but in response to acute drought, larger species showed reduced photosynthetic performance. Canopy area was the best predictor of final tuber biomass. Conclusions: Contradictory to the hypothesis that large tubers provide greater drought resiliency, small Pelargonium seedlings actually had higher drought tolerance, although at the expense of more vigorous growth compared to species with larger tubers under well-watered conditions. © 2021 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
