#ITI#The impact of plant shaping on aphid behavior#FTI#
#IRE#The paper provides a review of the studies focusing on the impact of plant trimming and pruning (especially in tree rows) and tree crown formation (in orchards and urban greenery) on the bionomy and number of aphids and some other hemipterans. The fresh, succulent shoots which appear after any trimming and pruning provide aphids with "eternal spring" conditions, i.e. the availability of young leaves and shoots preferred by aphids as a source of nutrition. The majority of aphid species acquiring nutrition from leaves feed on the top shoots. People shape garden greenery, forming beautiful, decorative tree crowns. Some shoots in orchards are regularly cut off; sometimes even apple trees are planted in rows. Instead of building traditional fences, hedges are planted and regularly trimmed. Trimmed plants have fresh, succulent shoots, which are an attractive source of nutrition for many aphids. Large numbers of aphids inhabit these rejuvenated plants. Cutting and trimming of plants often have an impact not only on the number of aphids, but also on their bionomy.#FRE#
