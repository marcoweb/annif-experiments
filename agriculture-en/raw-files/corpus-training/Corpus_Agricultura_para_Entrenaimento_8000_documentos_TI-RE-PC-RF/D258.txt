#ITI#Overexpression of StCDPK23 promotes wound healing of potato tubers by regulating StRbohs#FTI#
#IRE#Calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) is a Ca2+ sensor that can phosphorylate and regulate respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh), inducing the production of O2−. However, little is known about how StCDPK23 affects ROS production in the deposition of suberin at potato tuber wounds by regulating StRbohs. In this study, we found that StCDPK23 was induced significantly by the wound in potato tubers, which contains a typical CDPK structure, and was highly homologous to AtCDPK13 in Arabidopsis. Subcellular localization of results showed that StCDPK23 was located in the nucleus and plasma membrane of N. benthamiana epidermis cells. StCDPK23-overexpressing plants and tubers were obtained via Agrobacterium transformation. The expression of StCDPK23 was significantly upregulated in the overexpressing tubers during healing and increased 2.3-fold at 5 d. The expression levels of StRbohs (A-E) were also upregulated in the overexpressing tubers. Among them, StrbohA showed significant expression in the early stage of healing, which was 16.3-fold higher than that of the wild-type tubers at 8 h of healing. Moreover, the overexpressing tubers produced more O2− and H2O2, which are 1.1-fold and 3.5-fold higher than that of the wild-type at 8 h, respectively. More SPP deposition was observed at the wounds of the overexpressing tubers. The thickness of SPP cell layers was 53.2% higher than that of the wild-type after 3 d of the wound. It is suggested that StCDPK23 may participate in the wound healing of potato tubers by regulating Strbohs, which mainly contributes to H2O2 production during healing. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
