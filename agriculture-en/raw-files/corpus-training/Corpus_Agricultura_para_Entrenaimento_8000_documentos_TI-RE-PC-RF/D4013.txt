#ITI#Investigating turkey enteric coronavirus circulating in the Southeastern United States and Arkansas during 2012 and 2013#FTI#
#IRE#Periodic monitoring of poultry flocks in the United States via molecular diagnostic methods has revealed a number of potential enteric viral pathogens in continuous circulation in turkeys and chickens. Recently turkey integrators in the Southeastern United States and Arkansas experienced an outbreak of moderate to severe enteritis associated with turkey enteric coronavirus (TCoV), and numerous enteric samples collected from turkey flocks in these areas tested positive for TCoV via real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RRT-PCR). This report details the subsequent sequence and phylogenetic analysis of the TCoV spike glycoprotein and the comparison of outbreak-associated isolates to sequences in the public database. TCoVs investigated during the present outbreak grouped geographically based upon state of origin, and the RRT-PCR assay was a good indicator of subsequent seroconversion by TCoV-positive turkey flocks.
