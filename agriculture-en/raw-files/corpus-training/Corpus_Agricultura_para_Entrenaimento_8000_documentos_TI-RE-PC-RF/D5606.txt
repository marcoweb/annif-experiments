#ITI#Avulsion of the common retinaculum in meat turkeys#FTI#
#IRE#An increase in leg condemnations was experienced in several commercial meat flocks of male and female turkeys. Affected legs had hematomas around and above the tibiotarsus-tarsometatarsus (hock) joint. Avulsion of the common retinaculum from the external condyle was observed when the skin and muscular fascia were removed. A farm investigation was performed and similar changes were observed in turkeys between 10 and 19 wk of age. Interestingly, birds with avulsion of this fibrinous bridge were not lame. Body weights were normal, no infectious agent was detected, and mineral contents of bones and tendons were within normal limits. Avulsion of the retinaculum might not have been diagnosed in the past because the birds are not lame and the lesion is tightly covered by the skin and muscular fascia.#FRE#
