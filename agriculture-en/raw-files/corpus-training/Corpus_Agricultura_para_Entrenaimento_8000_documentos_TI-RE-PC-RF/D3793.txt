#ITI#Studies on cereal soil-borne viruses in poland#FTI#
#IRE#Four soil-borne cereal viruses have been identified in Poland, so far: Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (SBCMV), Wheat spindle streak mosaic virus (WSSMV), Barley yellow mosaic virus (BaYMV) and Barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV). SBCMV was identified in 1993 as a dangerous pathogen of winter cereals and became the object of special interest. Studies on the virus included its biological and molecular characterization, and investigations of the response of winter wheat and winter triticale cultivars on the SBCMV infection. Results of preliminary experiments aiming at the evaluation of the response of winter barley cultivars on barley yellow mosaic viruses were also presented.#FRE#
