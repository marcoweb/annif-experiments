#ITI#Genetic variability determination in garden pea (Pisum sativum L sub sp. hortense Asch. and Graebn.) by using the multivariate analysis#FTI#
#IRE#A total of 32 genotypes collected from different geographical areas evaluated at one site to determine the genetic variability. Considerable diversity was found in different traits of horticultural importance. Principal component analysis showed more than 84 % of total multivariate variation for important traits in different genotypes. Pod yield, pod length,10 pods weight and pods per plant were found to be major traits contributing towards principal component-I. Similarly, seeds per pod, secondary branches/plant, pod length were main positive contributing traits towards second component. Ten pod weight, pod width were positively contributing component towards principal component third. Pods per plant and shelling percentage were main traits contributing to principal component-IV, where as plant height, pod length and pod width were major positively contributing traits towards principal component -V. PS-1100, Meethi Phali, PB-87 and FC-1 were most divergent genotypes. On the basis of cluster mean of single linkage cluster analysis, Custer-I was best for number of primary branches and shelling percentage, Cluster -II for plant height,10 pods weight and pod yield per plant, cluster-III for number of pods/plants and cluster IV for pod length. Selection of genotypes from divergent clusters and components having more than one positive traits for hybridization programme may lead to improvement in yield and quality of pea.
