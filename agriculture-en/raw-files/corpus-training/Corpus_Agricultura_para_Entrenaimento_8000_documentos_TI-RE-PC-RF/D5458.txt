#ITI#Pathogenicity of Turkey coronavirus in Turkeys and chickens#FTI#
#IRE#We designed this study to compare the replication potential of turkey coronavirus (TCV) and its effect in chickens and turkeys and to study the effect of single and combined infection of turkey poults with TCV and astrovirus. We studied the pathogenicity of TCV in experimentally inoculated turkey poults and chickens by observing the clinical signs and gross lesions. Two trials were conducted with 1-day-old and 4-wk-old specific-pathogen-free turkey poults and chickens. One-day-old turkey poults developed diarrhea at 48 hr postinoculation. Poults euthanatized at 3, 5, and 7 days postinoculation had flaccid, pale, and thin-walled intestines with watery contents. The 4-wk-old turkeys had no clinical signs or gross lesions. One-day-old and 4-wk-old chicks developed no clinical signs or gross lesions although the TCV was detected in gut contents of the birds throughout the experimental period (14 days). In another experiment, mean plasma D-xylose concentrations in 3-day-old turkey poults inoculated with TCV, turkey astrovirus, or a combination of both viruses were significantly lower than in the uninoculated controls.#FRE#
