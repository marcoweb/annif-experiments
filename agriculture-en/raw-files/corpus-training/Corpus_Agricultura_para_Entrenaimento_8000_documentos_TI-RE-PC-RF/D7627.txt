#ITI#Effectiveness of a subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters under low-pressure conditions#FTI#
#IRE#A subsurface irrigation system with ceramic emitters (SICE) without a pump has been developed to limit energy consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Yet whether SICE can be used in low-pressure conditions has not been tested; moreover, there is no index for evaluating the irrigation quality of SICE. Laboratory experiments, with six treatments, were conducted to study ceramic emitter hydraulic characteristics in the air and soil under different working pressure heads and emitter types. The results indicated that when H increased, the emitter discharge increased linearly, and the discharge deviation decreased in the air. With increased H in the soil, the emitter discharge, soil water content, and soil water content uniformity increased, and the discharge deviation decreased. When H was greater than or equal to 20 cm, the discharge deviation in the soil was less than that in the air, and the soil water content uniformity was higher than 80 %. The soil water content uniformity could be used in the evaluation of the irrigation quality of SICE based on the reliability and convenience of observation. To make the best use of soil water potential on the outflow of the emitter, reduce the discharge deviation, and improve soil water content uniformity, the working pressure head of SICE should be higher than 20 cm. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
