#ITI#Stability analysis of pigeon pea genotypes by deployment of AMMI model under rainfed environment#FTI#
#IRE#Twenty one genotypes of pigeon pea were evaluated in a randomized complete block design during the kharif season of 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2009-10 based upon number of primary branches per plant, pod length, number of grains per pod, 100-seed weight and seed yield per plant. The stability was studied by deploying AMMI (additive main effects and multiplicative interaction) model. The significant differences among the years were observed and measured more than 50% of the treatment sum of squares. First principal component axis (PCA1) of the interaction captured more than 60% of the interaction sum of squares for almost all the traits studied. The mean seed yield per plant was found highest (39.15 g) and at par similar in all the three years. Nine stable and high yielding genotypes viz., PUSA 2003-1; CORG-2001-5; WREG- 28; PANT-A-286; H-94-6; GT 101; ICPL-99004; ICPL-85010 and UPAS-120 exhibited stable performance under the rainfed environmental conditions for more than one traits studied and also under more than one year. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
