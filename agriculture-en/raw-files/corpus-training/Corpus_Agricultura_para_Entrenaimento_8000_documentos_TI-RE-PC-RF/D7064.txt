#ITI#A regional soil survey approach for upgrading from flood to sprinkler irrigation in a semi-arid environment#FTI#
#IRE#Increasing pressure on water resources in Spain is forcing farmers to move from flood to pressurized water application. Initial recommendations for this upgrading require soil survey information, especially in areas prone to soil salinity. In this article a 3158 ha soil survey at a scale of 1:25,000 is presented. Soil series are split in phases based on the texture of the surface layer, slope, and salinity. Available water holding capacity (AWHC), to a depth of 1.5 m or to a lithic or paralithic contact, texture and coarse components in the surface horizons, and salinity mapped as discrete soil units are combined to develop a regional soil suitability map for irrigation upgrade. To minimize soil erosion and salt mobilization in the soils, our recommendations are: (i) maintain and improve flood irrigation on 296 ha, (ii) develop standard sprinkler irrigation on 2261 ha, and (iii) move to high frequency sprinkler irrigation on 601 ha. This research demonstrates the importance of soil survey as part of the decision making process for upgrading the regional irrigation systems. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
