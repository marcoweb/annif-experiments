#ITI#Coronatine-treated seedlings increase the tolerance of cotton to low-temperature stress#FTI#
#IRE#Coronatine, an analog of Jasmonic acid (JA), has been shown to enhance crop tolerance to abiotic stresses, including chilling stress. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of Coronatine on cotton seedlings under low temperature using transcriptomic and metabolomics analysis. Twelve cDNA libraries from cotton seedlings were constructed, and pairwise comparisons revealed a total of 48,322 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis identified the involvement of these unigenes in various metabolic pathways, including Starch and sucrose metabolism, Sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis, Phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, alpha-Linolenic acid metabolism, ABC transporters, and Plant hormone signal transduction. Additionally, substantial accumulations of jasmonates (JAs), abscisic acid and major cell wall metabolites were observed. Transcriptome analysis revealed differential expression of regulatory genes, and qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression patterns of 9 selected genes. Co-expression analysis showed that the JA-responsive genes might form a network module with ABA biosynthesis genes or cell wall biosynthesis genes, suggesting the existence of a COR-JA-cellulose and COR-JA-ABA-cellulose regulatory pathway in cotton seedlings. Collectively, our findings uncover new insights into the molecular basis of coronatine--associated cold tolerance in cotton seedlings. © 2024#FRE#
