#ITI#Production of cell wall degrading enzymes and toxins by colletotrichum capsici and alternaria alternata causing fruit rot of chillies#FTI#
#IRE#The virulent isolates of Colletotrichum capsici and Alternaria alternata produced more cellulolytic enzymes viz., C1 and Cx in vitro than the avirulent ones and the activity of these enzymes increased with the increase in age of culture. The virulent isolates of C. capsici and A. alternata produced more pectinolytic enzymes (macerating enzymes, pectin methyl esterase and endo polygalacturonase) than the avirulent ones. All the pectinolytic enzymes were highly active in 10-day-old culture and the activities decreased with the increase of culture age. Whereas the activity of enzymes produced by avirulent isolate of pathogens did not decrease and these enzyme activities increased with the increase in the age of culture. These pathogens also produced nonspecific toxic metabolites in culture filtrate which reduced seed germination, root length, shoot length and vigour index of the seedlings of chilli, rice, mungbean, maize, cotton, groundnut, okra, egg plant, cucumber and tomato. The toxins of the pathogens reduced seed germination and caused mortality of chilli seedlings in pot culture. The toxins also produced phytotoxic symptoms in the treated ripe and green chilli fruits and leaves. © 2008, Versita. All rights reserved.#FRE#
