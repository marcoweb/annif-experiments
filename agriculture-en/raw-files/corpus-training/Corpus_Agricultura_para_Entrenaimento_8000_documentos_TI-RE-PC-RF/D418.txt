#ITI#Quantitative analysis of maize leaf collar appearance rates#FTI#
#IRE#Phyllochron, the reciprocal of the leaf appearance rate, is a critical genetic parameter in crop models for predicting growth characteristics and yield. Previous studies have shown that existing observations and predictive algorithms do not adequately represent a broad range of cultivars and environments. Here, we conducted a series of experiments in the field to quantify and disentangle the effects of sowing date and cultivar on maize leaf collar appearance (LCA). A bilinear model was found to accurately fit maize LCA (R2adj > 0.99); this model revealed a slower rate of LCA for the first leaves compared to the last leaves. Turning points in the model occurred between the 9.2th and the 13.1th leaf, nearly always below the ear leaf and around a leaf age index (LAI) of 60.0%. The phyllochron before the turning point (PHYLL Ⅰ) was significantly higher than the phyllochron after the turning point (PHYLL Ⅱ) for all three maize cultivars, and PHYLL Ⅰ was approximately two times higher than PHYLL Ⅱ on average. Both PHYLL Ⅰ and PHYLL Ⅱ were significantly affected by sowing date and cultivar. Variations in PHYLL Ⅰ and PHYLL Ⅱ indicated strong plasticity in maize phyllochron at different leaf ranks. The results of this study are critical for improvement of maize management practices and extend the applicability of phyllochron-collar measurements in crop models. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
