#ITI#Priming fresh and aged seed of soybean (Glycine max l.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: High and stable production requires quality seed. Seed quality is the basis of efficient crop production and farmers need such seeds for optimum yield production. Therefore, various procedures are applied in seed production technology that aim to improve not only the germination of seeds but also the speed of its germination. These methods can reduce of seed aging and the effects of different agroecological factors. Methods: For research the impact of priming used seed aged seven months (fresh seeds) and seed was nineteen months old (aged seed). The seed was treated with following solutions: Potassium nitrate (1%), ascorbic acid (100mgl-1) and potassium chloride (1%) for 6 hours and then germinated at 25°C in 8 days. Result: The analysis showed that seed aging resulted in a decrease in its germination energy and germination. Moreover, time required for germination is prolonged, the lipid peroxidation intensity and content of free proline are increased and the amount of vitamin C is reduced. The results showed that the effect of priming is dependable on variety selection, seed age and treatments. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no universal use of one only primer, as it may not be suitable for each particular cultivar and can ultimately lead to a decrease in the germination energy and germination. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
