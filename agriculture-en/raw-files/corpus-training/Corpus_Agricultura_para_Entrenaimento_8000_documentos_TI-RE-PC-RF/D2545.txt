#ITI#Comparative analysis of diversity based on morpho-metric and molecular markers in chickpea over different environments#FTI#
#IRE#Ten morpho-agronomic traits and 80 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) molecular markers were used to survey genetic diversity in 25 chickpea genotypes. Analysis of variance revealed significant variability among different genotypes for morpho-metric traits. The cluster analysis done using morpho-metric traits grouped 25 genotypes into seven and six clusters in Environment I (Env. I) and Environment II (Env. II), respectively. Three genotypes viz., ICCV-96904, HPG-17, ICCV-95503 and L-HR-1 belonging to diverse clusters were identified divergent and may use in heterosis breeding programme. Of 80 random RAPD markers, 25 were found polymorphic. Three major clusters were identified using 25 polymorphic RAPD markers. The genetic similarity coefficient among genotypes ranged from 0.57 to 0.91. The average polymorphic information content (PIC) for 25 RAPD markers ranges from 0.12 to 0.40. D2-statistic, RAPD analysis and study of genotypes performance revealed sufficient genetic diversity among chickpea genotypes which would be useful in future breeding programme.
