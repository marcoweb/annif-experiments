#IRE#The effect of some species of the Fabaceae family (the pea Pisum sativum L., broad bean Vicia faba L. and vetch V. sativa L.) on biochemical markers of oxidative stress within tissues of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris (Homoptera, Aphididae), has been studied. The highest concentration of superoxide anion radical (O 2-), hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2) and lipid peroxidation products thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was recorded for morphs that fed on the broad bean. The opposite tendency was observed for the level of total thiols, that were the highest for insects reared on the pea. Among the studied aphid morphs, the highest concentration of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide was noted for the wingless females whereas TBARS content was the highest within the winged migrant tissues. Different results were obtained for the total thiols, where apterae as well as migrants reared on the tested plants, had comparable content of these compounds. Our experiments indicate that oxidative stress may play an important role in interactions between the pea aphid and their host plants.#FRE#
