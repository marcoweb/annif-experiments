#ITI#Evaluation of new generation pesticides to control pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) infesting chickpea#FTI#
#IRE#A field study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of five insecticides viz., Lambdacyhalothrin 5 EC, Novaluron 10 EC, Clothianidin 50 WDG, Indoxacarb 14.5 SC and Quinalphos 25 EC (standard check) against gram pod borer (Helicoverpa armigera H.) on chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) variety Pratap Channa-1. Lambdacyhalothrin 5 EC gave the highest reduction in the larval population of pod borer and was found statically at par with Indoxacarb 14.5 SC. The next effective treatments were Clothianidin 50 WDG and Quinalphos 25 EC, However, Novaluron 10 EC @ 750ml/ha proved to be the least effective treatment as it resulted in lowest per cent reduction in the larval population. Highest cost benefit ratio of 1:2.10 was obtained from Lambdacyhalothrin 5 EC followed by Indoxacarb 14.5 SC (1: 1.65). The next cost effective treatment in terms of CBR was Quinalphos 25 EC (1:1.64), whereas, Novaluron 10 EC (1:1.15) and Clothianidin 50 WDG @ 500g/ ha (1:0.66) could not show any conspicuous gain over cost.
