#ITI#Concurrent aspergillosis and ascites with high mortality in a farm of growing broiler chickens#FTI#
#IRE#Two flocks of broiler chickens aged 15 to 30 days presented respiratory signs such as dyspnea and up to 25% mortality. These were the only two flocks in the farm where a bed of sunflower shells was used instead of the rice-hull bedding used in other flocks. At necropsy, severe ascites, right heart hypertrophy, pulmonary congestion, and extensive multifocal granulomatous pneumonia were recorded. Histopathologic examination revealed chronic multifocal mycotic granulomatous pneumonia. Aspergillus fumigatus was identified by microbiologic study from pulmonary specimens. After disinfecting the floor and changing the bedding, no clinical signs were recorded in the farm. Severe chronic granulomatous pneumonia caused by A. fumigatus in the chickens of the present study may have caused hypoxia, leading to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and ascites.#FRE#
