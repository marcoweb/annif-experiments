#IRE#Genetic divergence among thirty genotypes was estimated using Mahalanobis's D 2 statistic and total of six clusters were formed. Cluster II contained the highest number of thirteen genotypes followed by cluster I with eight genotypes and clusters V and VI contained one genotype each. The pattern of distribution of genotypes from different geographical locations into six clusters was random, demonstrating that geographical isolation may not be the only factor causing genetic diversity. The highest intra-cluster distance was observed for cluster V (17.30) and the lowest was observed for cluster I (9.52). While the highest inter-cluster distance was observed between cluster I and V (39.22). Cluster V recorded the highest mean for seed yield per plant, number of pods per plant, number of branches per plant, number of seeds per pod and 100 seed weight. Therefore, it was concluded that more emphasis should be given on cluster V for selecting genotypes as parents for crossing with the genotypes of cluster I which may produce new recombinants with desired traits.#FRE#
