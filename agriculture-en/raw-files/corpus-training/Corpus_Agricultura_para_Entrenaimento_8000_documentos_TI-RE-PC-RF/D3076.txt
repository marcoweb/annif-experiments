#IRE#                             A field experiment was carried out during kharif 2015 with thirteen ratios of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P                             2                             O                             5                             ) fertilizers with constant potassium level (25 kg K                             2                             O ha                             -1                             ) on soybean cultivar DSb 21. The treatment receiving N/P fertilizer ratio of 0.70 (basal application of 18 kg N, 46 kg P                             2                             O                             5                             , 25 kg K                             2                             O ha                             -1                              + foliar application of nitrogen @ 7 kg N ha                             -1                              at initiation of flowering and foliar application of nitrogen @ 7 kg N ha                             -1                              at 15 days after first foliar spray) recorded significantly higher seed yield (3217 kg ha                             -1                             ), haulm yield (3788 kg ha                             -1                             ), number of filled pods plant                             -1                              (44.73), total number of pods plant                             -1                              (47.57) and 100 seed weight (15.40 g) This treatment also recorded significantly higher total dry matter production (34.15 g) that higher gross monetary returns, net monetary returns and B: C ratio (Rs. 1,12,595, Rs. 89,770 ha                             -1                              and 4.93, respectively).                          © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
