#ITI#Halophilic soil microbial strains improve the moisture stress tolerance in oilseed crop by sustaining Photosystem II functionality#FTI#
#IRE#The sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) is a vital oilseed crop exposed to drought globally. A vast proportion of research is devoted to the naturally occurring microbes and their interaction with plants to alleviate stress consequences. Halophilic bacterial strains, i.e., Bacillus cereus KUB-15 (accession number NR 074540.1), KUB-27 (accession number NR 074540.1), and Bacillus licheniformis strain AAB9 (accession number MW362506), were isolated. Later, isolated strains were used for sunflower through inoculation. Plants were allowed to grow, and thirty-days-old plants were exposed to fixed moisture stress (40–45%). The functionality of photosystem II, light-harvesting ability, and physiological tolerance of cultivars were examined. Bacterial strains B. licheniformis sustained substantial electron flow in between photosystem II (PS II) and photosystem I (PS 1) that not only favored the passable photosynthetic performance but also enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity under stress condition. Compared to other halophilic strains, Bacillus licheniformis did manage reasonable relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll content index (CCI) and biomass production under stress condition. In comparison to both sunflower cultivars, bacterial inoculation was greatly restored growth and photosynthetic performance in Agsun-5264 than S-278 under moisture stress environment. Hence, it is suggested that that bacterial strain and plants cultivar compatibility are essential aspect for sustainable agriculture production. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
