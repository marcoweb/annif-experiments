#ITI#Pathogenesis of Histomonosis in Experimentally Infected Specific-Pathogen-Free (SPF) Layer-Type Chickens and SPF Meat-Type Chickens#FTI#
#IRE#Several studies have shown differences in the course of histomonosis, the infection with the trichomonad parasite Histomonas meleagridis, in different chicken breeds. In the present study, 10 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) layer-type (LT) chickens and twelve SPF meat-type (MT) chickens were infected intracloacally with 200,000 H. meleagridis trophozoites. One and two weeks postinfection (p.i.), three birds of each group were euthanatized. The remaining birds were euthanatized 3 wk p.i. Infected birds showed severe gross lesions typical for histomonosis in ceca at the first and second week p.i., while livers showed necrotic foci at 2 and 3 wk p.i., but only very rarely at 1 wk p.i. Differences between groups in the severity of lesions were statistically insignificant. In histopathology, LT chickens showed a significantly more-severe necrosis and ablation of the cecal epithelium 1 wk p.i. Parasites without inflammation were also found in most investigated spleens and lungs but only in a few kidneys. Investigation of these organs for histomonal DNA by real-time PCR confirmed these results. In addition, the humoral immune response against histomonal actinin 1 and 3 was measured by an ELISA. The humoral immune response against actinin 1 started sooner and was significantly higher in LT chickens than in MT chickens. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the genetic background of the birds influences the reaction to infection with H. meleagridis. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
