#ITI#Diversity of genome segment B from infectious bursal disease viruses in the United States#FTI#
#IRE#Several phylogenetic lineages of the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) genome segment B have been identified. Although this genome segment has been shown to contribute to virulence, little is known about the genetic lineages that exist in the United States. The nucleotide genome segment B sequences of 67 IBDV strains collected from 2002 to 2011 in the United States were examined. Although they were from nine different states, a majority (47) of these viruses were from California. A 722-base pair region near the 5' end of genome segment B, starting at nucleotide 168 and ending at 889, was examined and compared to sequences available in GenBank. The nucleotide sequence alignment revealed that mutations were frequently observed and that they were uniformly spaced throughout the region. When the predicted amino acids were aligned, amino acids at positions 145, 146, and 147 were found to change frequently. Six different amino acid triplets were observed and the very virulent (vv) IBDV strains (based on presence of vvIBDV genome segment A sequence) all had the triplet T145, D146, and N147. None of the non-vvIBDV strains had this TDN triplet. Phylogenetic analysis of the 67 nucleotide sequences revealed four significant genome segment B lineages among the U.S. viruses. One of these included the genome segment B typically found in vvIBDV and three contained non-vvIBDV genome segment B sequences. When the available sequences in GenBank were added to the analysis, two additional lineages were observed that did not contain U.S. viruses; one included viruses from China and the other contained viruses from the Ivory Coast. Although the samples tested do not represent all poultry producing regions in the United States, serotype 1 viruses from states outside California all belonged to one genome segment B lineage. The other three lineages observed in the United States were populated with viruses exclusively found in California, except the serotype 2 lineage, where the type strain was a serotype 2 virus from Ohio. The data provide further evidence for the importance of genome segment B identification during routine molecular diagnosis of all IBDV strains.
