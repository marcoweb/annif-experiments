#ITI#Development of an endogenous virus-free line of chickens susceptible to all subgroups of avian leukosis virus#FTI#
#IRE#Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) from special specific pathogen-free chicken lines are used for detection of contamination of adult or embryonic tissues, meconium, or tissue culture fluids with avian leukosis viruses (ALV). The suitability and efficiency of such tests depend on the susceptibility of CEF to the various subgroups of exogenous as well as endogenous ALV. The ideal CEF for such tests should be not only susceptible to all retroviruses, but also free of endogenous viruses so that such tests are immune to any interference that may occur between the endogenous and the tested (exogenous) viruses. CEF and/or chickens free of endogenous viruses are also desirable for gene transfer studies using retroviral vectors, such as RNA interference (RNAi) experiments and transgenic work. The absence of ev genes in CEF or chickens can empower clean detection of successful RNAi construct delivery or gene transfer. CEF free of ev genes are also essential reagents routinely used in growing and detecting unknown retroviruses in varied viral assays. This report documents the development of a new line of chickens, 0.TVB*S1, that is free of endogenous viruses and susceptible to all subgroups of ALV identified in chickens.#FRE#
