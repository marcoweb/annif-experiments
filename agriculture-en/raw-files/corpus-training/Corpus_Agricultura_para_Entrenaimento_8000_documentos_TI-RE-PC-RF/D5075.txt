#IRE#The effect of a systemic disease on the dynamics of iron, zinc, and copper in chickens fed ad libitum was examined by infecting 10-day-old specific pathogen-free chickens with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). Liver, bursa of Fabricius, pancreas, spleen, and serum were sampled in 10 controls and 10 challenged chickens at 3-day intervals postinfection (PI) for 15 days. The samples were analyzed using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Serum levels were similar to that reported in the literature. Concentrations of iron and zinc did not change significantly in the pancreas, but there was an increase in copper in infected pancreatic tissue on days 9 and 15 PI. Iron concentration in the spleen showed a significant increase on days 6, 9, and 15 PI, whereas zinc was only significantly increased on day 15 PI. There was no significant change in copper concentrations in the spleens of infected chickens vs. controls. This finding is in line with previously reported data. The results showed that the liver was not a major tissue where iron and zinc were sequestered, as previous data have shown in mammals. Instead, the bursa of Fabricius had significantly increased levels of both iron and zinc in infected tissue vs. control tissue from 9 days PI on. Furthermore, the bursa had increased levels of copper in the latter portion of the study. These findings suggest that the bursa of Fabricius rather than the liver is the major organ for metallic ion sequestering during IBDV infection.#FRE#
