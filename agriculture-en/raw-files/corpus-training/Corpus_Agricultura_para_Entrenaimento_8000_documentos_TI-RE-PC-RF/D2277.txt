#ITI#Long-term fate of fertilizer sulfate- and elemental S in co-granulated fertilizers#FTI#
#IRE#In previous studies, we assessed sulfur (S) uptake by crops from elemental S (ES) and sulfate-S (SO4-S) in S-fortified monoammonium phosphate fertilizers over two years. The recovery by the crop ranged from 16 to 28% for ES and from 9 to 86% for SO4-S. Here, we used a model which takes into account organic S cycling, SO4-S leaching and ES oxidation to explain the observed recoveries. Higher recoveries of ES than SO4-S in two of the four sites could be explained by partial leaching of SO4-S and relatively fast oxidation of ES, due to a warm climate and high S-oxidizing soils. The same model was used for longer-term (5-year) predictions, and a sensitivity analysis was carried out. The size of the labile soil S pool and total S uptake strongly affected the recovery of both SO4-S and ES. Predicted recoveries after 5 years were over threefold higher for a small than for a large labile organic S pool and for a high-uptake than for a low-uptake scenario. Leaching mainly affected SO4-S, with predicted recoveries halved under a high-leaching scenario. Slow oxidation resulted in recoveries in the first year being fourfold lower for ES than for SO4-S or even lower in case of a long lag-time. However, it is predicted that total recoveries of ES will eventually reach those of SO4-S or exceed them if there is SO4-S leaching. Our model demonstrates that long-term trials are needed to evaluate the true effectiveness of a slow-release fertilizer source such as ES. © 2021, The Author(s).#FRE#
