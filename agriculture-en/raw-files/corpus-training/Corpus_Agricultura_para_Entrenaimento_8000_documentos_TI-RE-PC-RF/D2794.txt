#ITI#RAPD based evaluation of genetic diversity in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#The genetic diversity among fifteen genotypes of groundnut was studied by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Total 15 be primers were used to detect polymorphism but only 13 primers showed amplification. Out of 13 primers amplified, 11 primers showed variable degree of polymorphism ranged from 25 per cent (S-31) to 100 per cent (OPD-02), whereas two primers viz. OPA-02 and S-67 showed monomorphism. Thirteen RAPD primers amplified 54 fragments, out of which 28 were polymorphic (51.85%). The number of fragments amplified per primer ranged from 3 to 5 and their sizes ranged between ~ 150 bp to ~ 1800 bp. Cluster analysis classified fifteen genotypes of groundnut into six main groups. The pair wise similarity values ranged from 76 to 94 per cent and showed that genotypes UG-109 and UG-110 were the closest with highest similarity value (94%), while genotypes UG-100 and GG-7 were most distinct with minimum similarity value (69%). RAPD marker can be used effectively for characterization of groundnut.#FRE#
