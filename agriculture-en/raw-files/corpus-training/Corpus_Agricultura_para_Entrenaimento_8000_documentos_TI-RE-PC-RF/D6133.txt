#IRE#Premise of the study: Determining effects of elevated CO 2 and N on photosynthetic thermotolerance is critical for predicting plant responses to global warming. Methods: We grew Hordeum vulgare (barley, C 3) and Zea mays (corn, C 4) at current or elevated CO 2 (370, 700 ppm) and limiting or optimal soil N (0.5, 7.5 mmol/L). We assessed thermotolerance of net photosynthesis (Pn), photosystem II effi ciency in the light (Fv'/Fm'), photochemical quenching (qp), carboxylation effi ciency (CE), and content of rubisco activase and major heat-shock proteins (HSPs). Key results: For barley, elevated CO 2 had no effect on Pn, qp, and CE at both high and low N and only a positive effect on Fv /Fm at high N. However, for corn, Pn, Fv'/Fm\ qp, and CE were decreased substantially by elevated CO 2 under high and low N, with greater decreases at high N for all but qp. The negative effects of high CO 2 during heat stress on photosynthesis were correlated with rubisco activase and HSPs content, which decreased with heat stress, especially for low-N corn.Conclusion: These results indicate that stimulatory effects of elevated CO 2 at normal temperatures on photosynthesis and growth (only found for high-N barley) may be partly offset by neutral or negative effects during heat stress, especially for C 4 species. Thus, CO 2 and N effects on photosynthetic thermotolerance may contribute to changes in plant productivity, distribution, and diversity in future. © 2014 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
