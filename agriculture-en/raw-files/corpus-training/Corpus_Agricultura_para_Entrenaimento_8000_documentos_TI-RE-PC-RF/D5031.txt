#ITI#Evaluation of the efficacy of a live fowlpox-vectored infectious laryngotracheitis/avian encephalomyelitis vaccine against ILT viral challenge#FTI#
#IRE#Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is caused by an alphaherpesvirus, and latency can be produced by previous exposure to vaccine virus. The main sites of latency for the ILT virus have been shown to be the trigeminal ganglion and the trachea. Reactivation of latent virus is one factor related to the production of clinical signs. The development of a genetically engineered ILT vaccine has been suggested for many years as a tool to eliminate viral latency. Several approaches have been suggested. Included among them is the development of a thymidine kinase-deficient mutant or the insertion of ILT viral glycoproteins into a viral vector such as a poxvirus. A commercially available, live, fowlpox-vectored infectious laryngotracheitis + avian encephalomyelitis (FP-LT+AE) vaccine was used in field trials in leghorn pullet flocks and evaluated by tracheal challenge in a laboratory setting with the use of the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, IA) ILT challenge virus. Interference of the pigeon pox vaccine, which is often administered concurrently with fowlpox vaccine, was also evaluated when given in conjunction with the FP-LT+AE vaccine. Overall, the results indicate that the FP-LT+AE vaccine provides adequate protection against ILT viral challenge. Proper administration is essential. In one flock, inadequate protection was most likely a result of either poor vaccine administration or previous exposure to pox virus. In addition, the simultaneous administration of pigeon pox vaccine did not appear to interfere with protection against ILT viral challenge.#FRE#
