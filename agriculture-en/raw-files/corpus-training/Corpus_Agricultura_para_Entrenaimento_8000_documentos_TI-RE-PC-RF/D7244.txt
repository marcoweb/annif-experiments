#ITI#Assessment of chromium toxicity and potential health implications of agriculturally diversely irrigated food crops in the semi-arid regions of South Asia#FTI#
#IRE#Heavy metal deposition in crops irrigated with wastewater is a serious environmental issue in many developing countries. This research looked at the probable health impacts of chromium (Cr) in water, soil, and food crop samples. The concentration of Cr was measured in samples taken from three sites: Sargodha City, Sahiwal, and Shahpur. Chromium levels were found to vary from 0.011 to 0.067 mg/L in water, to 0.223–2.49 in soil, and from 0.17 to 1.74 mg/kg in crops, respectively. Cr levels in the water, soil, and crops met World Health Organization requirements. Crop samples showed a positive correlation with soil chromium concentrations. There was a wide range in the bioconcentration factor (BCF), pollution load index (PLI), enrichment factor (EF), daily metal intake (DIM), health risk index (HRI), and target hazard quotient (THQ), which were all between 0.16 and 1.79. The BCF and EF were greater than one, which proves a high level of Cr mobility and metal enrichment. The PLI, DIM, HRI, and THQ of metal values were less than one, indicating that toxic metals were present in lower quantities in food crops and had no carcinogenic effects on consumers. Consistent monitoring of water quality, crops, soil, and better agricultural practices that inhibit metals from entering agricultural food reduce the potential health risks to consumers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
