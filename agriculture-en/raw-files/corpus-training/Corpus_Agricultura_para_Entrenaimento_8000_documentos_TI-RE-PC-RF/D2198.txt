#ITI#Introduction of various cover crop species to improve soil biological P parameters and P uptake of the following crops#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were conducted to clarify whether the introduction of several cover crop species increases P uptake of the following wheat and soybean. Four summer cover crops (sorghum, buckwheat, groundnut and crotalaria) and four winter cover crops (oat, rye, vetch and lupin) were tested. Growth and P uptake of succeeding wheat were significantly increased by P fertilizer application and tended to be increased by sorghum, groundnut or crotalaria incorporation, whereas buckwheat did not show positive effects. Growth and P uptake of succeeding soybean were significantly increased by oat or vetch incorporation and tended to be increased by P fertilizer or other cover crop incorporation. These positive effects of cover crops were attributed to the large amount of P incorporation, increase in the P-solubilizing fungal population and/or biomass P in soil. Sorghum, oat, rye and vetch were thought to be suitable cover crops to accelerate P uptake of the following crops since a large amount of P would be incorporated. Sorghum, groundnut and lupin were thought to be suitable cover crops because they increased the indigenous P-solubilizing fungal population in soil. Soil biomass P correlated with P uptake of wheat. Incorporation of suitable cover crops as a P source and activation of indigenous soil microorganisms by the carbon supply were thought to have accelerated P uptake of the following wheat and soybean. It is therefore thought that introduction of suitable cover crops could be an effective means to reduce P fertilizer application for the following crops. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
