#ITI#Dynamics of magnesium, copper and zinc from soil to forages grown in semiarid area in Sargodha, Pakistan#FTI#
#IRE#This investigation was carried out to determine the concentrations of certain essential elements (Zn, Mg and Cu) in soil and forages from two different sites in the pasture in Sargodha, Pakistan during two consecutive seasons of the year. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concentrations of these essential elements (Zn, Mg and Cu) in soil and forages in relation to the needs of livestock grazing therein.The results showed that mean soil and forage values of these elements generally decreased from summer to winter seasons at both sites of the pastureland. Mean forage elements were found to be lower than the requirements of livestock consuming these forages in the studied pastureland. The Cu and Zn concentrations in soil were found to be closely related to required level for forage from the soil, but Mg was higher than the required level, indicating no need of soil amendment for enhancing the level of this element in soil for forage crops. Based on these findings, it was concluded the pasture soil should be amended with Cu and Zn containing fertilizers and the ruminants feeding on those forage species should also be continually supplemented with specifically tailored mineral mixture containing these elements to avoid diseases caused by deficiency of these mineral elements.#FRE#
