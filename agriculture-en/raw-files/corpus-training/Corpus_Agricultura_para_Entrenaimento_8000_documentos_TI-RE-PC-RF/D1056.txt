#ITI#Endofungal bacteria and ectomycorrhizal fungi synergistically promote the absorption of organic phosphorus in Pinus massoniana#FTI#
#IRE#Ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECMFs) that are involved in phosphorus mobilisation and turnover have limited ability to mineralise phytate alone. The endofungal bacteria in the ectomycorrhizal fruiting body may contribute to achieving this ecological function of ECMFs. We investigated the synergistic effect and mechanisms of endofungal bacteria and ECMF Suillus grevillea on phytate mineralisation. The results showed that soluble phosphorus content in the combined system of endofungal bacterium Cedecea lapagei and S. grevillea was 1.8 times higher than the sum of C. lapagei and S. grevillea alone treatment under the phytate mineralisation experiment. The S. grevillea could first chemotactically assist C. lapagei in adhering to the surface of S. grevillea. Then, the mineralisation of phytate was synergistically promoted by increasing the biomass of C. lapagei and the phosphatase and phytase activities of S. grevillea. The expression of genes related to chemotaxis, colonisation, and proliferation of C. lapagei and genes related to phosphatase and phytase activity of S. grevillea was also significantly upregulated. Furthermore, in the pot experiment, we verified that there might exist a ternary symbiotic system in the natural forest in which endofungal bacteria and ECMFs could synergistically promote phytate uptake in the plant Pinus massoniana via the ectomycorrhizal system.
