#ITI#Identification and expression analysis of the ZRT, IRT-like protein (ZIP) gene family in Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze#FTI#
#IRE#The ZRT, IRT-like protein (ZIP) family plays an essential role in the homeostasis of zinc and iron in plants. However, studies on this family are mainly limited to model species. Here, 12 CsZIPs were identified and investigated the function in Camellia sinensis, being named CsZIP1-12 and divided into four different groups based on phylogenetic relationships. These CsZIPs contained 2–9 TMDs and other conserved motifs for ZIP proteins. And CsZIPs were located in cell membrane, excepting for CsZIP4 and CsZIP6. The expression of CsZIPs were different in varieties and organs of tea plants. They were involved in the response process of abiotic stresses, such as NaCl, drought, cold and exogenous Me-JA. In addition, 31 types of promoter elements were identified in the CsZIPs, including core promoters, light responsiveness, stress responsive and other elements. The CsZIP1, CsZIP2, CsZIP4, CsZIP5, CsZIP6, CsZIP11 and CsZIP12 could be induced by zinc deficiency and 50 μM Zn treatment, but CsZIP7 and CsZIP8 were up regulated by 300 μM Zn. Heterogeneous complementation analysis showed that CsZIP1, CsZIP2, CsZIP7 and CsZIP8 could complement the Zn sensitivity of △zrc1cot1 yeast double mutant. There was a positive correlation between the expression of CsZIPs and secondary metabolites in tea plant. Together, our analysis of CsZIPs could provide comprehensive insights on the structure and function of this protein family in the regulation of zinc and ion homeostasis in the tea plant. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
