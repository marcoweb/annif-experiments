#ITI#Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) based Metabolomics of Promising Chickpea Genotypes against Callosobruchus chinensis (L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The pulse beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis L. is one of the main biotic threats to chickpea in both field and storage in the world. The evaluation of chickpea genotypes for pulse beetle resistance has increased motivation for the identification and application of host plant resistance as a critical component of pest management. Methods: In the present study, different chickpea genotypes were evaluated under laboratory conditions to identify the antixenosis, antibiosis and GC-MS based untargeted metabolomics of promising chickpea genotypes to the C. chinensis. Result: Genotype NBeG1004 (36.61 eggs/100 seeds) was less prone to egg laying, while ICCV14872 (180.45 eggs/100 seeds) was the most preferred. However, maximal developmental periods, minimum per cent adult emergence and growth index was observed in ICCV92944 Genotype HC1 showed substantial resistance with maximum phenolic, flavonoid and protease inhibitors content. The results revealed that presence of 9-Octadecenoic acid (Z) in HC1 conferred resistance to C. chinensis. These results show assurance for incorporation into an IPM program against C. chinensis. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
