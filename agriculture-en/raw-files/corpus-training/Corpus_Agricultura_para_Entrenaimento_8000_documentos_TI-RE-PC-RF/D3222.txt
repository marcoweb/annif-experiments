#ITI#Phenotyping techniques for the selection of disease resistance in pigeonpea against Phytophthora Cajani#FTI#
#IRE#Different range of temperature and relative humidity were screened against host × pathogen interaction and temperature of 30°C and relative humidity of more than 85% was induced the maximum infection in the host with shortest incubation period (18 h). Further different inoculation techniques, inoculum dose and host age were studied for induction of infection in host and development of phytophthora blight disease. Of all soil mixing method of inoculation, inoculum dose of 10% and plant age of 10-15 days were found most suitable for development of disease. In combination, temperature of 30°C, relative humidity of more than 90%, soil mixing method of inoculation with 10% inoculum load can aggravate the disease development in 10-15 days old pigeonpea. Additionally set of 43 improved genotypes screened against P. cajani at field condition. Among all, ICPL 99044, ICP 8863 and ICPL 99055 were showed the resistant reaction. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
