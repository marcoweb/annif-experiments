#ITI#Effects of an S6 strain of Mycoplasma gallisepticum challenge before beginning of lay on various egg characteristics in commercial layers#FTI#
#IRE#Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) is a reproductive/respiratory disease in poultry implicated in suboptimum egg production and decreased hatchability. Commercial layer hens raised in a controlled environment were inoculated with the S6 strain of MG at 10 wk of age. Egg production and selected egg and egg quality parameters were quantitated over the entire lay cycle for inoculated and control birds. The S6 inoculation had no effect on bird weight, egg production, associated egg quality parameters, or histopathologic lesion scores. This study shows that in the absence of environmental stressors a prelay S6 MG inoculation does not produce detrimental effects on layer hen performance.#FRE#
