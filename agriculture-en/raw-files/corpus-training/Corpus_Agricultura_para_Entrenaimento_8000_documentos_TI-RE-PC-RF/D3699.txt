#ITI#Inhibitory effects of powdered caraway and peppermint extracts on pea root rot under greenhouse conditions#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of caraway and peppermint extracts was evaluated at concentrations of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10%, respectively on the radial mycelial growth of Sclerotium rolfsii. High significant inhibitory effect on radial fungal growth was observed with different concentrations of each of plant extracts. Concentration of 6% and more of the two extracts in combination were able to cause complete growth inhibition of the tested fungus. In greenhouse, the efficacy of plant extracts in addition to the fungicide Rizolex-T as seed dressing on pea root rot incidence was evaluated in pot experiment using soil artificially infested with the disease agent. All treatments showed a significant reduction in disease incidence compared with the control treatment. Rizolex-T followed by combination of caraway and peppermint extracts as a mixture showed superior reduction effect on root rot disease incidence at pre-, and post-emergence growth stages than individual treatment with each of extracts. The usage of caraway and peppermint extracts for seed dressing before sowing might be applied as control measure for controlling root rot diseases.#FRE#
