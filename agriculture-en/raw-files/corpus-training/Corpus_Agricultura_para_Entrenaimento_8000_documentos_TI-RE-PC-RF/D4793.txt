#ITI#Effect of selected water temperatures used in Mycoplasma gallisepticum vaccine reconstitution on titer at selected time intervals#FTI#
#IRE#Numerous methods are currently used throughout the poultry industry for the administration of vaccines. Each utilizes water for vaccine reconstitution and/or administration, including two of the three commercially available live Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) vaccines. Selected water temperatures were used to reconstitute and/or dilute the three commercially available live MG vaccines. Water temperatures included 4 C, 22 C (room temperature), and 32 C, and titer (color change units) was recorded at four time intervals, at point of reconstitution (time 0), 15, 30, and 60 min postreconstitution of the vaccines (time periods 15, 30, and 60, respectively). Results for F strain MG (FMG) vaccine showed significant decreases in titer from time 0 to time 15 for the 22 C and 32 C water temperatures but no significant decrease for any time period for FMG reconstituted with 4 C water. For 6/85 strain MG no significant difference in titer was noted for any of four time periods within any of the three water temperatures. For ts-11 strain MG a significant decrease was observed in titer at each of the four postdilution time periods when diluted with 32 C water. There was no significant decrease in titer at any time period for ts-11 MG vaccine when diluted with either 4 C or 22 C water.#FRE#
