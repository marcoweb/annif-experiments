#ITI#Temporal and spatial variations in N2O emissions from a Chinese cabbage field as a function of type of fertilizer and application#FTI#
#IRE#We conducted a field experiment in an Andosol near Tsukuba (Japan) to study the effects of the type of nitrogen fertilizer on nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions and on nitrogen uptake by Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L.). We used four treatments: fertilizer containing no nitrogen (CONT), broadcast application of urea (BR-U), band application of urea (B-U), and band application of controlled-release urea (B-CU). The application rate was 250 kg N ha-1, a conventional rate in the region. We measured N 2O flux two or three times a week during the 82-day growth period, then divided the cumulative emissions into three stages: early (28 days), middle (27 days), and late (27 days). The temporal variation in N2O emissions differed among the treatments. Broadcast urea application produced 70% of N2O emissions during the early stage. N2O emissions increased with increasing cabbage growth in the CONT treatment, indicating that plant growth accompanied by increasing root biomass could stimulate N 2O emissions from unfertilized soil. There were no differences in the patterns of temporal variation in N2O flux between the two band applications (B-U and B-CU); N2O emissions in the early and middle stages were 46 and 42%, respectively, for B-U, vs. 41 and 40% for B-CU. However, the overall N2O emission was reduced by 40.5% in the B-CU treatment compared with the B-U treatment. N2O emissions from the soils within fertilized bands were dramatically higher than those between the fertilized bands, and this trend continued until harvesting. Â© Springer 2006.#FRE#
