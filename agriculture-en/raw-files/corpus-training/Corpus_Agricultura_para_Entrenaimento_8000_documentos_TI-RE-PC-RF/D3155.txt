#ITI#Site specific nutrient management through targeted yield equations formulated for green gram [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek]#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted to formulate the fertilizer prescription equations for achieving desired yield target of green gram [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] during 2013-14. Three fertility gradient stripes were created by applying no fertilizer, recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) and double of the RDF in rice in order to develop three fertility gradient stripes during kharif. Each strip was again sub-divided into 24 sub plots and green gram was cultivated with different treatment combinations. One plot was kept as absolute control while FYM was applied in two sub-plots and rest 21 plots were applied with different graded doses of fertilizers. Initial and post harvest soil nutrient status, nutrient uptake, nutrient requirement, soil efficiency, fertilizer efficiency and yield data were recorded. The highest yield (12.15 q ha-1) was achieved with application of 30:50:50 (N: P2 O5: K2 O). Fertilizer prescription equations were formulated by multiple regression equation for site specific nutrient management on the basis of initial soil fertility status and targeted yield approach. The equations and ready reckoner were developed for higher production with optimum use of fertilizers according to desired yield target of green gram with sustainable manner. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
