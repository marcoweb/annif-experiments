#ITI#Effects of drying and rewetting on carbon and nitrogen mineralization in soils and incorporated residues#FTI#
#IRE#An understanding of nitrogen mineralization from residues and soil organic matter is important to understand the quantity of N available from the soil for crop production. The objective of this study was to determine effects of repeated wetting and drying of soils on rates of N mineralization. The study compared mineralization rates in three kaolinitic, low organic matter soils, utilizing cotton leaves or compost as residues. One set of treatments was subjected to repeated drying and rewetting, whereas the other was kept at constant moisture content. Mineralized N was measured by leaching with 0.01 M CaCl 2 periodically, for 185 days. Rates of C mineralization were measured in the treatment containers by periodic measurement of CO 2 respiration rates. In constant moisture conditions, soils with cotton leaf residue mineralized between 25% and 40% of N applied as residue, whereas soils with compost mineralized between 3.8% and 9.3%. In fluctuating moisture conditions, soils with cotton leaf residue mineralized between -1.3% and 6.9%, whereas soils with compost mineralized from 1.6% to 3.3%. Moisture effect was not significant in soils without residue, with soils mineralizing between 16 and 47 mg N kg -1. Carbon mineralization rates were not significantly affected by moisture. Both residue and soil type affected rates of C mineralization.#FRE#
