#ITI#Outbreak of Fowl Cholera in Baikal Teals in Korea#FTI#
#IRE#Fowl cholera (FC) caused by Pasteurella multocida, was diagnosed in waterfowl, Baikal teals (Anas formosa), submitted to the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine in Korea. The total number of mortalities was 13,228 out of approximately 100,000 birds that wintered in Cheonsoo Bay, the most important habitat area of Baikal teals in the world. Clinical signs were detected in only a few birds because of sudden death. Grossly, the dead Baikal teals had lesions consistent with FC, including multifocal necrotic foci in the liver with enlargement, petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhages on the heart, and mucoid exudates in the duodenal mucosa. Microscopically, there were hepatocytic necrosis with bacterial colonization, hemorrhage and necrosis in the myocardium, and hemorrhagic enteritis. Pasteurella multocida was isolated from the liver and the heart of all birds examined, and the isolate (P-627) was the serotype 1 x 12 x 13 by the agar gel immunodiffusion test. In order to estimate the virulence of P-627, 5-wk-old commercial ducks were exposed intramuscularly or intratracheally to the bacterium. On the basis of mortality rate, the isolate, P-627, was found to be highly virulent. This is the first report of an outbreak of FC in Baikal teals in Korea.#FRE#
