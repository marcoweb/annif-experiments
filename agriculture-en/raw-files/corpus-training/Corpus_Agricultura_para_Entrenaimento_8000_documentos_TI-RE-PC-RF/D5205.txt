#ITI#Heteroduplex mobility assay for genotyping infectious bursal disease virus#FTI#
#IRE#A heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) was developed to genotype infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV). This method analyzed 390-base pair (bp) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, encompassing the hypervariable region of the VP2 gene. IBDV strains from the United States and other countries were analyzed. The HMA was able to differentiate standard, antigenic variants and very virulent strains of IBDV. Minor differences between different strains from the same subtype were also detected. Close relationships between field IBDV with vaccines prepared with Delaware E strain were determined by HMA. The results obtained by HMA were confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences. The HMA proved to be a useful technique to rapidly genotype different field strains of IBDV and should prove to be a useful tool in epidemiologic studies.#FRE#
