#ITI#Influence of different nitrogen application methods and sowing techniques on sunflower hybrid#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during spring 2009, to study the sowing techniques and nitrogen application methods in spring planted sunflower hybrid (Hysun-33). Results were significant and it was found that higher achene yield (3014.4 kg ha-1),achene quality and greater economic benefit could be obtained under Faisalabad conditions when sunflower (Hysun-33) was fertilized with nitrogen by fertigation method and sown on beds.#FRE#
