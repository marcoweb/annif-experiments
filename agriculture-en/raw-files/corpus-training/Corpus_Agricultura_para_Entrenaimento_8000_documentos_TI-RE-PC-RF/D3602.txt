#ITI#Effect of microwave radiation and cold storage on Tribolium castaneum Herbst (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) and Sitophilus oryzae L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)#FTI#
#IRE#The combined impact of microwave radiation and cold storage on Tribolium castaneum Herbst and Sitophilus oryzae L. adults either continuously or intermittently was evaluated. The insects were exposed to 2 450 MHz at power level of 100 W for exposure time 10 min, continuously and intermittently. In all experiments, the highest rate of mortality was achieved for exposure time 10 min intermittently and 72 h cold storage duration. Intermittent exposures were generally more effective in killing insects of both species compared with those of continuous irradiation. Combinations of microwave radiation and cold storage were found highly compatible and synergistic. The synergistic interaction indicates that microwave radiation can be used with cold storage for management of T. castaneum and S. oryzae adult developmental stage. This treatment could provide an effective and friendly environmental treatment technique in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program.#FRE#
