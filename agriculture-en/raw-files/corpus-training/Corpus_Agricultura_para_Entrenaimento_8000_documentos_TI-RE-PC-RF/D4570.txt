#ITI#Genetic diversity of mycoplasma gallisepticum field isolates using partial sequencing of the pvpA gene fragment in Russia#FTI#
#IRE#The genetic diversity of the pvpA gene of Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) samples originating from commercial chickens was investigated. In the present study, we evaluated the genetic variability of 26 field samples of MG detected in commercial chickens and turkeys from 18 regions of Russia and compared them to the reference strains of MG available in GenBank. Genetic variability was evaluated by partial nucleotide sequencing of the pvpA gene, which encodes a putative cytadhesin protein. Comparisons with MG strains and isolates from the United States, Australia, China, and Iran using sequence analysis of PCR products showed that Russian MG field samples clustered more closely to each other than to the international reference MG strains. The MG pvpA sequences were found to be highly variable with a discrimination index of 0.975 for Russian field samples. No apparent cluster was found using the criteria of year or location of detection. DNA sequence polymorphism and size variation in the pvpA gene were shown among the Russian MG field samples and could be used for MG typing. These findings might help better understand the relationship among MG isolates from Russia and other countries. Â© 2010 American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
