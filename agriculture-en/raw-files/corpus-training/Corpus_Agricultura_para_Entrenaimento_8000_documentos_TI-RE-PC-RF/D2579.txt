#ITI#A modified pod specific promoter for high level heterologous expression of genes in legumes#FTI#
#IRE#Promoters are cis-acting regulatory elements that are usually present upstream to the coding sequences and determine the gene expression. Deployment of tissue specific and inducible promoters are constantly increasing for development of successful and stable multiple transgenic plants. To this end, as a strategy for enhanced expression of cis or transgenes, promoter engineering of the native msg promoter from soya bean has been carried out for executing pod specific expression of genes. Cis regulatory elements such as 5’UTR and poly (A) tract have been incorporated for imparting mRNA stability and translational enhancement to generate the modified 1.285 Kb pod specific promoter. Further to attain transcriptional enhancement the modified promoter has been cloned to generate Bi-directional Duplex Promoters (BDDP). The engineered msg promoter gene constructs can be deployed for high level tissue specific gene expression of cis/trans genes along with chosen terminator in chickpea. soybean and other legumes as well. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
