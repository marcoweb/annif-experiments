#ITI#Protection of neonatal chicks against a lethal challenge of Escherichia coli using DNA containing cytosine-phosphodiester-guanine motifs#FTI#
#IRE#Oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing cytosine-phosphodiester-guanine (CpG) motifs have been shown to be effective immunoprotective agents in murine models for a variety of viral, intracellular bacterial, and protozoan infections. We recently have shown that CpG ODN protects against extracellular bacterial infections in mature chickens. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of CpG ODN on Escherichia coli septicemia in neonatal broiler chicks. Two-day-old chicks, or embryonated eggs that had been incubated for 18 or 19 days, received 50 μg CpG ODN. Three days after exposure to CpG ODN, a virulent isolate of E. coli was inoculated subcutaneously in the neck of each bird. Birds were examined for 7 days post-E. coli challenge and clinical, pathologic, and bacteriologic assessments were conducted. The control group of birds that received no CpG ODN had a survival rate of 0% to 20%. In contrast, groups that received CpG ODN, either by intramuscular or in ovo routes, had significantly higher survival rates (P < 0.0001). Bacterial counts in air sacs were significantly lower when birds or embryos were treated with CpG ODN as compared with controls. A dose as low as 10 μg of CpG ODN, administered intramuscularly, was able to protect birds significantly against E. coli challenge. Formulation of CpG ODN with 30% Emulsigen did not enhance the protection. This study demonstrates that CpG ODN has systemic protective effects in broiler chicks against E. coli infections. This is the first time that CpG ODN has been demonstrated to have an immunoprotective effect against a bacterial infection in chicks following in ovo delivery.#FRE#
