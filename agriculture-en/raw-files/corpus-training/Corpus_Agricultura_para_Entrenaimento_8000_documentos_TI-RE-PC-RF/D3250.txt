#ITI#Studies on genetic parameters, correlation and path coefficient analysis in er2 introgressed garden pea genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation was undertaken to estimate the genetic variability, correlation and path coefficient in seven er2 (powdery mildew resistant gene) introgressed lines along with four standard checks in garden pea for different horticultural traits. The analysis of variance showed large variability among all the genotypes studied. The magnitude of phenotypic coefficient of variation was higher than the genotypic coefficient of variation for all the traits. High heritability estimates coupled with high genetic gain were recorded for number of seeds per pod, number of primary branches per plant and pod yield per plant indicating that these traits are governed by additive genes and selection in early generation may be effective. Number of seeds per pod had significant and strong positive association with pod yield per plant both at genotypic and phenotypic levels and number of primary branches per plant at genotypic levels indicating that selection can be made on the basis of these characters for improving yield. Results of path analysis revealed that days to 50 per cent flowering, number of pods per plant and shelling percentage had maximum positive direct effect on pod yield per plant. Hence, these characters can be considered as the most important traits for selecting high yielding genotypes in pea improvement programme. Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
