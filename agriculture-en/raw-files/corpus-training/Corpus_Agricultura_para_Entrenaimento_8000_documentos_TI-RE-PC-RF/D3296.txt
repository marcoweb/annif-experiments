#ITI#Genetic diversity and association studies in greengram [vigna radiata (L.) wilczek]#FTI#
#IRE#The present study was conducted to evaluate 44 greengram genotypes using correlation, path analysis, principal component analysis and cluster analysis based on ten morphological traits. Basic descriptive statistics showed considerable variance for all the traits. Association analysis indicated that, number of pods per plant, number of pod clusters per plant, number of seeds per pod and number of branches per plant showed significant positive association with seed yield per plant. Path analysis specified that the highest positive direct effect on single plant yield was exerted by days to 50% flowering, number of pods per plant and number of seeds per pod. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed 79.12 per cent of the variability by the first five components. PC1 was associated mainly with seed yield per plant, number of pod clusters per plant, number of pods per plant and number of branches per plant. The Wards method of hierarchical cluster analysis grouped the accessions into six major clusters. The clustering of greengram genotypes based on different morphological traits would be useful to identify the promising genotypes for effective utilization in future breeding programmes.
