#ITI#Estimating potential yield and change in water budget for wheat and maize across Huang-Huai-Hai Plain in the future#FTI#
#IRE#Climate change impacts crop productivity as atmospheric conditions and water supply change, particularly in intensive cropping areas. This study used the validated AquaCrop Model, which was run with downscaled daily climate data produced by SDSM and CanESM2. The changes in the potential grain yield of winter wheat and summer maize and water budget during the cropping seasons were estimated for the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain (3H Plain) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The results show that the potential yield of winter wheat is increasing with similar spatial patterns in the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s, with much of the increase is distributed in Shandong and northeastern parts of Henan. During the winter wheat growth period, the water budget deficit will likely improve from −210 mm in the 2030s to −202 mm in 2080s under RCP4.5 and from −206 mm in the 2030s to −191 mm in 2080s under RCP8.5 across the 3H Plain. The water budget during the winter wheat period will continue to be in deficit in the north 3H Plain and improvements are estimated mostly in the lower southern areas of the Plain. The summer maize potential yield is estimated to increase from the baseline period, but yields will decrease by 0.81%, 1.19%, and 2.10% in the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, under RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5. During the summer maize growth period, the water budget is also estimated to improve from 109 mm in 2030s to 126 mm in 2080s under RCP4.5 and 107 mm in the 2030s to 163 mm in 2080s under RCP8.5. This increase is mainly estimated in the central and south of the 3H Plain. The estimated ETc of winter wheat shows no significant decrease, while the reduction of 6 mm and 13 mm for summer maize is observed under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. The study provides scientific evidence to devise adaptation and mitigation climate change strategies for agricultural productivity and water resource management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
