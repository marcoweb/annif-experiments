#ITI#Finger millet response to nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in Kenya and Uganda#FTI#
#IRE#Finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn) is an important food crop of semi-arid to sub-humid Africa where little is known of its response to applied nutrients. Yield responses to nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) together with a diagnostic treatment (S, Mg, Zn, B) were determined from field research conducted in western Kenya and eastern and central Uganda. Grain yield was not affected by applied nutrients in some sites in Kenya, likely due to other prevailing stresses. Grain yield increased with N application for all sites and years in Uganda by a mean of 127% from the no N treatment (0 N) yield of 1.00 Mg ha−1. Grain yield increases ranged from 0.76 to 1.40 Mg ha−1 with 30 kg N ha−1 applied, with little added increase with >60 kg N ha−1. The mean economically optimal rate for N in Uganda was 72 and 43 kg N ha−1 with expected net returns to N of 166 and 279ha−1 when the N cost to grain value was 3 and 9 kg kg−1, respectively. Yield was increased with P and K application at two of four production areas of Uganda. Yield was increased by >20% with application of Mg–S–Zn–B in addition to N–P–K for all sites in Uganda with foliar concentrations indicating possible S and B deficiency. There is great profit potential in Uganda, and less for Kenya for N, but not for P and K, application to finger millet. Response to S and B needs further exploration. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
