#ITI#INDIRECT EFFECTS OF HERBIVORY ON PLANT–POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS IN INVASIVE LYTHRUM SALICARIA#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the study: Herbivory can affect a plant’s fitness in a variety of ways, including modifying the biotic interactions of the plant. In particular, when herbivory influences floral display, we hypothesize that pollinator visitation will be altered accordingly. Here we studied the indirect effects of feeding by two beetles, Neogalerucella calmariensis and N. pusilla, released as a biological control, on plant–pollinator interactions and fitness in the invasive plant, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria). • Methods: Two herbivory treatments (ambient and simulated) were applied to plants in a naturally occurring population of purple loosestrife. During flowering, traits of plants in the treatment and control groups were recorded. Data on pollinator visitation behavior was then collected after intense larval herbivory had ended. • Key results: Plants exposed to herbivory treatments produced more flowers and inflorescences but flowered significantly later than those in the control group. Moreover, we found a significant, positive association of herbivory with the number of flowers probed by bumblebees and with the number of times a foraging pollinator moved among inflorescences on a single plant. No differences in female fitness (fruit or seed production) were detected. • Conclusions: We conclude that herbivore-mediated differences in floral display traits impacted pollinator visitation behavior. However, as we discuss, differences in pollinator visitation did not translate into detectable differences in female reproductive success. We postulate that herbivory could influence other unmeasured aspects of fitness, such as seed quality or the number of seeds sired. © 2015, SAGE Publications Inc. All rights reserved.#FRE#
