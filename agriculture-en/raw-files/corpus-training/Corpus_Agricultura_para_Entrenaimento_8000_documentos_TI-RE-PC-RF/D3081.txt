#ITI#Genetic divergence and stability (AMMI) study in chickpea (Cicer aeritinum L.) under north western Himalayas of Jammu and Kashmir, India#FTI#
#IRE#Genetic diversity of seventeen chickpea genotypes was studied through Mahalanobis D2, Tocher’s Method. The genotypes under study fall into five clusters. The cluster-IInd contained the highest number of genotypes (08) and Cluster IV and V contained the lowest (01). Cluster-II produced the highest mean value for days to maturity. The inter-cluster distances were much higher than the intra-cluster distances. Cluster-V exhibited the highest intra-cluster distance while the lowest distance was observed in cluster-IV and V. The highest inter-cluster distance was observed between cluster-III and V while the lowest was between cluster-I and IV. Considering all the characters, it is suggested that the genotypes 81-0-800, C-306, 96907, C-235 and SCS-3 could be used as parents for future breeding programmes to develop high yielding varieties of chickpea. As per AMMI model, two genotypes i.e. C-81 and 96911 were identified as having wider adaptability along with higher seed yield per plant. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
