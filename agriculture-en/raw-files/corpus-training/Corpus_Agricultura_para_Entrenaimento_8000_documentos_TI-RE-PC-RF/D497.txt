#ITI#Leaf wettability is the main driver for foliar P uptake in P-deficient maize#FTI#
#IRE#Foliar fertilisation is an alternative form of nutrient application, which is of particular interest for phosphorus (P), where the efficiency of soil fertilisation is low. However, the uptake of foliar-applied nutrients is insufficiently characterised. The aim of this study was to investigate the individual and combined significance of wettability, foliar fertiliser properties and surfactant on foliar P uptake in P-deficient maize (Zea mays L.). Sorption and desorption properties of two P salts used as foliar fertilisers (KH2PO4, K2HPO4) were determined with dynamic vapor sorption isotherms. Leaf surfaces and foliar spray depositions of two differently wettable maize cultivars were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and contact angle measurement. Phosphorus uptake was then linked to leaf and fertiliser solution properties and its effect on cell ultrastructure was characterised by transmission electron microscopy. Wettability was the key factor for P absorption, as all foliar fertilisers were taken up reaching a tissue-P level of adequately nourished plants. For unwettable leaves, only solutions with surfactant, especially the combination of surfactant and hygroscopic P salt (K2HPO4) were taken up. This study provides novel insights into the significance of leaf surface and fertiliser properties, which can thus contribute to an improvement of P fertilisation strategies. © 2023 The Authors#FRE#
