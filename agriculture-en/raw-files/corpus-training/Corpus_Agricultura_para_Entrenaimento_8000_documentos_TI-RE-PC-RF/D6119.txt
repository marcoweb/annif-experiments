#ITI#Linking safe sites for recruitment with host-canopy heterogeneity: The case of a parasitic plant, Viscum album subsp. austriacum (Viscaceae)#FTI#
#IRE#• Premise of the study: Canopies are ecologically relevant compartments of forests. Multiple sources of heterogeneity interact within forest canopies due to their structural complexity, which exert major influences on the structure and composition of epiphyte communities. Here, we explore canopy environmental heterogeneity of a Mediterranean pine forest, identifying the key biotic and abiotic factors determining mistletoe (Viscum album subsp. austriacum) recruitment at coarse and fine spatial scales. • Methods: Through field experiments, we assessed the range of suitable host species for V. album subsp. austriacum (hereafter, V. a. austriacum). We characterized the variation in abiotic factors at a fine spatial scale on the host species. Finally, we examined the effects of biotic (predation) and abiotic (light, temperature) factors on the fate of mistletoe seeds and seedlings along host branches. • Key results: We confirmed the tight specificity of V. a. austriacum to pine species, in particular to P. nigra at the local scale. Biotic constraints increased toward the branch interior, with minor effects on apical locations due to the positive effect of pine-needle coverage. Contrarily, abiotic constraints increased toward branch extremities, harming mistletoe seeds by encouraging their desiccation. • Conclusions: Biotic and abiotic variables exert a strong, nonrandom filter on V. album regeneration, resulting in recruitment hotspots at the periphery of the branches and sites with a high probability of recruitment failure at thicker and more exposed locations. The narrow range of suitable host species and the scarcity and spatially restricted recruitment hotspots for V. a. austriacum leads to the clumping of mistletoe populations at the finer spatial scale. © 2014 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
