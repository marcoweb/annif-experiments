#ITI#Improvement of mung bean growth and productivity by phosphate-dissolving fungi aspergillus niger seed inoculation#FTI#
#IRE#Efficiency of Aspergillus niger was studied in a pot experiment to evaluate improvement of mung bean [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] growth and productivity. A significant (p=0.05) increase in plant growth and yield parameters (plant height, number of nodules, number of branches, number of pods, seed yield and test weight) were noticed as compared to uninoculated treatments. In general there was a significant improvement in uptake of N, P, K, Fe and Zn as compared to absolute control. It was found that inoculation by A. niger increased uptake of nitrogen by 7%, phosphorus and zinc by 9%, potassium by 8% and iron by 17% as compared to uninoculated treatments. The experiment confirmed that A. niger had a significant effect on growth and nutrient uptake in the mung bean and indicated that this fungi play an important role in growth and nutrition of mung bean in sub-humid region.#FRE#
