#ITI#Effect of phosphorus on the performance of greengram (Vigna radiata L) varieties during summer#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiment was conducted at CCS Haryana Agricultural University KrishiVigyan Kendra, Ambala during summer season of 2014 to study the effect of phosphorus levels and varieties on growth, yield parameters, yield, economics and nutrient uptake of greengram. The experiment was laid out in randomized block design with two varieties of green gram viz. MH 421 and SML 668 and four phosphorus levels viz. control (no fertilizer), 20, 40 and 60 kg P2O5/ha with 4 replications. Cv.MH421 produced significantly higher seed yield (1158 kg/ha), yield attributing parameters, harvest index, attraction index, net returns (Rs. 21001/ha), BC ratio (1.60) and nutrient uptake compared to SML 668 during summer season. Application of 40 kg P2O5/ha registered significantly higher seed yield (1283 kg/ha), yield attributing characters, harvest index, attraction index, net returns (Rs. 32351/ha), BC ratio (2.08) and nutrient uptake of green gram compared to control and 20 kg P2O5/ha. However, 40 kg P2O5/ha and 60 kg P2O5/ha were at par with respect to majority of studied. Â© 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
