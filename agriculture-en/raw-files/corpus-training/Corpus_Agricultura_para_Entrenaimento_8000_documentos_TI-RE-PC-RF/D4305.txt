#ITI#Optimization of a duplex real-time PCR method for relative quantitation of infectious laryngotracheitis virus#FTI#
#IRE#Infectious laryngotracheitis is a highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens controlled by biosecurity and vaccination with live attenuated or recombinant vaccines. Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) infections are characterized by a peak of viral replication in the trachea followed by a steady decrease in replication that results in the establishment of latency. Estimation of viral load is an important tool to determine the stage of ILTV infection. Here, a multiplex real-time PCR was optimized for the quantification of ILTV genomes. Quantification of viral genomes was based on the amplification of the ILTV UL44 gene, and sample variability was normalized using the chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) 2-collagen gene as an endogenous control in a duplex reaction. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
