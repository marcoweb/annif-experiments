#ITI#Nitrogen- or phosphorus-based pig manure application rates affect soil test phosphorus and phosphorus loss risk#FTI#
#IRE#Pig manure is an effective source of plant nutrients that must be properly managed to prevent these nutrients from reaching surface and ground water. We conducted a 3-year study in southern Manitoba to investigate how the choice of cropping system and manure management practices affect soil test phosphorus (STP) concentration and loss of phosphorus (P) to groundwater. The experiment had a split-plot design with two cropping systems (annual and perennial) as main plots, and five nutrient management treatments as subplots: N-based liquid pig manure, P-based liquid pig manure, N-based solid pig manure, P-based solid pig manure and an unfertilized control. We did not measure an appreciable increase in STP concentration below the 0.15 m depth. However, manure application at an N-based rate resulted in increased STP concentration in the 0–0.15 m depth interval. After 3-year, STP concentration in the N-based treatments (48 and 43 mg Olsen P kg−1 for solid and liquid respectively) were significantly greater than for the P-based treatments (26 and 17 mg Olsen P kg−1 for solid and liquid respectively). The mass of P in the leachate was small, ranging from a low of 1 g P ha−1 in 2009 to a high of 100 g P ha−1 in 2011. Both P- and N-based manure application rates produced no apparent risk of P leaching at our site, but the N-based manure application rate increased STP concentration in the surface soil, which could lead to the loss of P in surface runoff. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.#FRE#
