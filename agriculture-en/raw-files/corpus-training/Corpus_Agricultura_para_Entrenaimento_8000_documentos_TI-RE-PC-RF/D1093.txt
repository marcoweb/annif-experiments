#ITI#Mutant noxy8 exposes functional specificities between the chloroplast chaperones CLPC1 and CLPC2 in the response to organelle stress and plant defence#FTI#
#IRE#Chloroplast function is essential for growth, development, and plant adaptation to stress. Organelle stress and plant defence responses were examined here using noxy8 (nonresponding to oxylipins 8) from a series of Arabidopsis mutants. The noxy8 mutation was located at the CLPC2 gene, encoding a chloroplast chaperone of the protease complex CLP. Although its CLPC1 paralogue is considered to generate redundancy, our data reveal significant differences distinguishing CLPC2 and CLPC1 functions. As such, clpc1 mutants displayed a major defect in housekeeping chloroplast proteostasis, leading to a pronounced reduction in growth and pigment levels, enhanced accumulation of chloroplast and cytosol chaperones, and resistance to fosmidomycin. Conversely, clpc2 mutants showed severe susceptibility to lincomycin inhibition of chloroplast translation and resistance to Antimycin A inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. In the response to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, clpc2 but not clpc1 mutants were resistant to bacterial infection, showing higher salicylic acid levels, defence gene expression and 9-LOX pathway activation. Our findings suggest CLPC2 and CLPC1 functional specificity, with a preferential involvement of CLPC1 in housekeeping processes and of CLPC2 in stress responses. © 2024 The Authors.
