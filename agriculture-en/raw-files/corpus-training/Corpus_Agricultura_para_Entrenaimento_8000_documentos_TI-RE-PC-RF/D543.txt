#ITI#Responses of Trollius chinensis to drought stress and rehydration: From photosynthetic physiology to gene expression#FTI#
#IRE#Drought stress occurs more frequently in recent years due to the global climate change. Widely distributed in northern China, Mongolia, and Russia, Trollius chinensis Bunge has high medicinal and ornamental values and is often exposed to drought stress, while the mechanism underlying its drought response is still unclear. In this study, we applied 74–76% (control, CK), 49–51% (mild drought), 34–36% (moderate drought), and 19–21% (severe drought, SD) of the soil gravimetric water content to T. chinensis, and measured leaf physiological characteristics on the 0, 5th, 10th, 15th day after the soil reaching the set drought severities, and on the 10th day after rehydration. The results showed that many physiological parameters, such as chlorophyll contents, Fv/Fm, ΦPSⅡ, Pn, and gs decreased with the deepening of severity and duration of drought stress and recovered to some extent after rehydration. On the 10th day of drought stress, leaves in SD and CK were selected for RNA-Seq, and 1649 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found, including 548 up-regulated and 1101 down-regulated DEGs. Gene Ontology enrichment found that the DEGs were mainly enriched in catalytic activity and thylakoid. Koyto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment found that DEGs were enriched in some metabolic pathways such as carbon fixation and photosynthesis. Among them, the differential expression of genes related to photosynthesis process, ABA biosynthesis and signaling pathway, such as NCED, SnRK2, PsaD, PsbQ, and PetE, might explain why T. chinensis could tolerate and recover from as long as 15 days of severe drought conditions. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
