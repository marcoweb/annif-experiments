#ITI#Spread and acceptance of recommended production technologies in green gram and black gram: A comparative analysis#FTI#
#IRE#A study was conducted in green gram and black gram in the selected blocks of Madurai district with the main objectives to study the extent of adoption of recommended pulse production technologies (Rice fallow and Pure crop) and also to study the constraints in the adoption of the recommended technologies. The pure crop respondents (Black gram) have fairly adopted the technologies viz., right time of sowing, optimum seed rate, recommended fertilizer, regular weeding, control of pod borer and powdery mildew and harvesting at the right time. In the practices viz., seed treatment, DAP spray at flowering, trimming and plastering of field bunds, control of sucking pests and storing the harvested produce in the polythene lined gunny bag they are not up to the expectation. At the same time, rice fallow respondents have poorly adopted almost all the recommended technologies. Almost similar trend prevailed in the green gram also The most felt were biological constraints and socio economic constraints, followed by technological and infrastructural constraints.#FRE#
