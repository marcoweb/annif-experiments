#ITI#Effect of IBV-H120 vaccination in broilers on colibacillosis susceptibility after infection with a virulent Massachusetts-type IBV strain#FTI#
#IRE#Vaccination against infectious bronchitis (IB) is aimed to protect against clinical IB. The question is, however, whether vaccinated birds are also protected against predisposure for colibacillosis after a subsequent IBV infection. We examined this research question in four experiments. One-day-old commercial broilers, housed in isolators, were vaccinated with IB vaccine strain H120 by coarse spray or ocularly. Twenty-eight days after vaccination, broilers were challenged with the virulent IBV strain M41. Five days later, broilers were inoculated with Escherichia coli strain 506. Body weight uniformity, severity of E. coli airsacculitis, and systemic E. coli infection at 7 days following E. coli inoculation were used as parameters for colibacillosis. IBV vaccination reduced both the number of broilers with E. coli airsacculitis as well as the severity of airsacculitis significantly after challenge with IBV-M41 and E. coli 506. However, in spray-vaccinated groups, no significant reduction of the number of birds with systemic colibacillosis or the severity of this infection was obtained, and body weight uniformity was not significantly improved compared with nonvaccinated, IBV-M41, and E. coli 506-challenged groups. Eye-drop vaccination resulted in conflicting results.#FRE#
