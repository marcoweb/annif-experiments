#ITI#Performance of cowpea [vigna unguiculata (L.) walp] under organic production system in southern dry zone of karnataka#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was carried out during kharif 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 at Zonal Agricultural Research Station, V. C. Farm, Mandya to study the performance of cowpea under organic production system in red sandy loam soil. The results revealed that application of 100% N equivalent compost + recommended FYM (10 t/ha) + beejamrutha (seed treatment) + jeevamrutha (500 liter/ ha) recorded significantly higher grain yield during all the years of experimentation (2056, 1987, 2108 and 2365 kg/ha, respectively) and also in their pooled data (grain yield 2129 kg/ha). This increased yield was attributed to more availability of nitrogen (289.5 kg/ ha), phosphorus (40.5 kg/ha) and potassium (182.3 kg/ha) in the soil compared to other treatments. The benefit: cost ratio was higher with application of 100% N equivalent compost + jeevamrutha + beejamrutha (2.81). Soil chemical properties, viz. soil pH, organic carbon content and electric conductivity, were not influenced significantly by application of organic manures. However, there was an improvement in the soil chemical properties (289.5, 40.5 and 182.3 N, P2O5 and K2O kg/ha, respectively) compared to initial soil data (229, 19.2 and 135 NPK kg/ha).
