#ITI#Lack of antigenic relationships between avian pneumovirus and four avian paramyxoviruses#FTI#
#IRE#Avian paramyxoviruses (PMVs) and avian pneumovirus (APV) belong to the family Paramyxoviridae. Antigenic relationships between PMVs were shown previously, hence, this study was designed to investigate possible antigenic relationships between APV and four avian PMVs (PMV-1, PMV-2, PMV-3, and PMV-7). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, and virus neutralization (VN) test in chicken embryos and in Vero cells were used. The HI test was performed with the PMVs as antigens against the APV and PMVs antisera. The ELISA and VN test in chicken embryos were performed with PMVs and APV antigens and antisera. The VN test in vero cells was performed with the APV as an antigen against the PMV antisera. All the viruses were isolated in the United States or Canada. No antigenic relationships between APV and the PMVs were detected by the described tests.#FRE#
