#ITI#In Vitro Inactivation of Two Egyptian A/H5N1 Viruses by Four Commercial Chemical Disinfectants#FTI#
#IRE#The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus (A/H5N1) devastated the poultry industry and posed a serious health threat. Cleaning and disinfection are essential parts of preventative and postoutbreak management of A/H5N1 infections in poultry. In this preliminary study, we used suspension and carrier tests to evaluate the impact of concentration, time of exposure, surface porosity, and organic matter on the ability of four commercial chemical disinfectants to inactivate two A/H5N1 viruses of clade 2.2.1 isolated in 2006 and 2010 from broiler flocks in Egypt. Viruses were incubated with 0.5%, 1%, and 2% of formalin, glutaraldehyde, TH4®, and Virkon® S for 15, 30, 60, and 120 min at room temperature (22 ± 2 C). In suspension tests, in the absence of organic matter, all disinfectants, at each concentration, except Virkon S 0.5%, effectively inactivated virus suspensions after a 15-min exposure time. In the presence of organic matter, the use of low concentrations of formalin (0.5%), glutaraldehyde (0.5%), or Virkon S (0.5%) was not sufficient to inactivate the viruses after 15 min. In gauze carrier tests, only formalin at any concentration for 15 min was sufficient to inactivate the viruses, whereas different concentrations or exposure times were required for glutaraldehyde (0.5% for 60 min), TH4 (0.5% for 30 min), and Virkon S (0.5% for 60 min or 1% for 30 min). In wood carrier tests, total inactivation of the virus was obtained at concentrations of 0.5% for 30 min (formalin and TH4) or 60 min (glutaraldehyde and Virkon S). This study emphasizes the need to use high concentrations of and/or extended time of exposure to disinfectants for efficient inactivation of A/H5N1, particularly in the presence of organic matter or different surfaces, which are common in poultry operations. In addition, it seemed that the virus isolated in 2010 was more resistant to disinfectants than the isolate from 2006 when wood was used as a carrier. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
