#ITI#Resistance level of mung bean genotypes to pod borer maruca testulalis geyer#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Pod borer, Maruca testulalis is one of the harmful mung bean pests and cause substantial damage to the crop or failure to harvest. This study was carried out to identify the level of resistance to pod borer of mungbean accessions. Methods: Field research was conducted at Muneng Experimental Farm, Probolinggo, East Java, Indonesia in the 2018 dry season using the randomized block design and repeated two times. A total of 50 accessions of mungbeans were planted in two growing environments, namely: L1 = controlled environment (Maruca pest was controlled with NPV biopesticide 2 g/liter of water) and L2 = uncontrolled environment (Maruca pest was not controlled with any kind of pesticide). Observations were made on the intensity of borer attack and dry seed weight. Result: Eleven accessions gave a low resistant (LR) to moderately resistant (MR) categories responses against M. testulalis attacks. The pod damage from the eleven selected accessions was less than 15% under environmental conditions without control (L2). Control application (L1) reduced pod damage by 48.5% and increased mung bean seed yield by 25%, compared to without control (L2). The eleven accessions that were consistent or stable with low attack intensity under conditions with and without control gave dry seed weights above average, except for accessions (MLGV 0054, MLGV 0115 and MLGV 0320) which had dry seed weights lower than the average both in the growing environment with control (L1) or without control (L2). © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
