#ITI#An influence of herbs on the sex structure in populations of insect pests of stored products#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of powdered herbs (lavender Lavandula officinalis L., peppermint Mentha piperita L. and basil Ocimium basilicum L.) added to the food substances of three insect species: the rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae (L.), lesser grain borer Rhyzopertha dominica (F.), and the saw-toothed grain beetle Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.) on the life span and development of the three insect species as well as habitat conditions, sex structure, and the survivability of males and females were considered. The experiments were conducted in the laboratory at a temperature of 28°C and relative humidity (RH) 60 ±5%. In all the studied populations, high female mortality was found (♂/♀< 1). The studied populations were: the rice weevil and the lesser grain borer cultured in wheat grain with herb additions, and the saw-toothed grain beetle cultured in semolina with herb additions. Among the herbs used, peppermint caused a significant effect in the form of increased mortality rates among females of S. oryzae and O. surinamensis. Lavender and basil had a similar impact among R. dominica females. The herbs applied in the experiments intensified the mortality of females and, consequently, led to the disappearance of entire populations.#FRE#
