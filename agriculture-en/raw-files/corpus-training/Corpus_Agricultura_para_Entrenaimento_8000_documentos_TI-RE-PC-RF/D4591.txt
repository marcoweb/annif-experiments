#ITI#Field evidence of the efficacy of vaccination to control low pathogenicity avian influenza in meat Turkeys#FTI#
#IRE#This paper analyzes the efficacy of vaccination to control low pathogenicity avian influenza outbreaks using information collected during four epidemics occurring in Italy between 2000 and 2005. Different vaccination strategies and protocols for meat-turkey immunization are also considered. Â© 2010 American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
