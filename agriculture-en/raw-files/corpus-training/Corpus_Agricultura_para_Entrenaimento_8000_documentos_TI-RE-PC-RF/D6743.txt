#ITI#Water and nitrate movement in drip-irrigated onion under fertigation and irrigation treatments#FTI#
#IRE#Frequent fertigation of crops is often advocated in the technical and popular literature, but there is limited evidence of the benefits of high-frequency fertigation. Field experiments were conducted on an Indo-American Hybrid var., Creole Red, of onion crop during three winter seasons of 1999-2000 through 2001-2002 in coarse-textured soil of Delhi under the semi-arid region of India. Three irrigation levels of 60, 80 and 100% of the crop evapotranspiration (ET) and four fertigation frequencies of daily, alternate day, weekly and monthly comprised the fertigation treatment. Analysis of soil samples indicated considerable influence of fertigation frequency on NO 3-N distribution in soil profile. NO3-N in lower soil profiles (30.0-60.0 cm soil depth) was marginally affected in daily, alternate day and weekly fertigation. However, fluctuations of NO3-N content in 0.0-15.0, 15.0-30.0, 30.0-45.0 and 45.0-60.0 cm soil depth was more in monthly fertigation frequency. The level of soil NO3-N after the crop season shows that more NO3-N leached through the soil profile in monthly fertigation frequency. Amounts of irrigation water applied in three irrigation treatments proved to be too small to cause significant differences in the content of NO3-N leached beyond rooting depth of onion. Yield of onion was not significantly affected in daily, alternate day and weekly fertigation, though there was a trend of lower yields with monthly fertigation. The highest yield was recorded in daily fertigation (28.74 t ha-1) followed by alternate day fertigation (28.4 t ha-1). Lowest yield was recorded in monthly fertigation frequency (21.4 t ha-1). Application of 56.4 cm irrigation water and 3.4 kg ha-1 urea per fertigation (daily) resulted in highest yield of onion with less leaching of NO 3-N. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
