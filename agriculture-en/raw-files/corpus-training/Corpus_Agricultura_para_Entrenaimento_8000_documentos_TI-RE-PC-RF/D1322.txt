#ITI#Seeding ratios and phosphate fertilizer on ecosystem carbon exchange of common vetch and oat#FTI#
#IRE#Few studies have investigated the effect of phosphate (P) fertilizer on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its components under mixed legume and grass pastures sown, which will limit our understanding about their effects on carbon (C) sequestration in soils. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that a combination of legumes with grass and P fertilizer increases NEE due to greater increases in gross primary productivity (GPP) compared to increases in ecosystem respiration (Re).We measured NEE, GPP and Re under 5 different seeding ratios of oat (Avena sativa L.) and common vetch (Vicia sativa L.) according to their thousand kernel weight and germination rate (i.e., seeding rate were: M1: 0:150, M2: 150:105, M3: 300:75, M4: 450:45 and M5: 600:0) with and P unfertilized on the Tibetan Plateau from 2011 to 2013. NEE was measured at 1-week intervals from June to September each year using a transparent chamber technique (Licor-6400). Our results showed that both P fertilizer and mixed ratio had significant effect on NEE, Re and GPP, but their interactive effects were not significant during the growing season. P fertilizer primarily increased NEE due to increased GPP for the monoculture and mixtures with a higher proportion of common vetch. NEE, Re and GPP were higher for the mixed pastures only compared with legume monoculture. From the perspective of forage yield and C sequestration, planting mixed legume-grass pastures with P fertilizer is a preferable way to balance the twin objectives of forage production and C sequestration in alpine regions. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
