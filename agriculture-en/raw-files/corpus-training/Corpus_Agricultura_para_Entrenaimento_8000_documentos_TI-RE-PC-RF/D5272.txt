#ITI#Cold-adapted strain of avian pneumovirus as a vaccine in one-day-old Turkeys and the effect of inoculation routes#FTI#
#IRE#To determine the optimum route of vaccination, we inoculated 1-day-old turkeys with a cold-adapted strain of avian pneumovirus (APV) by oculonasal, oral, or aerosol route. Another two groups served as nonvaccinated-challenged and nonvaccinated-non-challenged groups. Birds in all vaccinated and nonvaccinated-challenged groups were challenged with virulent APV 3 wk postvaccination. After challenge, no vaccinated bird developed clinical signs or virus shedding, whereas nonvaccinated-challenged birds developed clinical signs (clinical score = 11.2/bird) and shed virus from their choanal cleft. Birds in all three vaccinated groups seroconverted at 3 wk postvaccination. The nonvaccinated-nonchallenged group remained free of clinical signs and virus shedding and did not develop APV antibodies throughout the course of the study. These results suggest that this cold-adapted strain of APV is safe and effective in 1-day-old turkeys when given by any of the three routes.#FRE#
