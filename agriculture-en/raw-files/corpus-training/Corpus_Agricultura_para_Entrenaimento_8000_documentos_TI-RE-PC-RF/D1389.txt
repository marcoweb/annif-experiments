#ITI#An empirical model and scenario analysis of nitrous oxide emissions from a fertilised and grazed grassland site in Ireland#FTI#
#IRE#This paper describes an empirical model of soil-evolved nitrous oxide emissions inferred from data gathered in a 2-year rotational grazing experiment investigating emissions from a fertilised and grazed grassland site. The model was used to simulate daily and annual emissions for the 9-year period between 1994 and 2002 under different possible fertiliser application scenarios. As the model only requires a small number of commonly available site-specific data inputs, this facilitates its use at different geographical locations. This is the first empirical modelling of daily fluxes to give estimates of annual emissions. Results reveal a high interannual variability of emissions that increases with the amount of nitrogen fertiliser applied. Simulation using the model for the period 1994-2002 indicated that higher soil moisture status on the day of fertiliser N application increased the average annual nitrous oxide emissions.
