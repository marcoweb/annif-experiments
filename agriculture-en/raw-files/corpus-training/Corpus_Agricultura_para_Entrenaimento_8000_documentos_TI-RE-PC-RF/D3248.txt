#ITI#Comparative study of five legume species under drought conditions#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Vegetative, reproductive and grain-filling phases are critical developmental stages determined legume’s yield and grain quality. Drought is the key factor affecting legumes ontogeny and production. The main goal of the present study is to compare growth, yield and seed quality of different legume species grown under drought conditions. Methods: Completely randomized design were used in this experiment with five local legume species including faba bean, chickpea, lentil, common vetch and bitter vetch, with five replicates using a net plot size of 20 m2 area (4m*5m) / replicate. Plants were grown at the eastern slopes of Bethlehem governorate (Latitude 31"67, Longitude, 35"24, Altitude of 629 m, with hilly-moderate to steep slope topography) under drought conditions (average rainfall is 260 mm). Growth performance (germination, flowering, fruit set, maturation, harvesting, stem length and branching), yield components (weight of 100-seeds, fresh weight, seed and hay production) and seed quality traits (percentages of dry weight, protein and ash) were evaluated. Result: Significant morphological, yield and grain quality parameters among the evaluated legume genotypes were registered. Positive correlation between branching and total yield was obtained. For economical and sustainable legume grain production, bitter vetch and common vetch could be successfully recommended under drought conditions, whereas faba bean and chickpea cultivation should be excluded from severe drought regions. Significant higher protein content in common vetch, faba bean and lentil was obtained, meanwhile the proximate analysis (dry matter, protein and ash) of the five examined crops found to be slightly high but within the documented international percentage range. Drought seems to be the main factor affecting legumes ontogeny and production, but not the quality parameters. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
