#ITI#Benefits and risks of using a combination of sewage sludge and chemical fertilizer on rice in acid sulfate soil#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were conducted in acid sulfate soils in the Central Plain of Thailand to study a combination of sewage sludge and urea as nitrogen sources for rice. Rice yield, nitrogen mineralization, heavy metal available and uptake were quantified. The experiment design was a split plot in 2Ã—4 factorial design. Two rates of nitrogen (75 and 150 kg N ha-1) were assigned to main plots and four combinations of urea and sewage sludge as source of N to subplots. The four combinations were in % of N from urea (U) and from sewage sludge (S), as follows: 33% N from U + 67% N from S, 67% N from U + 33% N from S, 100% N from U + 0% N from S, and 0% N from U + 100% N from S. Nitrogen mineralization in these treatments was tested in both open and closed systems to study N balance at different growth stages of rice. The results showed that nitrogen at 75 kg N ha-1 gave a better grain yield than at 150 kg N ha-1 and control (0 kg N ha-1). At the higher nitrogen application rate, an increase in the biomass with reduced grain yield was observed. Among the sources of N, the combination of urea 33% N and sewage sludge 67% N resulted in highest grain yield. Nitrogen mineralization of sewage sludge in acid sulfate soil was low. Nitrogen mineralization from urea and urea combination with sludge treatment were greater than sewage sludge application alone. Due to low extractable heavy metals in sewage sludge applied soil, the heavy metal content in milled grain and straw were below allowable limits set by US standards. Results indicated that a combination of urea and quality sewage sludge could be used as a fertilizer nitrogen source for rice, without risks associated with toxic heavy metals.#FRE#
