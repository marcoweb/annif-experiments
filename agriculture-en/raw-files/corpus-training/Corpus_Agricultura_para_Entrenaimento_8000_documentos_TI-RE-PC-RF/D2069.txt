#ITI#A model of ammonia volatilisation from a dairy farm: An examination of abatement strategies#FTI#
#IRE#A model (MAST) to calculate the mass flow of NH3 through a model dairy farm has been developed. Updated emission factors for UK agriculture were used to examine different abatement strategies available for a typical dairy farm. A range of annual NH3 emissions was calculated for both slurry and FYM based dairy systems. Emission for the slurry based system ranged between 27 kg NH3-N ha-1 yr-1, achieved using a combination of abatement strategies, and 107 kg NH3-N ha-1yr-1, calculated for a 'worst case' scenario. For FYM, this range was between 33 and 86 kg NH3-N ha-1 yr-1. The greatest reductions were achieved by manipulating options linked to fertiliser usage and manure application.#FRE#
