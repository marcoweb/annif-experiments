#ITI#N fertilisation, soil type and cultivars effects on N use efficiency in tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotte]#FTI#
#IRE#Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotte] is a major staple crop in Ethiopia and a large proportion of the imported fertiliser is being applied to tef fields. However, since the 1980s the yield on farmers' fields has stagnated. Response of the crop to applied fertiliser is influenced by several factors. We aimed to study the fertiliser N use efficiency (FNUE) of four tef varieties from ammonium sulphate and urea on different soil types with the help of the 15N isotopic dilution technique. Three experiments were conducted under greenhouse and field conditions. On a typic Eutrocrept soil, higher percent N derived from fertiliser (% Ndff) and % FNUE were obtained for all the tested tef varieties when the N source was urea, while percent N derived from soil (% Ndfs) was higher for ammonium sulphate. The mean % FNUE for urea and ammonium sulphate was 49 and 34%, respectively. When the varieties were grown on a Nitosol or a Vertisol and ammonium sulphate was applied, the % Ndff, the total and fertiliser N yield and % FNUE of the tef varieties were higher on a eutric Nitosol compared to the Vertisol. The mean % FNUE was 61.3 for the Nitosol and 27.8 for the Vertisol. In an 'on farm' experiment, relatively higher FNUE (33.3%) was obtained on an Andosol compared to Vertisols (17 and 27%). The tested varieties showed no difference in FNUE. As tef is the most important crop grown on Vertisols in Ethiopia, the low FNUE has a direct negative implication for the livelihood of the farmers and the environment. Â© Springer 2005.#FRE#
