#ITI#Stable isotope techniques for quantifying N fertiliser recovery in maize grown in soils with different management histories#FTI#
#IRE#The 15 N natural abundance (NA) method is increasingly used to quantify fertiliser N recovery by crops, even though this method does not always provide comparable results to those obtained using 15 N-enrichment (EN). This study assessed the ability of both methods to quantify urea-N recovery by maize (Zea mays) in soils with different management histories. A pot experiment was conducted using eight soils that differed in tillage, stubble management, and N fertiliser use history. Urea-N (unlabelled or 15 N-enriched at 10 atom-%) was applied at a rate equivalent to 150 kg N ha−1 prior to sowing maize. Method comparison was based on N recovery efficiency (REN) and N derived from fertiliser (Ndff). Maize grown in soils without fertiliser N history had significantly higher δ15N and Ndff but lower REN, than soils with fertiliser N histories. The NA method also consistently estimated 10% lower REN and Ndff than the EN method regardless of management history, although fertiliser N history affected the relationship between the methods. A highly significant linear relationship was obtained for REN measured using NA and EN methods (R2 = 0.98) in soils without fertiliser N history, but no relationship was apparent for soils with a long fertiliser N history. In conclusion, (1) the significant effect of fertiliser N history on the isotopic signature of soil N will limit the use of the NA method if soils with different N fertiliser histories are studied; and (2) REN and Ndff determined by NA were consistently lower than the EN method. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
