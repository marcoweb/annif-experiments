#ITI#Melatonin promotes the recovery of apple plants after waterlogging by shaping the structure and function of the rhizosphere microbiome#FTI#
#IRE#The dynamics of the physiological adaptability of plants and the rhizosphere soil environment after waterlogging remain unclear. Here we investigated the mechanisms regulating plant condition and shaping of the rhizosphere microbiome in a pot experiment. In the experiment, we added melatonin to waterlogged plants, which promoted waterlogging relief. The treatment significantly enhanced photosynthesis and the antioxidant capacity of apple plants, and significantly promoted nitrogen (N) utilization efficiency by upregulating genes related to N transport and metabolism. Multiperiod soil microbiome analysis showed the dynamic effects of melatonin on the diversity of the microbial community during waterlogging recovery. Random forest and linear regression analyses were used to screen for potential beneficial bacteria (e.g., Azoarcus, Pseudomonas and Nocardioides) specifically regulated by melatonin and revealed a positive correlation with soil nutrient levels and plant growth. Furthermore, metagenomic analyses revealed the regulatory effects of melatonin on genes involved in N cycling in soil. Melatonin positively contributed to the accumulation of plant dry weight by upregulating the expression of nifD and nifK (N fixation). In summary, melatonin positively regulates physiological functions in plants and the structure and function of the microbial community; it promoted the recovery of apple plants after waterlogging stress.
