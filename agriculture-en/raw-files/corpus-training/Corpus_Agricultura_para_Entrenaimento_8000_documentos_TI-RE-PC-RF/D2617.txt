#ITI#Evaluation of different herbicides against weeds in mungbean (Vigna radiata l.)#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during kharif season of 2016 at Mahatma Gandhi Chitrakoot Gramodaya Vishwavidyalaya, Chitrakoot, Satna (M.P.) to study the efficacy of different herbicides against weeds in mungbean. The weed density recorded at 30 and 60 DAS was significantly lower under pendimethalin 30 EC + imazethapyr 2 EC (Ready mix) 0.75 kg/ha as pre-emergence (PE) followed by pendimethalin PE. However, significantly lower weed dry weight and statistically superior weed control efficiency were noted in twice hand weeding at 20 DAS and 40 DAS and pendimethalin + imazethapyr (R.mix.) 0.75 kg/ha at same stages of crop (30 and 60 DAS). While, yield attributes viz. pods/plant (21.8) was significantly higher in plot treated with imazethapyr 10 SL @ 40g/ha applied at 20 DAS and statistically at par with imazamox 35 WG+ imazethapyr 35 WG 60g/ha applied at 20 DAS and clodinafop-propargyl 8% + aciflourfen-sodium 16.5% (WP) 187.5 kg/ha applied at 20 DAS. Application of clodinafop-propargyl 8% + aciflourfen-sodium 16.5% (WP) 187.5 kg/ha at 20 DAS produced significantly maximum seed yield (531 kg/ha) of mungbean closely followed by imazethapyr 10 SL @ 40g/ha at (528 kg/ha) and pendimethalin 30 EC + imazethapyr 2 EC (R.mix) 0.75 kg/ha (521 kg/ha). However, stover yield (2699 kg/ha), gross returns (`58464/ha) and net returns (`43163/ha) were obtained significantly superior under clodinafop-propargyl 8% + aciflourfen-sodium 16.5% (WP) 187.5 g/ha.
