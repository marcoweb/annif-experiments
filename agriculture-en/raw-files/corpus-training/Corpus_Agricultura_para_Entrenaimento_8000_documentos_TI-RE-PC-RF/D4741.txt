#ITI#Protection of chickens from Newcastle disease and infectious laryngotracheitis with a recombinant fowlpox virus co-expressing the F, HN genes of Newcastle disease virus and gB gene of infectious laryngotracheitis virus#FTI#
#IRE#A recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV) coexpressing the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) fusion and hemagglutininneuraminidase genes and infectious laryngothracheitis virus (ILTV) glycoprotein B gene was constructed. This virus was then evaluated for its ability to protect specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens against clinical symptoms and death after challenge by virulent NDV and ILTV. SPF chickens were grouped and vaccinated with the rFPV and commercial NDV (La Sota) and ILTV attenuated live vaccine (Nobilis ILT), respectively. After challenge with NDV 10 days postvaccination, 70% of chickens vaccinated with rFPV were protected from death, whereas 100% of the commercial NDV-vaccinated chickens were protected from death. In contrast, 100% of the unvaccinated chickens died after challenge. After challenge with ILTV, both the rFPV and commercial ILTV-vaccinated chickens were completely protected from death and 70% of chickens were protected from respiratory signs. In comparison, 100% of the unvaccinated chickens developed severe respiratory disease and 10% of chickens died. The protective efficacy was also measured by the antibody responses and isolation of challenge viruses. Results showed that this rFPV could be a potential vaccine for preventing NDV and ILTV by a single immunization.#FRE#
