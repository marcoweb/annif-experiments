#ITI#Sucrose accumulation and endodormancy are synchronized events induced by the short-day photoperiod in grapevine buds#FTI#
#IRE#At the end of the summer season, grapevine buds (Vitis vinifera L) grown in temperate climates enter a state of winter recess or endodormancy (ED), which is induced by the shortening of the photoperiod, and during this period, the buds accumulate sucrose. In this study, we investigated whether the shortening of the photoperiod regulates the accumulation of sucrose in the buds in the same way as it regulates its entry into the ED. Because sucrose accumulation is regulated by genes that control its transport and degradation, the effect of the SD photoperiod and the transition of buds from paradormancy (PD) to ED on the expression of sucrose transporter (VvSUTs) and invertase genes (VvINVs) was studied. To analyze the possible role of sucrose during ED development, its effect on bud swelling and sprouting was studied on dormant and nondormant buds under forced growth conditions. The results showed that the SD photoperiod upregulates the expression of the VvSUT genes and downregulates that of the VvINV genes in grapevine buds. Additionally, during the transition of buds from PD to ED, the sucrose content increased, the expression of the VvINV genes decreased, and the expression of the VvSUT genes did not change significantly. Sucrose delayed bud swelling and sprouting when applied to dormant buds but had no effect when applied to nondormant buds. Therefore, we concluded that ED development and sucrose accumulation were synchronized events induced by the SD photoperiod and that a sucrose peak marks the end of ED development in grapevine buds. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
