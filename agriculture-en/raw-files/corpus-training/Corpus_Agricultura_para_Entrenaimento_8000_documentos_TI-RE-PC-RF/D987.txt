#ITI#Growth physiology and chlorophyll fluorescence analysis of two moss species under different LED light qualities#FTI#
#IRE#This study investigated the responses of Didymodon constrictus and Hypnum plumaeforme to different light qualities emitted by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), including white light (WL), red light (RL), blue light (BL), yellow light (YL), green light (GL), and a combination of red and blue light (R1B1L). The research analyzed the fluorescence imaging, photosynthetic pigments, coloration, and growth characteristics related to antioxidant enzymes in these two moss species. The results indicated that R1B1L significantly enhanced the content of photosynthetic pigments, maximum relative electron transport rate (rETRmax), saturation light intensity (IK), and the greenness of the moss. RL improved the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm), the light energy efficiency of H. plumaeforme and effective quantum yield in both moss species. In contrast, BL notably increased non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), photochemical quenching (qp), and the steady-state fluorescence decrease ratio (RFD) in H. plumaeforme. The application of GL significantly increases the maximum photon yield (Fv/Fm) in D. constrictus, as well as the light energy efficiency and elongation length, resulting in a shift in the color composition of both moss species towards yellow. Among the light treatments, R1B1L had the highest induction rate and promotional effect on the growth of both moss species. These mosses absorbed GL and RL effectively, while BL played a crucial role in the dissipation of heat and electron transfer in H. plumaeforme. This research provides valuable insights for the regulation of LED light environments and the physiological adaptability of moss in artificial cultivation. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
