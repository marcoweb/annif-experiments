#ITI#Cell size and xylem differentiation regulating genes from Salicornia europaea contribute to plant salt tolerance#FTI#
#IRE#Cell wall is involved in plant growth and plays pivotal roles in plant adaptation to environmental stresses. Cell wall remodelling may be crucial to salt adaptation in the euhalophyte Salicornia europaea. However, the mechanism underlying this process is still unclear. Here, full-length transcriptome indicated cell wall-related genes were comprehensively regulated under salinity. The morphology and cell wall components in S. europaea shoot were largely modified under salinity. Through the weighted gene co-expression network analysis, SeXTH2 encoding xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases, and two SeLACs encoding laccases were focused. Meanwhile, SeEXPB was focused according to expansin activity and the expression profiling. Function analysis in Arabidopsis validated the functions of these genes in enhancing salt tolerance. SeXTH2 and SeEXPB overexpression led to larger cells and leaves with hemicellulose and pectin content alteration. SeLAC1 and SeLAC2 overexpression led to more xylem vessels, increased secondary cell wall thickness and lignin content. Notably, SeXTH2 transgenic rice exhibited enhanced salt tolerance and higher grain yield. Altogether, these genes may function in the succulence and lignification process in S. europaea. This work throws light on the regulatory mechanism of cell wall remodelling in S. europaea under salinity and provides potential strategies for improving crop salt tolerance and yields. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
