#ITI#Vineyard evaporative fraction based on eddy covariance in an arid desert region of Northwest China#FTI#
#IRE#Studying farmland evaporative fraction (EF) plays an important role in interpreting the components of energy budget and evapotranspiration (ET). The present study examines the pattern of vineyard EF after monitoring energy components by eddy covariance for 2 years, and estimates the crop ET by EF in the arid desert region of Northwest China. Main results indicate that EF during daytime is nearly constant on sunny days when the available energy exceeds 200 W m-2, but EF becomes relatively unsteady when the available energy is lower than 200 W m-2. Furthermore, daytime average EF is relatively low in the early growth stage, nearly constant in the mid-later stage, and significantly reduced in the later stage; Moreover, mean EF in different periods of daytime is in good agreement with daytime average EF, mean EF during 10:00-15:00 h is relatively close to daytime average EF and mean EF during 14:00-15:00 h is approximately equal to daytime average EF. The estimated daytime ET from mean EF during 14:00-15:00 h is highly correlated to the measured ET by Bowen ratio-energy balance though the value is partially underestimated. This study demonstrated that daytime ET can be estimated from midday EF and the relationship can be used to guide irrigation practice in the arid region. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
