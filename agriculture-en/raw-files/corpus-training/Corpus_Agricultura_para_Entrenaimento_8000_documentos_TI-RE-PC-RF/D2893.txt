#ITI#Identification and characterization of green gram [Vigna Radiata (L.) R. Wilczek.] photosensitive lines and their significance#FTI#
#IRE#One hundred and forty four accessions of green gram germplasm collected from middle Eastern Ghats were characterized and evaluated for 22 qualitative and quantitative traits during post rainy season of 2006-07 and rainy season of 2007. Three accessions (IC546478, IC546486 and IC369703) exhibited primitive characters such as photosensitivity, spreading growth habit and slight twining tendency, which differed significantly in comparison with the released varieties. Accession IC369703 was found promising for the quantitative traits viz. plant height (21.2 cm), primary branches (4.2) and pod clusters per plant (10.2) as against released varieties values ranging from 27-31.6cm, 1.4-2.4, 7.8-9.4 respectively. Based on the present study and previously reported archaeological evidences, it is proposed that green gram could have its origin in the cusp region of inner Western Ghats and inner Eastern Ghats.#FRE#
