#ITI#The occurrence and distribution of Salmonella enteritidis and other serovars on California egg laying premises: A comparison of two sampling methods and two culturing techniques#FTI#
#IRE#Between the summer of 1998 and the winter of 2000, Salmonella analysis was performed on 2128 single and 532 pooled manure drag swabs obtained from 133 California commercial egg laying farms. The isolation of Salmonella from all rows and from all flocks using single or pooled swabs was 80% and 92%, respectively. Hence, there was no statistical difference between single vs. pooled swabs in terms of identifying Salmonella on a row or flock basis. A total of 14 serogroups comprising 44 serotypes were isolated from 123 of 133 farms. When the top 10 serotypes were considered, there was no significant difference in the range of serotypes isolated by the two culturing methods. The overall S. enteritidis prevalence for California flocks was 10.5% (14/133). The overall row prevalence for S. enteritidis for all the farms was 1.1% (24/2128), and the overall pool prevalence was 2.4% (13/532). Sixty percent (12/20) of the S. enteritidis isolates from the positive farms were phage type 4, and 40% (8/20) represented five other phage types (1, 6B, 7, 8, and 28).#FRE#
