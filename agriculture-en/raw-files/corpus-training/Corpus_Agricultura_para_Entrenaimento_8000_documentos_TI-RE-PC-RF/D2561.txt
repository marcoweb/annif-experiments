#ITI#Genotype × environment (Gxe) interaction and stability analysis of diverse elite kabuli chickpea lines for phenological and yield related traits under normal and heat stress environment#FTI#
#IRE#68 kabuli chickpea lines were studied for different traits to know the role of genotype x environment (G×E) interaction and analyze stability under high temperature across the normal, late and very late planting dates at JNKVV, Jabalpur during rabi 2014-15. Differences among genotypes were significant for all traits; G×E interaction showed significant differences for days to maturity and seed yield. Variance due to environment found significant for all characters except days to maturity. G×E interaction (linear) exhibited significant differences for days to maturity and seed yield. Pooled deviation found significant for seed yield. Promising lines viz., CSJK46, PhuleG0517, ICCV13310, ICCV13312, FLIP-07-236C, FLIP-07-283C, FLIP-07-286C, JGK1, JGK 25 and JGK 26 found stable for most of the characters and may be grown under wide range of environments including high temperature conditions. ICCV13312 and JGK26 found highly stable with mean values greater than grand mean and regression coefficient lesser than one with deviation from regression minimum. Genotypes HK10-109, IPCK2009-145, CSJK4, PKV4, ICCV13306, ICCV13303, JGK24, JGK23 and JGK3 found most promising lines in minimum yield reduction in all planting dates. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
