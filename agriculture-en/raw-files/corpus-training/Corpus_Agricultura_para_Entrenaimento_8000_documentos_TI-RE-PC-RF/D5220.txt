#ITI#Infection of turkeys with Histomonas meleagridis by the cloacal drop method#FTI#
#IRE#The infection of turkeys with Histomonas meleagridis was attempted in the absence of its normal vector Heterakis gallinarum, using several experimental techniques. Battery-reared poults were inoculated at 2 wk of age with histomonads cultured in vitro, by several routes, including (a) per os (PO), (b) intracloacal (CI), and (c) cloacal drop (CD). Feed restriction was also studied as a predisposing factor. Intracloacal inoculation (CI) consistently produced severe infections in all experiments. In several experiments, turkeys did not become infected after inoculation PO with 1 Ã— 105 cultured histomonads. Feed restriction prior to inoculation did not make turkeys susceptible to infection inoculated PO. However, when liquid cultures containing histomonads were applied to the vent (CD) and the dorsal lip stimulated to initiate cloacal drinking, the histomonads were taken into the cloaca and transported to the ceca by retrograde peristalsis. Heavy infections were produced by this method, with severe liver and cecal lesions recorded when birds were necropsied 12 days later. These results suggest that CD may provide ready entry into the lower intestinal tract for these parasites and may facilitate spread of infection through flocks.#FRE#
