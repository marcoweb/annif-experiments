#ITI#Evaluation of neuraminidase antigen based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in chickens vaccinated with avian influenza inactivated vaccine#FTI#
#IRE#A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) was developed as a serologic diagnostic tool to detect antibodies against NA subtype 3 of avian influenza virus (AIV). The NA antigen used in this c-ELISA was obtained by pronase treatment of allantoic fluid of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) eggs infected with AIV. The NA specific monoclonal antibodies were produced from purified NA. The N3 c-ELISA was carried out on serum samples collected from both SPF chickens and commercial layers to confirm whether the N3 c-ELISA was capable of detecting specific N3 antibodies. The positive cutoff percentage inhibition value was 6.13%. The sensitivity and specificity of the N3 c-ELISA were 83.7% and 95.6%, respectively, which indicated that N3 c-ELISA can detect the antibodies from SPF chickens or commercial chickens vaccinated with H9N3 subtype of AIV.
