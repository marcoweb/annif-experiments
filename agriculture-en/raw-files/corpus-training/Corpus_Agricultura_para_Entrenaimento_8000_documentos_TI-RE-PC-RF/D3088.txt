#ITI#Improving Peanut Growth and Yield Responses with Monoseeding and Paclobutrazol Applications in Southern China#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Peanut yields are affected by plant density and chemical controls. Methods: A field experiment was conducted in Southern China to investigate the effects of population density and paclobutrazol applications on the growth and yield of peanuts with monoseeding and double seeding patterns. Result: Paclobutrazol application could improve peanut yields. The highest peanut yields were observed with 250 mg L-1 paclobutrazol and a plant density of 235 410 plants ha-1, with the monoseeding pattern. Our results suggest that monoseeding and paclobutrazol could be applied to enhance peanut yields in Southern China. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
