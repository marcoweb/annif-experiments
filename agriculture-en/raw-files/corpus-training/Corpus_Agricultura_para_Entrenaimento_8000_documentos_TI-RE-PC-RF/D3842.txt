#ITI#Degradation rate of chloridazon in soil as influenced by adjuvants#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of an adjuvant addition on chloridazon degradation rate in soil. The experiment was carried out under controlled laboratory conditions. Chloridazon was applied alone and in a mixture with three different adjuvants: oil, surfactant and multicomponent (used for preemergence application). Chloridazon residue was analysed using gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC/ECD). Good linearity was found between logarithmic concentration of chloridazon residues and time. The addition of oil and surfactant adjuvants slowed down the degradation of chloridazon in soil. The DT 50 values for the mixture of chloridazon + oil and surfactant adjuvants was about 8-14 days higher in comparison with the DT 50 for chloridazon applied alone (43 days). No significant differences were observed between degradation rates and the DT 50 for chloridazon applied alone and with a multicomponent adjuvant.#FRE#
