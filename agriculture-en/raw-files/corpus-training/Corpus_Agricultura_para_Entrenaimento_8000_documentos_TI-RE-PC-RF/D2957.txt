#ITI#Estimation of genetic parameters and combining ability analysis in blackgram [Vigna mungo (L.) hepper]#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was carried out in blackgram using line x tester mating design to estimate the gca effect of parents (six lines and five testers) and sca effect of 30 hybrids for yield and its traits. Estimates of gca and sca variances, degree of dominance, predictability ratio and narrow sense heritability revealed that only three trais viz., pods per plant, seeds per pod and single plant yield were controlled by additive gene action and hence showed high narrow sense heritability. Magnitude of non-additive gene action was higher than the additive gene action for traits like plant height, days to 50% flowering, cluster per plant, 100 seed weight, days to maturity, branches per plant and pod length. Three parents ‘MDU1, ADT3 and LBG-752 were the best combiners and three crosses ‘MDU1 x VBN (Bg) 6, LBG-752 x VBN (Bg) 6, LBG-752 x Mash-114 showed high per se performance and significant positive sca for yield. For exploiting both additive and non-additive gene action recurrent selection to be followed to improve yield in blackgram. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
