#ITI#Heterotic growth of hybrids of Arabidopsis thaliana is enhanced by elevated atmospheric CO2#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: With the global atmospheric CO2 concentration on the rise, developing crops that can thrive in elevated CO2 has become paramount. We investigated the potential of hybridization as a strategy for creating crops with improved growth in predicted elevated atmospheric CO2. Methods: We grew parent accessions and their F1 hybrids of Arabidopsis thaliana in ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 and analyzed numerous growth traits to assess their productivity and underlying mechanisms. Results: The heterotic increase in total dry mass, relative growth rate and leaf net assimilation rate was significantly greater in elevated CO2 than in ambient CO2. The CO2 response of net assimilation rate was positively correlated with the CO2 response of leaf nitrogen productivity and with that of leaf traits such as leaf size and thickness, suggesting that hybridization-induced changes in leaf traits greatly affected the improved performance in elevated CO2. Conclusions: Vegetative growth of hybrids seems to be enhanced in elevated CO2 due to improved photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency compared with parents. The results suggest that hybrid crops should be well-suited for future conditions, but hybrid weeds may also be more competitive. © 2024 The Authors.
