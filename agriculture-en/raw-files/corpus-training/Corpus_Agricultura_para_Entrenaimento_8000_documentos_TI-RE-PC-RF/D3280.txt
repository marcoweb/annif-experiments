#ITI#Genetic diversity and population structure of two faba bean mutant populations based on AFLP markers#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Although induced mutagenesis can rapidly generate genetic diversity, every genotype responds differently to different mutagen treatments in induceing genetic diversity. This study assesses and compares the genetic diversity of two mutant faba bean populations. Methods: Two genotypes representing landrace (Hassawi 2) and inbred variety (ILB4347) were exposed to gamma radiation and diethyl sulfate (DES). Two hundred eighty-two samples derived from individual 140 M2 mutant plants of Hassawi 2 and ILB 4347 and two parental lines were characterized using 11 Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) primer combinations. Result: 89,820 bands within 2,083 polymorphic alleles were generated from the samples. Genetic diversity comparison of the mutant populations revealed that each genotype had varying responses to different treatments. The two genotypes had a relatively similar response to gamma radiation, while different responses were recorded in DES-derived mutant plants. Based on the Nei’s genetic distance, the populations were separated based on the genotypic origin. The population structure analyses showed that the Hassawi 2 and ILB4347 mutant populations were clustered into three and two groups, respectively. The difference in the number of clusters between the two mutant populations explains their breeding history. The present diversity considered as a valuable material used for breeding and conservation purposes. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
