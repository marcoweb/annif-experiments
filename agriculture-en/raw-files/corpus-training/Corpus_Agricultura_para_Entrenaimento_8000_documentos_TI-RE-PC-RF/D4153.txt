#ITI#Naturally occurring neoplasms in pigeons in a research colony: A retrospective study#FTI#
#IRE#This study reports the gross and microscopic pathology of naturally occurring neoplasms in adult pigeons that were presented for necropsy at the Indiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory from 2001 to 2011. The study population consisted of white carneau and mixed-breed pigeons used in behavioral studies in the Department of Psychological Sciences at Purdue University. Twelve types of neoplasms or proliferative disorders were identified in 28 of 83 pigeons (33.7%). Five pigeons had two or three types of neoplasms-proliferative disorders. Of the 83 pigeons, 11 (13.3%) had seminoma, five (6.0%) had thyroid adenoma, four (4.8%) had lymphoma, four (4.8%) had adenocarcinoma of female reproductive tract origin, two (2.4%) had pulmonary carcinoma, and two (2.4%) had cutaneous vascular hamartomas. Also identified were single incidences of dysgerminoma, mesothelioma, liposarcoma, cloacal papilloma, cloacal adenocarcinoma, and gizzard carcinoma. The most frequently occurring tumor was seminoma; 7/11 cases effaced both testicles and 3/11 cases had metastasis to the liver or kidney. The relatively high prevalence of neoplasms in pigeons in the present study is most likely related to the advanced ages of pigeons kept in the research colony.
