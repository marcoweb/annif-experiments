#ITI#Molecular tagging of botrytis grey mould disease in chickpea#FTI#
#IRE#Validation of two primers TA144 and TR29 for their linkage with botrytis grey mould resistance gene was studied in twenty genotypes of chickpea including resistant (GL10006) and susceptible (DCP92-3) checks. The genotypes were also scored for disease reaction under natural exposure at hot spot location. Molecular analysis with primers TA144 and TR29 showed polymorphic bands in GL10006 and DCP92-3. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primers are linked with resistance gene. The genotypes that showed amplicons with both the primers at same or nearby positions of resistant check were HK-2, HK-4, BG-1003, KAK-2 and GNG-1969 and indicated as resistant or moderately resistant ones. The above genotypes were also found resistant under natural field condition. Thus both the primers TA144 and TR29 showed good correlation with phenotypic evaluation in most of the genotypes studied. In future, more number of primers nearby the resistance gene(s) can be tried for their contribution towards overall disease reaction. Â© 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
