#ITI#Morphologic changes in chicken cells after in vitro exposure to Mycoplasma gallisepticum#FTI#
#IRE#Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) was used to expose chicken peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), red blood cells (RBCs), heterophils, and chicken tumor cells (MSB-1 and HD-11 cells). Incubation of PBLs with MG for 3 hr resulted in extensive clumping of lymphocytes. Incubation of the MSB-1 cells with MG also caused clumping of the cells, with many of the cells showing perforations and others showing capping of the surface projections. Incubation of RBCs with MG resulted in an altered cell surface morphology, a decrease in cell size, and perforation. There were no discernible changes on the surface of the heterophils and the HD-11 cells. However, the HD-11 cells appeared to have a decreased ability to attach to the surface of the plastic and to have a decreased ability to respond to chemoattractant fMLP after 24 hr of incubation. These results suggest that, under the conditions used, MG caused certain damage to peripheral blood cells and a significant decrease in chemotactic response in the HD-11 cells.#FRE#
