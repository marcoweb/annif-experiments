#ITI#Relative potential of seed yield component traits as selection criteria in the segregating generations of a desi × kabuli cross of chickpea#FTI#
#IRE#To assess the response to early generation selection in chickpea, a total of 150 F4 progenies derived from selection for total branches per plant, pods per plant, seeds per pod, seed yield per plant and 100-seed weight as independent selection criteria in F2 population of Pusa 362 (desi) × PG 0515 (kabuli) cross were evaluated along with their parents and unselected F2 bulk. The F2 population revealed high variability for all the yield components and transgressive segregation for all traits except 100-seed weight. Mean of the F4 families relative to the corresponding F2 plants was high, indicating effectiveness of early generation selection for all characters studied except branch number per plant. Significant correlated response for seed yield was also observed in F4. Based on realized response to selection as percentage of mean, realized heritability and realized generalized response values, we suggest utilization of pods per plant, seed yield per se and 100-seed weight as selection criteria in desi-kabuli introgression breeding for higher genetic gains. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
