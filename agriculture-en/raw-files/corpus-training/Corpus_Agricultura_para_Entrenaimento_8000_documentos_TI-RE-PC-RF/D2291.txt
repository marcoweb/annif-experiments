#ITI#Influence of long-term use of fertilizers and farmyard manure on the adsorption-desorption behaviour and bioavailability of phosphorus in soils#FTI#
#IRE#An understanding of the adsorption-desorption behaviour of phosphate (P) in soils after three decades of long-term fertilization would be an invaluable supplement to our knowledge of the chemistry of P in soils and would assist in developing P application strategies for successive crops. With this objective and within the framework of a long-term experiment, we collected surface soil samples (0-0.15 m) from agricultural crop land on which a rotation of maize-wheat-cowpea (fodder) crops had been grown for 32 years. The soil samples were investigated for adsorption and desorption behaviour of P, and the buffering capacities of soil samples were computed from the adsorption data. Soils differed widely in their P supply characteristics. Phosphate adsorption increased while percentage P adsorbed decreased gradually with increasing levels of added P. Adsorption maxima and the extent of P adsorption was at its maximum in unfertilized soil, and P adsorption decreased with increased P applications. The incorporation of farmyard manure with optimal P levels decreased P adsorption even more than a super-optimal application of P fertilizers. Bonding energy and Freundlich constant 'n' also decreased with increased P application and with the incorporation of farmyard manure. The adsorption and desorption of applied P were inversely related, and the soils that adsorbed P the most readily released it the least into the soil solution, and vice-versa. Computation of maximum buffering capacities (MBC) indicated that increased levels of P application decreased MBC and increased P supply in soil. The beneficial effects of an annual incorporation of farmyard manure with optimal P levels were clearly pronounced, and P availability in these soils was found to be even higher than the soil receiving the super-optimal application of P fertilizers. Various adsorption-desorption parameters were significantly related with the P uptake of different summer (rice, maize, soybean) and winter (wheat, berseem and raya) crops. Adsorption maxima, desorption maxima and maximum buffering capacity are the major parameters governing P availability in soils. Â© Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.#FRE#
