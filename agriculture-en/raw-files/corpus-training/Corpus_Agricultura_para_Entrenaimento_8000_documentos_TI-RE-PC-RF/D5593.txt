#ITI#Results of Salmonella isolation from poultry products, poultry, poultry environment, and other characteristics#FTI#
#IRE#Five hundred sixty-nine Salmonella were isolated out of 4745 samples from poultry products, poultry, and poultry environment in 1999 and 2000 from the Pacific northwest. These Salmonella were identified to their exact source, and some were serogrouped, serotyped, phage typed, and tested for antibiotic sensitivity. Food product samples tested included rinse water of spent hens and broilers and chicken ground meat. Poultry environment samples were hatchery fluff from the hatcheries where eggs of grandparent broiler breeders or parent broiler breeder eggs were hatched and drag swabs from poultry houses. Diagnostic samples were of liver or yolk sac contents collected at necropsy from the young chicks received in the laboratory. Of these samples tested, 569 were Salmonella positive (11.99%). Ninety-two Salmonella were serogrouped with polyvalent somatic antisera A-I and the polymerase chain reaction. Somatic serogroups B and C comprised 95.25% of all the Salmonella. Out of a total of 569 positive samples, 97 isolates of Salmonella were serotyped. A total of 16 serotypes and an unnamed Salmonella belonging to serogroup C1 were identified. The Salmonella serotypes were heidelberg (25.77%); kentucky (21.64%); montevideo (11.34%); hadar and enteritidis (5.15% each); infantis, typhimurium, ohio, and thompson (4.12% each); mbandaka and cerro (3.09% each); senftenberg (2.06%); berta, istanbul, indiana, and saintpaul (1.03% each); and an unnamed monomorphic Salmonella (2.06%). Ninety-two Salmonella were tested for drug sensitivity with nine different antimicrobials. All of the 92 Salmonella were resistant to erythromycin, lincomycin, and penicillin except one sample (S. berta), which was moderately sensitive to penicillin. All of the tested Salmonella were susceptible to sarafloxacin and ceftiofur. The percentages of Salmonella susceptible to sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, gentamicin, triple sulfa, and tetracycline were 97.83%, 92.39%, 86.96%, and 82.61%, respectively.#FRE#
