#ITI#Interaction effects of fructan and Salicylic acid on chickpea in both biochemical and traditional agronomic indicators#FTI#
#IRE#Starch and fructans are accumulated for carbohydrate storage in legumes, while fructans accumulated large amounts than starch. The uses of this natural and biodegradable material counteract stress as cheaper and safer alternatives. Therefore, fructan (F, 0.5 %) and salicylic acid (SA, 0.5 mM) priming were used as exogenous growth enhancers to stimulate chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) seed vigor against salt stress. The main aim of this study was to address whether priming chickpea with F, SA and F+SA could bring about supplementary benefits particularly against salt stress. Exogenous application of For SA-alone improved chickpea development in the presence of salt stress. Nevertheless, the best results in terms of growth, seed vigor and total phenolic – flavonoids, chlorophyll – carotenoids contents, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO) activities and lipid peroxidation level (LPO) were determined in the combined F+SA treatment against salt stress. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
