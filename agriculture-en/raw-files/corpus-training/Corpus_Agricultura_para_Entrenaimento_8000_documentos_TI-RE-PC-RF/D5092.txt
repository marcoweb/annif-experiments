#ITI#Relative ammonia concentrations, dust concentrations, and presence of Salmonella species and Escherichia coli inside and outside commercial layer facilities#FTI#
#IRE#Three air contaminants that may have serious health consequences to humans and poultry are ammonia, dust, and aerosolized bacteria. This study measured ammonia concentrations, dust concentrations, and the presence or absence of aerosolized Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli inside and outside five commercial layer facilities. The average outside ammonia concentration measurements decreased as the distance from the facility increased from 10 to 40 ft. The measurements at 10 ft from the facilities were consistently higher than the average concentrations inside the facilities. The ammonia measurement trends inside of the facilities were affected by the temperature-dependent ventilation systems. Average dust concentrations inside the five facilities were consistently below 2 mg/m3. Three facilities also experienced average outside dust concentrations at all measured distances below 2 mg/m 3. Two facilities had relatively high average dust measurements at 10 ft from ventilation fans (32.12 mg/m3 and 75.18 mg/ m3). Escherichia coli and Salmonella were isolated from the air inside all five facilities and outside the facilities up to 40 ft from the ventilation fans. In conclusion, dust concentrations may pose the largest risk to human and animal health at 10 ft away from the poultry facilities; risks associated with ammonia inhalation are greatest inside facilities during the coolest months of the year; and aerosolized bacteria are found inside and outside poultry facilities, but further work is needed to quantify the bacteria to further assess the health risk related to this issue.#FRE#
