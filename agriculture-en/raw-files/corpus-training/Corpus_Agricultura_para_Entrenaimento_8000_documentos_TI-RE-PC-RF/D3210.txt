#ITI#Comparative study of seed yield and seed quality of advanced lines and commercial varieties of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is one of the most important forage legumes in areas with acidic and nutrient poorer soils where alfalfa fails to growth. In 2010-2011 years period we studied four advanced lines and four commercial varieties of red clover, which are widely used in the production in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Our results showed that the variation in grain yield, thousand kernel weight and germination energy was under control of growth. Across genotypes seed yield in 2010 and 2011 was 205 and 223 kg ha-1, respectively. The highest yield of seed was obtained from second growth in the second year. Extreme precipitation during anthesis and grain filling and ripening in 2010 negatively affected red clover seed production. Advanced line DS-2 had the highest grain yield (234 kg ha-1) and thousand kernel weight (1.75 g). Low seeds yields of the tested genotypes are questioning the cost-effectiveness of red clover seed production at this site. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
