#ITI#Foliar application of different phosphorus sources for transplanted irrigated pigeonpea [cajanus cajan (L.)] in north western zone of Tamil Nadu#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were carried out to study the effect of foliar application of different sources of phosphorus on yield of transplanted redgram (Cajanus cajan) in June (Kharif) 2014 to 2015 and 2015 to 2016 at Regional Research Station, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Paiyur, Tamil Nadu. The treatments included different concentrations of different phosphorus sources like mono ammonium phosphate (MAP), di ammonium hosphate (DAP), all 19 as a foliar application at flowering phase. The results revealed that foliar application of 0.5% mono ammonium phosphate (MAP) at flower initiation and 15 days after first spray recorded higher growth and yield parameters such as number of branches per plant, no. of pods, no. of seeds pod1 and 100 seed weight resulting in higher grain yield of 2512 kg ha-1, net income of Rs. 95215/-and B:C ratio of 2.97.
