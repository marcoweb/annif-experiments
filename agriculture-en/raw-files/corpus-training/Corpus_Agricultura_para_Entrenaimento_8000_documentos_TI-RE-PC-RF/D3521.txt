#ITI#Evaluation of the effectiveness of different herbicides on weed invasion in the fields of triticale#FTI#
#IRE#One of the factors limiting crop growth is weeds. The weeds lead to a reduced performance of the crops. Chemical control methods are considered appropriate for controlling weeds. Therefore, in the fight to control weeds in triticale, the performance of the dual-purpose herbicide sulfosulfuron(Apirus®), mesosulfuron + idosulfuron(Atlantis®), metsulfuron methyl+sulfosulfuron(Total®) with surfactant and isoproton + diflufenican(Panther®) from the sulfonylurea group, and narrow leaf herbicides clodinafob-propargyl(Topik®), pinoxaden(New Axial®), diclofop-methyl(Iloxan®), pinoxaden + clodinafob-propagyl (Traxos ®), fenoxaprop-p-ethyl + mefen-pyper-d-ethyl(PumaSuper®), tralkoksidim(Grasb®) with 1 liter oil, flam-prop-m-isopropyl(Suffix BW®), and control treatment without herbicides were evaluated. The test was carried out in a randomized complete block design with four replications. Spraying was carried out using a back sprayer. For evaluation of ocular damage, the European Weed Research Council (EWRC) standard method was used. According to the performed studies, the narrow leaves of wild oat and barnyard grass were the dominant weeds. Results showed that all herbicide, except the herbicide tralkoksidim, were effective in weed control. The triticale yield was maintained with the use of these herbicides and none of herbicide had an adverse effect on the crop. In the first weeks of herbicide use, the triticale leaves appeared pale but this problem resolved over time. It seems that the herbicides discussed in this paper can be used on the triticale plant.#FRE#
