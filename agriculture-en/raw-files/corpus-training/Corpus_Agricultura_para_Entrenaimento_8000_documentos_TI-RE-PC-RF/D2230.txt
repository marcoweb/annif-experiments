#IRE#The transportation of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) from croplands to aquatic ecosystems potentially negatively influences water quality. Sustaining crop yields while decreasing the environmental impacts of the DON from nitrogen fertilizer application is a key challenge in sustainable agriculture. However, few field datasets have measured the lateral transportation of DON via hydrological routes under different nitrogen fertilizer applications, particularly in sloping croplands. Using lysimeter plots (8 × 4 m2), we measured DON loss via overland flow, interflow, and soil erosion under different fertilizer applications under a long-term field experiment. There were four treatments, including no fertilizer (CK), mineral fertilizer (NPK), mineral fertilizer combined with swine manure (MNPK), and mineral fertilizer combined with crop straw (CNPK). In comparison to the NPK treatment, the annual DON loss fluxes via overland flow, interflow, and soil erosion for the MNPK treatment were significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 68.8, 100.6, and 63.7%, respectively. Conversely, this was significantly decreased by 182.6, − 14.1, and 49.4%, respectively, under the CNPK treatment. Correspondingly, the yield-scaled total DON losses for the MNPK and CNPK treatments were significantly increased by 78.8 and − 18.2% compared to the NPK treatment (0.33 ± 0.04 kg N t−1 grain). Therefore, long-term continuous manure application is associated with an increased risk of DON environmental pollution. Alternatively, the incorporation of crop straw can be recommended as a means of decreasing DON pollution while maintaining crop yield. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
