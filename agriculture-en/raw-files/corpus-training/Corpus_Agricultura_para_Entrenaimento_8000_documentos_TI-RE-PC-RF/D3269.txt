#ITI#Comparative Functional and Numeric Response of Two Coccinellids (Coccinella septempunctata and Cheilomenes sexmaculata) Preying Cowpea Aphid (Aphis craccivora)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora Koch (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a plant lice known to commonly attack plants that causes loss by sucking sap from phloem and act as vector for viruses. The aphidophagous coccinellids are efficient in controlling the pestiferous population of aphids. The two coccinellid Coccinella septempunctata and Cheilomenes sexmaculata are efficient in predation of cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora in southern Rajasthan. The present study determined the response of prey consumption at different prey densities. Methods: To compute the functional and numeric response of the lady bird beetle on cowpea aphid, experiment was conducted in vitro by using cowpea potted plant in caged conditions at Department of Entomology, Rajasthan College of Agriculture during 2019-20. The cowpea pea plants were sown in small pots and were placed in aluminium insect cages having 15 cm ☓ 15 cm ☓ 15 cm size. The predatory potential of coccinellid grubs and adults were evaluated at six different prey densities (aphids per arena): 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 and 200 with 5 replications. Result: The grub and adults of C. septempunctata consumed more prey as compared to C. sexmaculata. Both the coccinellid showed Type II functional response when functional curve was plotted. The linear regression method suggested that C. septempunctata required less time to act upon prey as compared to C. sexmaculata. The C. septempunctata also showed more numeric response in terms of ECI [conversion efficiency of prey consumption (ECI) into biomass (egg)] at different prey densities. The fecundity in both the cases increased with the increased prey densities that eventually decreased after reaching the maximum egg laying capacity at prey density of 125 aphids. In all the cases it was found that consumption rate of predaceous beetle increased with increasing aphid population. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
