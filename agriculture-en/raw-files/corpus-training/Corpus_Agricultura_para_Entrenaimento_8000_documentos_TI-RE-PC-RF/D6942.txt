#ITI#The wheat yields and water-use efficiency in the Loess Plateau: Straw mulch and irrigation effects#FTI#
#IRE#The yield of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), one of the major crops planted in the Loess Plateau, China, is mainly affected by available water. Straw mulch and irrigation are efficient ways of influencing wheat yield and water-use efficiency. To develop better semiarid crop and water management practices, a 13-year experiment in spring wheat monoculture was conducted at the Dingxi Soil and Water Conservation Institute of the Loess Plateau. The influence of rainfall during the growing season (March-July) on yields of rain-fed wheat was studied for 13 years (1982-1992 and 1997-1998). The influence of straw mulch and irrigation on wheat yield, and water-use efficiency, was studied for 2 years (1997-1998). We found that growing season rainfall had a significant (P < 0.05) influence on biomass and grain yield of spring wheat in rain-fed conditions during the 13 years. Both biomass and grain yield were very low and varied significantly due to the low and significant variability of growing season rainfall. Straw mulch increased wheat yields significantly during both dry (1997) and wet (1998) years. It increased biomass and grain yield by 37 and 52%, respectively, in 1997, and by 20 and 26%, respectively, in 1998. Straw mulch also significantly decreased evapotranspiration (P < 0.05), soil water depletion (P < 0.01), and increased water-use efficiency (P < 0.001). Biomass and grain yield both increased (P < 0.01 orP < 0.001) with increasing irrigation in 1997 and 1998. The three irrigation levels increased the biomass yield from 34 to 66% in 1997, and from 34 to 77% in 1998. The irrigation levels also increased grain yield from 53 to 102% in 1997, and from 22 to 57% in 1998. Water-use efficiency for biomass and grain yield also increased with increasing irrigation. On the other hand, irrigation water-use efficiency for biomass and grain yield decreased with increasing irrigation. The results suggest that higher crop yields in the semiarid Loess Plateau may be achieved by using irrigation, or a proper combination of straw mulch and irrigation. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V.
