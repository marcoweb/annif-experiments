#ITI#Congeneric temperate orchids recruit similar—yet differentially abundant—endophytic bacterial communities that are uncoupled from soil, but linked to host phenology and population size#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Besides the beneficial plant-fungus symbiosis in mycorrhizal plants, bacteria also enhance plant fitness via tripartite interactions. While bacterial associations are presumably just as important for the obligate mycorrhizal family Orchidaceae, little is known about orchid associating bacteria (OAB). Methods: We examined the OAB communities of two, congeneric, terrestrial orchids, Platanthera cooperi and Platanthera praeclara, which represent widely disparate North American ecosystems. We tested whether they recruit distinct OAB communities, and whether variability in OAB communities can be linked to phenology, population size, or habitat soil. Genomic DNAs from roots of seedling, vegetative, and reproductive plants and from soil were subjected to Illumina sequencing of V4 and V5 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Results: We obtained 809 OAB Zero-radius Operational Taxonomic Units (ZOTUs). Despite an overlap of 209 ZOTUs that accounted for >75% relative abundances of their respective OAB communities, the overall community structures of the two orchids were distinct. Within each orchid, distinctions were detected in the OAB communities of large and small populations and the three phenological stages. The OAB ZOTUs were either absent or present with low abundances in soil associated with both orchids. Conclusions: The two orchids exhibited preferential recruitment of known growth-promoting OAB communities from soil. Their OAB communities also showed considerable overlap despite the large environmental and geographical separation of the two host taxa. Our results lend further support to the emerging evidence that not only the fungi, but root-associated bacteria also have functional importance for orchid ecology. © 2023 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
