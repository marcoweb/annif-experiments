#ITI#Effect of growth regulators on growth characters of summer greengram#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during summer season of 2004 to find out the effect of various plant growth regulators on growth of summer greengram. The results revealed that the spray of GA 3 20 ppm at 20 and 40 DAS was significantly superior for growth parameters viz. plant height (56.38 cm) at harvest, leaves per plant (20.44) and number of branches per plant (10.63) at harvest followed by the treatment of NAA 20 ppm at 20 and 40 DAS.#FRE#
