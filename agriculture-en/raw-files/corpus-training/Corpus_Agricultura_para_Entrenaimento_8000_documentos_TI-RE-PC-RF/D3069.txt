#ITI#Correlation and path coefficient analysis of yield and its component characters among different accessions of cluster bean [cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) taub.]#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was carried out to study the correlation between yield components and their direct and indirect effects on the vegetable pod yield in cluster bean using 100 accessions. The correlation study revealed significant positive association of vegetable pod yield and characters viz., pod weight, pod length, pod girth, pods per plant, pod clusters per plant, plant height, shelf life and 100 seed weight. Pod length, pods per plant, plant height and pod clusters per plant were the characters responsible for maximum vegetable pod yield by imparting highest direct effect in path coefficient analysis. The correlation was also positive for these characters. The direct effect of the traits indicated its true relationship with pod yield. Hence, emphasis should be given for these characters, while making selection for high yielding genotypes in cluster bean. Â© 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
