#ITI#Relative yield and zinc uptake by rice from zinc sulphate and zinc oxide coatings onto urea#FTI#
#IRE#Zinc (Zn) deficiency is prevalent worldwide and is a barrier to achieving yield goals in crops. It is also now recognized as a leading risk factor for disease in humans in developing countries. In general, soil application of 5-17 kg of Zn ha-1 year-1 as zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) or more is recommended. However, in developing rice growing countries of Asia, ZnSO4 of desired quality is not readily available and is also quite expensive, so the farmers generally fail to apply Zn, resulting in rice crop yield loss. Availability of Zn-coated urea guarantees not only the availability of quality Zn but also ensures its application. Field experiments were therefore conducted during the rice seasons of 2005 and 2006 at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, to evaluate the relative efficiency of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0% Zn as ZnSO4- or zinc oxide (ZnO)-coated ureas for rice. Soil application of ZnSO4 was also compared in 2006. Rice grain and straw yields, Zn concentrations in grain and straw, and Zn uptake by rice increased with the level of Zn coating onto urea. Crop response was the highest with 2.0% ZnSO4-coated urea, and higher than with the same rate of ZnO-coated urea, possibly related to the higher water solubility of Zn in ZnSO4. Crop response with ZnSO4-coated urea was also higher than with the same rate of ZnSO4 and urea applied separately to the soil. However, apparent recovery data suggest that 1.0% coating with ZnSO4 may be a better choice from the point of view of the utilization of applied Zn. Increased Zn concentrations in rice grain due to application of Zn-coated urea is important from the point of view of Zn nutrition of humans, since rice is the staple food in developing countries of Asia. Also, increased Zn concentrations in rice straw is of importance as regards cattle nutrition since in developing countries of Asia rice straw is the major feed for farm cattle.
