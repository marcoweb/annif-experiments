#ITI#Fumigant toxicity of lavandula stoechas L. Oil against three insect pests attacking stored products#FTI#
#IRE#Plant secondary metabolites play an important role in plant-insect interactions and therefore such compounds may have insecticidal activity against insects. The chemical composition of the essential oil from leaves and flowers of Lavandula stoechas grown in Kashan, Iran, was studied by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). 1,8-Cineole (7.02%), γ-Cadinene (5.33%), T-Cadinol (5.07%), p-Mentha-1-en-8-ol (5.02%) and Caryophyllene (5.01%) were found to be the major constituents of the oil. In fumigant toxicity tests with the essential oil against adults of Tribolium castaneum Herbst, Lasioderma serricorne F. and Rhyzopertha dominica F. at 27±1°C and 60±5% RH, it was observed that L. serricorne (LC50 = 3.835 μl/l) were significantly more susceptible than R. dominica (LC50 = 5.66 μl/l) and T. castaneum (LC50 = 39.685 μl/l) 24 h after treatment. In all cases, considerable differences in mortality of insects to essential oil vapor were observed with different concentrations and times. Mortality increased as the doses of essential oils and exposure period increased and after 72 h fumigations, greatest percentages of mortality were obtained. The findings indicate the strong insecticidal activity of L. stoechas oil and it may be used in grain storage against insects L. serricorne, R. dominica and T. castaneum.#FRE#
