#ITI#The mechanism of melatonin promotion on cucumber seedling growth at different nitrogen levels#FTI#
#IRE#The supply level of exogenous nitrogen has a very important influence on the growth and development of cucumber. Insufficient or excessive nitrogen application will lead to metabolic disorders in the body and affect the formation of yield. Therefore, it is of great scientific and practical significance to explore the corresponding mitigation measures. Melatonin (MT) is a multi-regulatory molecule with pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development. A large number of studies have shown that the appropriate amount of melatonin supplementation is beneficial to plant growth and development by promoting root development, delaying leaf senescence, and improving fruit yield. However, the study of MT function combined with a detailed physiological analysis of nitrogen (N) absorption and metabolism in cucumber plants needs further strengthening. We performed hydroponic tests at different nitrogen levels to determine the metabolic processes associated with the enhanced tolerance to nitrogen in melatonin-treated cucumber (Cucucumis sativus L.) seedlings. Cucumber seedlings were sprayed with 100 μM melatonin or water and treated with different nitrogen in the growth chamber for 7 days. Nitrogen deficiency significantly inhibited seedling growth, and this growth inhibition was partially alleviated by melatonin. The expression analysis of related carbon and nitrogen genes showed that the genes whose expression was significantly altered by melatonin were mainly related to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism. By enzyme activity and reactive oxygen content data analysis, melatonin-treated cucumber seedlings showed relatively stable carbon and nitrogen levels compared to untreated ones. In conclusion, MT can repair the impaired growth and development situation by regulating the nitrogen assimilation capacity and the balance between oxidation and oxidative metabolism and carbon metabolism in the cucumber under different nitrogen levels. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
