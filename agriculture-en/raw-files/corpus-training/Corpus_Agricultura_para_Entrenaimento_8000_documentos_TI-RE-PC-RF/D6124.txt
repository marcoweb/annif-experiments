#ITI#The origin of unusual chromosome constitutions among newly formed allopolyploids#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the study: Wide hybridization followed by spontaneous chromosome doubling of the resulting hybrids plays an important role in plant speciation. Such chromosome doubling is usually accomplished via unreduced gametes produced by altered meiosis, the so-called 'meiotic restitution'. Unreduced gametes are expected to carry somatic chromosome numbers and constitutions. However, it has been shown recently that new allopolyploids often carry unusual chromosome constitutions which include compensating and noncompensating nulli-tetrasomies and monotrisomies, and translocations of homoeologues. Methods: We have reanalyzed meiotic divisions in a wheat-rye hybrid by in situ probing with labeled DNA focusing on deviations from the standard pattern of meiotic restitution. Key results: In a typical first division restitution in a wide hybrid, there is no chromosome pairing, univalents separate sister chromatids in anaphase I, and there is no meiosis II. Here we illustrate that occasional pairing of homoeologous chromosomes in metaphase I, combined with separation of sister chromatids of univalents, generates diads with compensating nulli-disomies and associated translocations of homoeologues. Similarly, precocious metaphase I migration to the poles of some undivided univalents generates a wide range of noncompensating simple and complex nulli-disomies in the gametes. Conclusions: Both alterations to the standard pattern of meiotic restitution tend to maintain the somatic chromosome numbers in the gametes; chromosome constitutions are variable but mostly genetically balanced. This source of variation among progeny may be an important factor contributing to greater success of natural allopolyploids. © 2014 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
