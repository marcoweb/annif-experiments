#ITI#Effect of organics, bio and inorganic fertilizer on groundnut yield and its residue effect on succeeding wheat crop#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted at Agricultural Research Station, Dhari (Gujarat) during 1999-00 to 2002-03 to ascertain the effect of bio (Rhizobium and PSM) organics (FYM, castor cake) and inorganic fertilizers on groundnut yield and its residue effect on succeeding wheat crop and post harvest soil fertility. The results indicated that use of bio and organic fertilizers enhanced the yield of groundnut and wheat as well as sustained the soil fertility. It also gave higher total income and net realization.#FRE#
