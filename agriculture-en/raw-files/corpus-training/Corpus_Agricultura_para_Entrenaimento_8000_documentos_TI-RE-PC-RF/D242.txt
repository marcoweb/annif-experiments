#ITI#Nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide independently act in mitigating chromium stress in Triticum aestivum L. seedlings: Regulation of cell death, chromium uptake, antioxidant system, sulfur assimilation and proline metabolism#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, we have explored potential of a nitric oxide (NO) donor (SNP, sodium nitroprusside) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in curtailing stress of hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] in wheat seedlings. Cr(VI) stress caused a significant decline in growth (30%) and photosynthesis (13%) as a result of enhanced uptake of Cr(VI) and root tips cell death. Further, Cr(VI) stress also accelerated indices of oxidative stress but differentially regulated antioxidant system. But application of either NO or H2O2 separately significantly mitigated Cr(VI) stress by reducing cell death and Cr(VI) uptake in roots, and oxidative stress markers. The application of c-PTIO [2-(4-carboxy-2-phenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide, a scavenger of NO] and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (a scavenger of ROS) reserved alleviatory effect of NO and H2O2, respectively and thus further increased Cr(VI) toxicity. Application of diphenylene iodonium (DPI, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases) also further increased Cr(VI) toxicity. But SNP and H2O2 significantly rescued negative effects of DPI and c-PTIO, respectively under Cr(VI) stress. Overall results suggested that NO and H2O2 both independently act in mitigating Cr(VI) stress in wheat seedlings by minimizing cell death, restricting Cr(VI) uptake in roots, and increasing antioxidant system, sulfur assimilation and proline metabolism.
