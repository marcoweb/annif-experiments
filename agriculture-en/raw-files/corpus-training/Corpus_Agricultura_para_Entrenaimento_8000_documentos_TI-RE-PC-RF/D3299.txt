#ITI#Genetic diversity assessment in chickpea (Cicer arietinum l.) through agro-morphological and issr molecular markers#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), commonly known as gram or Bengal gram, is a self-pollinated diploid plant (2n= 2x= 16) ranked third after common bean and field pea. Genetic diversity assessment is the fundamental of any breeding programme, conservation of genetic resources and as a general guide for the choice of parents in hybrid breeding. The present investigation aimed to study the genetic diversity among 45 elite chickpea genotypes using agro-morphological traits and ISSR molecular markers. Methods: The experimental material comprised of 45 elite chickpea genotypes, grown in randomized block design (RBD) with three replications under natural field conditions at Research Farm of Pulses Section, CCSHAU, Hisar during Rabi 2014-15. Genetic divergence was studied using 11 agro-morphological traits by Non-hierarchical Euclidean cluster analysis and 25 ISSR primers using UPGMA based method. Result: Genetic divergence study based on agro-morphological traits and molecular markers showed ample amount of genetic variation among elite chickpea genotypes which were discussed and compared their diversity analysis as well. The present study confirmed the importance of agro-morphological traits and ISSR markers for detecting tremendous amount of genetic diversity in chickpea which may be used to select good parental material in chickpea breeding programmes for further improvement.
