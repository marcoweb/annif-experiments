#ITI#Unveiling the molecular regulatory mechanisms underlying sucrose accumulation and oil reduction in peanut kernels through genetic mapping and transcriptome analysis#FTI#
#IRE#Sucrose content is a key factor for the flavor of edible peanut, which determines the sweet taste of fresh peanut and also attribute to pleasant flavor of roasted peanut. To explore the genetic mechanism of the sucrose content in peanut, an F2 population was created by crossing the sweet cultivar Zhonghuatian 1 (ZHT1) with Nanyangbaipi (NYBP). A genomic region spanning 28.26 kb on chromosome A06 was identified for the sucrose content through genetic mapping, elucidating 47.5% phenotypic variance explained. As the sucrose content had a significantly negative correlation with the oil content, this region was also found to be related to the oil content explaining 37.2% of phenotype variation. In this region, Arahy.42CAD1 was characterized as the most likely candidate gene through a comprehensive analysis. The nuclear localization of Arahy.42CAD1 suggests its potential involvement in the regulation of gene expression for sucrose and oil contents in peanut. Transcriptome analysis of the developing seeds in both parents revealed that genes involved in glycolysis and triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathways were not significantly down-regulated in ZHT1, indicating that the sucrose accumulation was not attributed to the suppression of triacylglycerol biosynthesis. Based on the WGCNA analysis, Arahy.42CAD1 was co-expressed with the genes involved in vesicle transport and oil body assembly, suggesting that the sucrose accumulation may be caused by disruptions in TAG transportation or storage mechanisms. These findings offer new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing sucrose accumulation in peanut, and also provide a potential gene target for enhancing peanut flavor. © 2024 The Authors#FRE#
