#ITI#Infectious bursal disease subunit vaccination#FTI#
#IRE#Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is the causative agent of infectious bursal disease, a nosologic entity with global economic importance in poultry. The viral protein 2 (VP2) is recognized as the virus' major antigenic protein. The goal of this study was to generate yeast (Pichia pastoris)-based protein expression from the VP2 gene of the Edgar strain of IBDV and from the hypervariable region of the VP2 gene (hvVP2) to test the protection afforded against virulent IBDV challenge when inoculated in chickens. The genetic material used for protein expression was obtained from paraffin-embedded tissue. Specific-pathogen-free chickens were vaccinated with the expressed products and challenged with the homologous strain (Edgar). After challenge, no morbidity or mortality was observed in the birds vaccinated with the whole VP2, compared with 30% morbidity and mortality in the hvVP2-vaccinated birds and with 90% morbidity and 60% mortality in the unvaccinated, challenged controls. Immunohistochemistry detection of the challenge virus and some extent of bursal damage were observed in all challenged birds, indicating active replication of the challenge virus despite vaccination. As determined by bursal index values, the protection against postchallenge bursal atrophy was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the VP2 group than in the unvaccinated and hvVP2-vaccinated birds. Overall, the results indicated that paraffin-embedded tissue can be used as a source of genomic material for transgenic protein expression, that Pichia pastoris-expressed VP2 retains its immunogenicity, and that VP2 subunit vaccination conferred partial protection to challenge; it protected against clinical signs and death but not against IBDV infection.#FRE#
