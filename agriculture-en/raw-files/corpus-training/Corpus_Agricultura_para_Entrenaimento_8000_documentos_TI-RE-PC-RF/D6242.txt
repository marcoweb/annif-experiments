#ITI#Spatiotemporal features of microsporogenesis in the cycad species Macrozamia communis#FTI#
#IRE#PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Spatiotemporal features of microsporogenesis may provide important clues about the evolution of microsporogenesis in seed plants. One cellular feature that attracts special attention is advance cell wall ingrowths (ACWIs) at future cytokinetic sites in microsporocytes since they have been found only in species of an ancient lineage of angiosperms, Magnolia, and in much less detail, of an ancient lineage of gymnosperms, cycads. Further investigation into microsporogenesis in a cycad species may yield knowledge critical to understanding the establishment of ACWIs as an important feature for comparative studies of microsporogenesis in seed plants. METHODS: Bright-field and epifluorescence microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the microsporogenic process in Macrozamia communis, a species in the Zamiaceae family of cycads. KEY RESULTS: In prophase-II microsporocytes in M. communis, ACWIs form as a callose ring between the newly formed nuclei and are not accompanied by cytokinetic apparatuses such as mini-phragmoplasts, wide tubules, or wide tubular networks. Shortly after the second nuclear division, new ACWIs, albeit thinner than the previous ACWIs, form between the newly formed nuclei. Subsequent cell plate formation in the planes of the ACWIs typically results in tetragonal tetrads. CONCLUSIONS: Cytokinesis at the cell periphery is initiated earlier than cell plate formation in the cell interior in microsporogenesis in M. communis. The cellular features uncovered in M. communis may serve as useful reference features for comparative studies of microsporogenesis in plants. © 2015 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
