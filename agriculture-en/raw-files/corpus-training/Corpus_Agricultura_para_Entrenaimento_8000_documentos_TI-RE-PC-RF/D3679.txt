#ITI#Disappearance of azoxystrobin, cyprodinil, and fludioxonil residues on tomato leaves in a greenhouse#FTI#
#IRE#The objective of this work was to estimate the disappearance parameters of azoxystrobin, cyprodinil and fludioxonil initial deposits, active ingredients of Amistar 250 SC, and Switch 62,5 WG, at present, commonly used for the protection of fruits and vegetables against diseases of fungal origin. The tests were carried out on tomato plants grown in commercial greenhouses sprayed with homogenous 0.1% aqueous solution of these plant protection products. It was found that on tomato leaves azoxystrobin, cyprodinil, and fludioxonil residues dropped by half on average within 13, 9, and 31 days after treatments, respectively. Therefore, in conditions of high infection pressure, there is a need to repeat the fungicide application but not earlier than 10 days after previous application of Amistar 250 SC and Switch 62,5 WG.#FRE#
