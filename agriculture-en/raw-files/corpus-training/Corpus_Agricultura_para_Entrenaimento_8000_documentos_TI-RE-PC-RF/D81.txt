#ITI#Nitrogen addition modifies the relative gene expression level and accumulation of carbon-based bioactive substances in Cyclocarya paliurus#FTI#
#IRE#In China, lots of Cyclocarya paliurus plantations have been established for tea and functional food production on nitrogen (N)-limited land. The optimum N levels require for biosynthesis and accumulation of carbon-based bioactive substances vary among plant species. This study integrated field trial with hydroponic culture to assess impact of nitrogen addition on accumulation and relative gene expression level of carbon-based secondary metabolites in C. paliurus. N addition significantly influenced not only contents of polyphenols, flavonoids and triterpenoids and relative gene expression levels of their biosynthetic pathway in C. paliurus leaves but also leaf biomass production and the bioactive substance accumulations. An intermediate N addition induced the highest contents of polyphenols, flavonoids and triterpenoids in leaves, but the optimized accumulation of these bioactive substances in the leaves was the trade-off between their contents and leaf biomass production. Correlation analysis showed that related gene expression levels were closely correlated with contents of their leaf corresponding secondary metabolites. Compared with ratios of carbon/N (C/N) and carbon/phosphorus (C/P) in the soil, ratios of C/N and C/P in the leaves were more strongly related to the contents and accumulations of polyphenols, flavonoids and triterpenoids. To obtain higher yields of targeted phytochemicals, the threshold ratios of C/N and C/P in the leaves are recommended for N and P fertilization at similar sites. Overall, our findings would provide the theoretical basis and technical support for manipulating N fertilization in C. paliurus plantations to obtain higher accumulations of targeted bioactive substances.
