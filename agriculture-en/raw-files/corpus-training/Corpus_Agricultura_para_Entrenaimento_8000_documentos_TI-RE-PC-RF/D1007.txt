#ITI#Effects of superoxide radical on photosynthesis and K+ and redox homeostasis in quinoa and spinach#FTI#
#IRE#Methyl viologen (MV), also known as paraquat, is a widely used herbicide but has also been reported as highly toxic to different life forms. The mode of its operation is related to superoxide radical (O2.-) production and consequent oxidative damage. However, besides the damage to key macromolecules, reactive oxygen species (ROS; to which O2.- belongs) are also known as regulators of numerous ion transport systems located at cellular membranes. In this study, we used MV as a tool to probe the role of O2.- in regulating membrane-transport activity and systemic acquired tolerance in halophytic Chenopodium quinoa and glycophytic spinach plants. Both plant species showed growth reduction in terms of reduced shoot length, lower shoot fresh and dry weight, photosynthesis rate, and chlorophyll contents; however, quinoa showed less reduction in growth compared with spinach. This whole plant response was further examined by measuring the ion concentration, gene expression of ion transporters, activation of antioxidants, and osmolyte accumulation. We observed that at the mechanistic level, the differences in growth in response to MV were conferred by at least four complementary physiological mechanisms: (1) higher K+ loss from spinach leaves resulted from higher expression of MV-induced plasma membrane-based depolarization-activated K+ efflux GORK channel, (2) higher activation of high-affinity K+ uptake transporter HAK5 in quinoa, (3) higher antioxidant production and osmolyte accumulation in quinoa as compared with spinach, and (4) maintaining a higher rate of photosynthesis due to higher chlorophyll contents, and efficiency of photosystem II and reduced ROS and MDA contents. Obtained results also showed that MV induced O2.- significantly reduced N contents in both species but with more pronounced effects in glycophytic spinach. Taken together this study has shown the role of O2.- in regulating membrane ion transport and N metabolism in the leaves of halophyte vs. glycophyte in the context of oxidative stress tolerance. © 2024 The Authors#FRE#
