#ITI#High seroprevalence of respiratory pathogens in hobby poultry#FTI#
#IRE#Seroprevalence studies on respiratory pathogens have been done extensively in commercial laying hens, broilers, and, to a lesser extent, backyard poultry. In Europe, seroprevalence studies in backyard and fancy breed poultry flocks are scarce and limited to a few pathogens, such as Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG); others, such as Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (ORT), are missing. A commercial ELISA for detection of antibodies against six selected pathogens was performed on 460 serum samples from chickens across Flanders. Anti-ORT antibodies were, by far, the most prevalent, with a prevalence of 95.4%. Infectious bronchitis virus, Mycoplasma synoviae, and avian metapneumovirus antibodies were found in 75.6%, 76.3%, and 63.5% of the animals, respectively. Antibodies against MG and infectious laryngotracheitis virus were found in 36.7% and 30% of the animals, respectively. These data demonstrate the high seroprevalence of respiratory pathogens among hobby poultry; therefore, it is possible that this group could act as a reservoir for commercially kept poultry. © 2014 American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
