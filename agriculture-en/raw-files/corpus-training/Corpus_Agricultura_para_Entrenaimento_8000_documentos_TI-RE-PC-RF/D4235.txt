#ITI#Malignant sertoli cell tumor in a goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus)#FTI#
#IRE#This paper describes the pathologic features of a malignant Sertoli cell tumor found in an adult goose (Anser cygnoides domesticus). At necropsy, in addition to one large tumor mass (15 cm in diameter), multiple small tumor masses were observed over the peritoneum and mesenterium in the coelomic cavity. The large tumor mass was composed of sheets, lobules, and small islands of tumor cells, and elongated tumor cells lying perpendicular to fibrous connective tissue were characteristic. Such histopathologic characteristics were common to all the tumors. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for neuron-specific enolase and S-100, and some tumor cells contained fine intracytoplasmic pigments that stained red by oil red O staining. These findings, taken together with the fact that one testis was markedly atrophied and bore no tumor cells and the other testis was not discernible, the present case was diagnosed as unilateral malignant Sertoli cell tumor arising from the unilateral testis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Sertoli cell tumor in the goose. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists 2012.#FRE#
