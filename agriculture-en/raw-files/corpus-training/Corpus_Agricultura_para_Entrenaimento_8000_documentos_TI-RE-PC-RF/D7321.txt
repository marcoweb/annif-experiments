#ITI#Tillage system and time post-liquid dairy manure: Effects on runoff, sediment and nutrients losses#FTI#
#IRE#Liquid manure applied in agricultural lands improves soil quality. However, incorrect management of manure may cause environmental problems due to sediments and nutrients losses associated to runoff. The aims of this work were to: (i) evaluate the time effect of post-liquid dairy manure (LDM) application on runoff, sediment and nutrient losses; (ii) compare the effect of conventional tillage and no-till systems on runoff, sediment and nutrients losses after LDM application. A rainfall simulation experiment was conducted on intact soil blocks collected from fields that had been under conventional tillage and no-till systems. Rainfall was applied 24 h or 7 days after LDM application. Conventional tillage without manure application resulted on higher runoff, sediment and nutrient losses (mainly the particulate fraction) than no-till without manure. The greatest runoff, sediment and nutrients losses occurred in the treatments where simulated rainfall was performed 24 h after LDM application independent of the tillage system. An interval of 7 days between manure application and the rainfall event reduced sediment, particulate P, and particulate N losses in both conventional and no-till systems. In practical terms, we would recommend a minimum of 7 days between LDM application and rainfall-runoff event to provide agronomic benefits minimizing the potential risk of water pollution. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
