#ITI#Sertoli cell tumor associated with polyomavirus infection in a Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae)#FTI#
#IRE#A 3-yr-old male Gouldian finch (Erythrura gouldiae) died after 2 wk of lethargy, emaciation, feather loss, and abdominal distension. The bird was housed in an aviary for breeding, but it had shown loss of fertility in the previous breeding season. Necropsy revealed a gross, firm, and yellow mass involving the left testis. Histologically, the mass was a mixed form, intratubular and diffuse, Sertoli cell tumor. Some neoplastic cells had intranuclear inclusion bodies that immunoelectron microscopy proved to be polyomavirus particle aggregates. There were no viral inclusions in other tissues. The possible role of infection in the pathogenesis of the tumor is discussed.#FRE#
