#ITI#Survey, collection and seed morphometric characterization of French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) landraces of Himachal Pradesh#FTI#
#IRE#The study was conducted to survey and collect various French bean genotypes from the main hot spot regions of Himachal Pradesh like Shimla, Chamba, Sirmour, Kullu, Kinnaur and some areas of Mandi and Solan district. Different bean genotypes were collected in a 15-day exploration trip from various geographical regions. The collected seed samples were evaluated and characterized for intra-specific seed morpho-metric characteristics like seed coat colour, hilum colour, seed shape, hypocotyls pigmentation, cotyledon colour pubescence on hypocotyls, 100 seed weight (g), seed length (mm) and seed width (mm). The evaluated genetic material was then deposited in the short term seed bank of Department of Seed Science and Technology UHF Nauni for future correspondence. The genetic diversity found among the landraces is of great importance in the utilization of the species for food and nutrition and more importantly for genetic improvement. The study would prove a basic primary step in germplasm recognisition activity for future breeding programmes and will project the local available genetic footprints to entire agro associated enterprises for necessary consideration.
