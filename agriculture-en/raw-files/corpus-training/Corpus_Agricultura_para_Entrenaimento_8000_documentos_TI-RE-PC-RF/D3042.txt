#ITI#Production Potential and Economic Returns of Bed Planted Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) as Influenced by Different Intercropping Systems#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the third most important pulse crop produced after dry bean and peas in the world. Amongst pulses, chickpea is the major crop in India but for international market the quality of this crop has to be improved which may be possible by evaluation of different planting techniques. No systematic research and adequate technologies have been reported in Punjab on intercropping of different crops in chickpea. The current study aimed to find out the effect of different intercrops on growth and yield of bed planted chickpea based intercropping systems. Methods: A field experiment was carried out during the rabi season of 2017 and 2018 to evaluate the productivity and economic viability of bed planted chickpea based intercropping systems. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design consisting of four replications with thirteen treatments. Result: Results showed that sole chickpea recorded highest seed yield and it was statistically at par with seed yield that obtained under chickpea + oats fodder (2:1), chickpea + oats fodder (4:1) and chickpea + linseed (4:1) intercropping systems. However, oilseed rape and barley as intercrops showed adverse effect on yield and yield attributes of chickpea. Chickpea + oats fodder in 2:1 row ratio recorded highest chickpea equivalent yield of 24.07 and 24.77 q/ha and system productivity of 15.96 and 15.60 kg/ha/day during 2017 and 2018, respectively. Higher net returns (Rs. 63098 and 70924/ha), benefit cost ratio (1.47 and 1.63) and production efficiency (417.9 and 446.1 Rs/ha/day) were also recorded in chickpea + oats fodder (2:1) intercropping system over sole chickpea (Rs. 44862 and 53769/ha and 1.21 and 1.41) during both the years. Chickpea + oats fodder (4:1), chickpea + linseed (2:1) and chickpea + linseed (4:1) also recorded significantly higher chickpea equivalent yield, net returns and benefit cost ratio as compared to sole chickpea.
