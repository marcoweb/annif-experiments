#ITI#A monoterpene synthase gene cluster of tea plant (Camellia sinensis) potentially involved in constitutive and herbivore-induced terpene formation#FTI#
#IRE#Monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes are the most abundant volatiles in tea plants and have dual functions in aroma quality formation and defense responses in tea plants. Terpene synthases (TPS) are the key enzymes for the synthesis of terpenes in plants; however, the functions of most of them in tea plants are still unknown. In this study, six putative terpene biosynthesis gene clusters were identified from the tea plant genome. Then we cloned three new TPS-b subfamily genes, CsTPS08, CsTPS10 and CsTPS58. In vitro enzyme assays showed that CsTPS08 and CsTPS58 are two multiple-product terpene synthases, with the former synthesizing linalool as the main product, and β-myrcene, α-phellandrene, α-terpinolene, D-limonene, cis-β-ocimene, trans-β-ocimene and (4E,6Z)-allo-ocimene as minor products are also detected, while the latter catalyzing the formation of α-pinene and D-limonene using GPP as the substrate. No product of CsTPS10 was detected in the prokaryotic expression system, but geraniol production was detected when transiently expressed in tobacco leaves. CsTPS08 and CsTPS10 are two functional members of a monoterpene synthase gene cluster, which were significantly induced during both Ectropis oblique feeding and fresh leaf spreading treatments, suggesting that they have dual functions involved in tea plant pest defense and tea aroma quality regulation. In addition, the differences in their expression levels in different tea plant cultivars provide a possibility for the subsequent screening of tea plant resources with a specific aroma flavor. Our results deepen the understanding of terpenoid synthesis in tea plants. © 2022#FRE#
