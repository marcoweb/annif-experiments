#ITI#Improving groundwater recharge estimates in alfalfa fields of New Mexico with actual evapotranspiration measurements#FTI#
#IRE#Quantifying groundwater recharge from irrigation practices of arid regions is necessary for efficient and sustainable groundwater resources management. Recharge is difficult to measure directly, many studies have quantified recharge from agricultural fields as a residual of the soil water balance method (WBM) or by other mathematical models estimating evapotranspiration (ET) and measuring soil moisture, rainfall, and irrigation. ET is often estimated using weather parameters from climate stations that are distant from crops. Flooding of fields is the most common form of irrigation used by farmers in the Mesilla Valley, New Mexico to grow alfalfa, one of the state's major crops. The objectives of this study were to quantify recharge in flood irrigated alfalfa fields in the Mesilla Valley, New Mexico using the WBM and actual ET measurements during the 2017 growing season. The study fields were different sizes, crop ages, and soil textures. Actual ET of alfalfa was measured on the largest field using the eddy covariance − energy budget method and applied to the two other nearby fields as estimated ET. All other WBM parameters were measured at each study site (i.e. soil moisture, rainfall, and applied irrigation). Recharge using ET referenced to grass (ETsz) was then calculated using weather parameters and compared with measured ET. Recharge ranged from 618 to 716 mm with no significant statistical differences between the three alfalfa fields (f-ratio of 0.8876 and a p-value of 0.42 using ANOVA). Recharge to irrigation ratio ranged from 37% to 45%. On-farm irrigation efficiency ranged from 54.86% to 59.94%. When compared to measured ET, ETsz underestimated recharge of alfalfa by 11% in the WBM and overestimated recharge by 6% when a reduction in ETsz during harvest periods are considered. The results show that the measurement of actual ET improved recharge estimates in the alfalfa fields. © 2020 The Authors#FRE#
