#ITI#Identification and Molecular Characterization of Mung Bean Yellow Mosaic Virus in French Bean through Coat Protein Gene#FTI#
#IRE#Background: French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), is one of the important legume vegetables grown in India. The disease mung bean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) limits successful production of beans. MYMV has become an epidemic in bean growing regions, particularly in the tropical and subtropical countries. In summer, the disease is more serious and widely distributed and reported in various countries. The current study is aimed at identification of MYMV and molecular characterization of mung bean yellow mosaic virus in French bean. This study will be helpful for early detection of the virus, so that better preventive measures can be taken to control MYMV. Methods: The investigations were conducted during 2016-2017, all the agro climatic zones of Karnataka province were surveyed. The coat protein (CP) gene of MYMV was amplified using gene specific primer with DNA isolated from MYMV infected leaves samples in french bean. Polymerase chain reaction products were Sequenced and analysed using a bioinformatic tool. Result: The CP gene decrypt sequences analysis revealed that the identity and similarity in global alignment for all the obtained sequences ranging from 80.8 to 95.3% with reference to MYMV, whereas for horse gram yellow mosaic virus (HYMV) it ranges from 90.4 to 99.1%. Two distinct yellow mosaic viruses infecting french bean (MYMV and HYMV) were identified and it was observed that there exists considerable genetic variation among these species. Present work showed that the CP region is efficient enough to provide a simple, rapid and reliable method for early detection of MYMV infections in french bean, which would help to develop proper management strategies to control these viruses.
