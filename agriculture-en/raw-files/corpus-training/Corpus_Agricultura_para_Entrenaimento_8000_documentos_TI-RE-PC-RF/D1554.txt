#ITI#Variations in grain nitrogen removal associated with management practices in maize production#FTI#
#IRE#Information on N removal by maize (Zea mays L.) grain production is not only required for proper soil N management, but also a prerequisite for environmental risk assessment. The objectives of this field study were to (i) assess the variations of maize grain N removal in relation to weather and agronomic practices, and (ii) determine if a common N removal factor can be used for environment risk assessment with the Ontario N index method. Maize grain samples from four field experiments including treatments of hybrids, rotation systems and fertilizer N levels under different environmental conditions were used to determine nitrogen removal factor (grain N in kg ha-1 divided by grain yield in Mg ha-1, i.e. kg N Mg-1). In general, grain N removal averaged 12.0 kg N Mg-1, which is substantially smaller than 16 kg Mg-1 used in the Ontario N Index model. However, large variations (7.1-16.7 kg N Mg-1) in the N removal factor existed among years, rotation systems, hybrids and level of fertilizer N application. Our data indicate that an index using a constant grain N removal factor may not be representative of different growing conditions, hybrids and fertilizer levels. Hence, care must be taken when using a constant grain N removal factor with the N index approach to assess N overloading for nutrient management legislation purposes.
