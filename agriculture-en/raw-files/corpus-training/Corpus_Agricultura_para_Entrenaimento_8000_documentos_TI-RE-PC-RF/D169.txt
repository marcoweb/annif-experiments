#ITI#Short-term exposure to silver nano-particles alters the physiology and induces stress-related gene expression in Nelumbo nucifera#FTI#
#IRE#Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) was used as model plant in this study to explore its physiology and molecular response upon short-term exposure to silver nano-particles (AgNPs). Accumulation patterns demonstrated a potential uptake of AgNPs by roots and transport to the leaves as a likely key translocation route in lotus. AgNPs exposure was negatively correlated with lotus growth, including germination rate and petiole length in a concentration-dependent manner. Synthesis of chloroplast pigments in lotus leaves was enhanced by low AgNPs concentration, but were inhibited at high concentration. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was detected in lotus leaves after AgNPs treatment. Proline accumulation in lotus leaves was induced with the increase in AgNPs concentration and exposure time. Antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) as well as catalase (CAT) were enhanced after the first day of AgNPs exposure, but declined with increased exposure time, indicating a time-dependent toxicity of AgNPs. In addition, real-time PCR revealed that two detoxification-related genes, GSH1 and GST, could be activated on the first day of AgNPs exposure, but down-regulated with prolonged AgNPs treatment. Photosynthesis-related RbcS gene was up-regulated, however, no obvious difference in the expression of RbcL was observed after the first day of AgNPs exposure. Moreover, WRKY70a and WRKY70b transcription factors exhibited similar expression patterns, with the highest induction after a 5 mg/L AgNPs exposure on the first day, which decreased with prolonged exposure time. This study provides useful references for further evaluation of the toxic mechanism of AgNPs and their bio-effects on aquatic plants and ecosystems. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
