#ITI#Are partial nutrient balances suitable to evaluate nutrient sustainability of land use systems? Results from a case study in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia#FTI#
#IRE#Nutrient input-output balances are often used as indicators for the sustainability of land use systems. In a case study on plot scale in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, we measured nutrient input-output balances of natural rainforest and two unfertilized land use systems (maize, and coffee/cacao agroforestry). These are the two major land use systems on converted rainforest sites in this part of Sulawesi. We wanted to test if (a) plant nutrient balances are negative, (b) which pathway is most important for losses of plant nutrients, and (c) if partial plant nutrient balances are suitable to evaluate sustainability of the land use systems. We measured nutrient inputs by precipitation and nutrient outputs by harvest export and leaching. We selected two locations, the first was situated on a fertile Cambisol developed on alluvial sediment soil, and the second on a less fertile Cambisol developed on weathered phyllite substrate. Nutrient losses through leaching were higher on sites with higher soil fertility. Nutrient balances in natural forest on fertile soils were negative for N, Ca, K and Mg. Inputs of P by precipitation and outputs by leaching were below detection limit. On less fertile soils, leaching of N and K in natural forest was lower than inputs by precipitation. As net nutrient losses were highest in agroforestry, followed by maize and natural forest stands, forest conversion into agricultural land will result in increased nutrient losses. Main output pathway of N, P and K was harvest, whereas main output pathway for Ca and Mg was through leaching. The annual losses of nutrients we measured were higher than in comparable studies on nutrient poor soils; however losses were only small fractions of available nutrient stocks. Our results showed negative partial nutrient balances in both agricultural systems. Nutrient balances in this study were more influenced by native soil fertility than by land use. Because we found indirect evidence that some nutrient pathways, which were not measured, may have significantly changed the overall balance (biological N fixation, weathering), we conclude that partial nutrient balances are no good indicators for sustainability of land use systems. © Springer 2005.#FRE#
