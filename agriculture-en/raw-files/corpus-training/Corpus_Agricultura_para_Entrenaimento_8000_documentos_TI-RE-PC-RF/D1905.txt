#ITI#Long term effects of fertilization on carbon and nitrogen sequestration and aggregate associated carbon and nitrogen in the Indian sub-Himalayas#FTI#
#IRE#An understanding of the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) as affected by farming practices is imperative for maintaining soil productivity and also for restraining global warming by CO2 evolution. Results of a long-term (30 year) experiment in the Indian Himalayas under rainfed soybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation was analyzed to determine the influence of mineral fertilizer and farmyard manure (FYM) application at 10 Mg ha-1 on SOC and total soil nitrogen (TSN) stocks and distribution within different aggregate size fractions. Fertilizers (NP, NK and NPK) and FYM in combination with N or NPK were applied before the soybean crop every year and no nutrient was applied before the wheat crop. Results showed that addition of FYM with N or NPK fertilizers increased SOC and TSN contents. The overall gain in SOC in the 0- to 45-cm soil depth interval in the plots under NPK+FYM treatment over NPK was 17.18 Mg Cha-1 in 30 year. The rate of conversion of input C to SOC was about 19% of each additional Mg C input per hectare. SOC content in large size aggregates was greater than in smaller size aggregates, and declined with decreased aggregate size. Thus, long-term soybean-wheat rotation in a sandy loam soil of the Indian Himalayas sequestered carbon and nitrogen. Soil organic C and TSN sequestration in the 0.25- to 0.1-mm size fraction is an ideal indicator of long-term C and N sequestration, since this fraction retained maximum SOC/TSN stock.
