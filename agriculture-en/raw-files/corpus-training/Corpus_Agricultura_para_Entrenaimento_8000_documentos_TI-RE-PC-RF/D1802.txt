#ITI#Effect of management history and temperature on the mineralization of methylene urea in soil#FTI#
#IRE#A soil incubation and a greenhouse study on processing tomato were used to test the effects of soil temperature and the size and activity of the soil microbial biomass (SMB) on the degradation (mineralization) rate of a slow-release N fertilizer, methylene urea (MU), a condensation product of urea and formaldehyde. The mineralization rates of three MUs: Short (S), Medium (M), and Long (L) with different water solubilities were measured at two temperatures in a soil with low (fallow, F) and high (cover crop, CC) microbial activity. In the greenhouse study, the fate of fertilizer N was followed using 15N-urea and 15N-MU. The fertilizer N efficiency calculated for urea using the 15N mass balance approach was 93 and 85% compared with 65 and 67% for MU-S in F and CC soils, respectively. During six months of incubation, 52 and 63% of MU-S N was mineralized at 20 and 30°C, respectively. The accumulated N data suggested that the degradation of all three MU types followed first-order reaction kinetics. The reaction rates were similar for all three MUs and increased with increasing temperature. However, fitting discrete, non-accumulated data revealed that MU mineralization is more complex and cannot be modeled with simple exponential decay equations. The size and activity of SMB did not affect the mineralization rate of MU-N under laboratory or greenhouse conditions. Interestingly, Activity Index (AI), defined as the slowly available pool of MU-N, was not a reliable indicator for the mineralization rate and plant availability of MU-N.#FRE#
