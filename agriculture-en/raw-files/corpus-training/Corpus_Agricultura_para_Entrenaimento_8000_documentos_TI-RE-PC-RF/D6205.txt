#ITI#Maternal effects strengthen interactions of temperature and precipitation, determining seed germination of dominant alpine grass species#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Despite the existence of many studies on the responses of plant species to climate change, there is a knowledge gap on how specific climatic factors and their interactions regulate seed germination in alpine species. This understanding is complicated by the interplay between responses of seeds to the environment experienced during germination, the environment experienced by the maternal plant during seed development and genetic adaptations of the maternal plant to its environment of origin. Methods: The study species (Anthoxanthum alpinum, A. odoratum) originated from localities with factorial combinations of temperature and precipitation. Seed germination was tested in conditions simulating the extreme ends of the current field conditions and a climate change scenario. We compared the performance of field-collected seeds with that of garden-collected seeds. Results: A change to warmer and wetter conditions resulted in the highest germination of A. alpinum, while A. odoratum germinated the most in colder temperature and with home moisture. The maternal environment did have an impact on plant performance of the study species. Field-collected seeds of A. alpinum tolerated warmer conditions better than those from the experimental garden. Conclusions: The results demonstrate how knowledge of responses to climate change can increase our ability to understand and predict the fate of alpine species. Studies that aim to understand the germination requirements of seeds under future climates should use experimental designs allowing the separation of genetic differentiation, plasticity and maternal effects and their interactions, since all these mechanisms play an important role in driving species’ germination patterns. © 2021 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
