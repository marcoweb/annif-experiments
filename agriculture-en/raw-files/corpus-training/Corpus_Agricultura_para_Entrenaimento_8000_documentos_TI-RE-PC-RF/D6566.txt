#ITI#Fossil evidence for sporeling development of a Mesozoic osmundaceous fern#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: An anatomically preserved fossil fern sporeling has been discovered in a Lower Cretaceous marine concretion from Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, providing an opportunity to characterize rhizome growth from an extinct species. Methods: The specimen was studied from serial transverse sections prepared by the cellulose acetate peel technique. Results: The rhizome ranges from ~0.7 to 1.1 mm in diameter, has a sclerenchymatous pith, a stele that attains a dictyoxylic architecture, and sclerenchymatous outer cortex, features that are characteristic of osmundaceous rhizomes. Cauline xylem forms a medullated protostele or solenostele at some levels, but is dissected into discrete xylem bundles at others. Fronds diverge in a helical phyllotaxis, range up to 1.1 mm in greatest dimension, and have a C-shaped trace and outer cortex of sclerotic cells. Inside the sclerenchyma of the petioles are two lateral sclerotic strands and a sclerotic bundle adaxial to the trace. Together, these characters reveal the occurrence of a new species, Todea minutacaulis and provide evidence for developmental changes that occur in the rhizome as the sporeling increased in size. Conclusions: Small size of the specimen, medullated protostelic-dictyoxylic solenostelar vascular architecture, and incompletely sclerified cells apically reveal that osmundaceous sporeling development has remained constant since at least the Early Cretaceous. Together with Todea tidwellii and Osmunda vancouverensis that also are present in the Apple Bay flora, this sporeling documents the occurrence of a multispecies assemblage of osmundaceous ferns and demonstrates that the genus Todea was diversifying rapidly by the Early Cretaceous. © 2023 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
