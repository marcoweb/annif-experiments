#ITI#Influence of dates of sowing and irrigation scheduling on phenology, growth and yield dynamics of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum greacum l.)#FTI#
#IRE#An investigation was carried out at the Horticultural Research Station, BCKV, West Bengal for identifying the best date of sowing and irrigation in fenugreek. The sowing was done in five different dates ie. 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd November and 28th December using three irrigation levels. The results showed significant variation with different dates of sowing and irrigation on phenology, growth and yield of fenugreek. Sowing date had significant effects on seed yield and its components. Seed yield of fenugreek was also dependent on irrigation scheduling. Projected seed yield/hectare was maximum (1.37 and 1.4 t ha-1) on 2nd November (17.66 and 17.9 g) with irrigation in all major growth stages. It may be concluded that to obtain higher seed yield fenugreek should be sown earlier at 2nd November and irrigation should be given at seedling, branching, flowering, pod formation, pod development stages. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
