#ITI#Management of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) diseases through nutrient supplements#FTI#
#IRE#Crop responses to mineral nutrients may be conducive or adverse to diseases, depending on disease type, severity, crop species, and cultivars. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to measure the effect of nutrient doses on to peanut diseases. The treatments were quite effective to manage the peanut diseases in kharif (Kh) as well as in rabi-summer (RS). All the treatments, applied however significantly reduced the soil borne as well as foliar fungal disease in comparison to control (without any external supply of nutrients). In kharif severity of ELS, LLS and Rust was (6.9) (4.4) and (6.2), respectively while it was highest in control (T7) and the per cent disease incidence of soil borne disease viz. aflaroot, collar rot and stem rot observed (2.5, 3.9 and 13.2 respectively) in T1 while it was (4.5, 5.7 and 16.8 respectively) in control (T7). In rabi stem rot incidence (21.3%) was recorded in control while it was lowest (9.7%) in the treatment T3 (25:50:0 NPK + 500 kg gypsum ha-1 + 2.5 kg zinc ha-1). The pod and haulm yield was recorded for effectiveness of different treatment on yield and found that the treatment T1 (25:50:0 NPK + 500 kg Gypsum+ 2.5 kg zinc+ 1 kg Boron) significantly increased the yield up to 40.5%. In both season T1 (25:50:0 NPK + 500 kg Gypsum+ 2.5 kg zinc + 1 kg Boron) reduces the disease severity significantly. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
