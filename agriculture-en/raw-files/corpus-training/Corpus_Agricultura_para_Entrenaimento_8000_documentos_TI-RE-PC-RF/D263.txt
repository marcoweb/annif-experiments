#ITI#Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of floral fragrance-related compounds in scented rose (Rosa hybrida) varieties and a subsequent evaluation on the basis of the analytical hierarchy process#FTI#
#IRE#Scented rose (Rosa hybrida) varieties are valued as ornamentals, but they also contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that produce pleasant aromas. In plants, aromas are produced via metabolism during growth, and each aroma compound has a unique function. In this study, the floral aroma compounds of diverse scented rose varieties were analyzed and classified. The VOCs of different rose varieties were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed via headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The test materials were the mature flowers of 55 scented rose varieties that were cultivated under identical conditions. Seventeen important aroma compounds were selected and an analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based method was developed to identify the most suitable essential oil resources, aromatherapy resources, and healthcare resources. A floral fragrance evaluation model was established for the comprehensive evaluation of the scented rose varieties. The 55 varieties were classified into three grades according to their suitability for each use. ‘Soeur Emmanuelle’, ‘Wollerton Old Hall’, ‘Accademia’, and ‘Tianmidemeng’ were revealed to be suitable essential oil, aromatherapy, and healthcare resources. On the basis of their aroma compound types, the fifty-five rose varieties were divided into eight groups. The results of this study provide the theoretical basis for the classification of rose flower aromas as well as the rational use of diverse rose varieties to further develop the rose industry. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
