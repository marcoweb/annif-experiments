#ITI#Genetic study and selection indices for grain yield of mungbean#FTI#
#IRE#Mungbean (Vigna radiata L.) genotypes along with two parents were studied to assess the magnitude of genotypic variability, heritability and selection indices among the yield components and their direct and indirect effects on grain yield. On the basis of genetic variability, all the traits exhibited high heritability estimates coupled with high genetic advance as percent of mean (h2≥ 60%, GAM≥20 %) except 100 grain weight (h2 = 0.51, GAM= 8.0 %), indicating the preponderance of additive gene action. Biological yield/plant and harvest index had the most positive direct effects (1.448, 1.144, respectively) on grain yield/plant, indicating these traits synergistically affect photosyntates. Based on Smith-Hazel indices the highest genetic advance (17.56%) in grain yield/plant obtained on linear combination of traits such as days to 50% flowering, days to maturity, plant height, pod length, grains/pod and biological yield/plant (X2X3X4X7X8X10) accomplished through a completely new selection-index in which economic weight of each traits were equally distributed, suggesting that these parameters may be considered as prime traits during the course of selection to realize higher yield potential in green gram. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
