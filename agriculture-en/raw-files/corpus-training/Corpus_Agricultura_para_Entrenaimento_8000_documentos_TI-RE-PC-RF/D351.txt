#ITI#Effects of molybdenum supply on microbial diversity and mineral nutrient availability in the rhizosphere soil of broad bean (Vicia Faba L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Molybdenum application holds the potential to enhance agricultural productivity. However, the precise impact on soil microbial diversity and mineral nutrient availability remains uncertain. In this study, we collected rhizosphere soil samples from different growth stages of broad beans. By analyzing mineral element contents, soil phosphorus and zinc fractions, as well as fungal and bacterial diversity, we observed that Mo application resulted in a reduction of soil Citrate‒P and HCl‒P content. This reduction led to an increase in available P content at different stages. Moreover, Mo application elevated root P concentration, but concurrently impeded the translocation of P to the shoots. Mo application also decreased the soil Exc‒Zn (exchangeable Zn) content while increasing the Res‒Zn (residual Zn) content, ultimately causing a decrease in available Zn content at different stages. Consequently, the Zn concentration within broad beans correspondingly decreased. Mo application fostered an augmentation in fungal richness and Shannon indices at the branching and podding stages. The analysis of microbial co-occurrence networks indicated that Mo application bolstered positive connectivity among fungal taxa. Remarkably, Mo significantly increased the abundance of Chaetomium, Leucosporidium, and Thielavia fungi. Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between fungal diversity and soil available P content, as well as a notable negative correlation with soil available Zn content. These findings suggest that Mo application may modify the availability of soil P and Zn by influencing fungal diversity in the rhizosphere of crop soil, ultimately impacting nutrient accumulation within the grains. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
