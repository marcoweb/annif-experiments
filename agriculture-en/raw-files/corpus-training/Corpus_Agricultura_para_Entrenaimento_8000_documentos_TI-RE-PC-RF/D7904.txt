#ITI#A baseline regional evapotranspiration (ET) and change hotspots over Indian sub-tropics using satellite remote sensing data#FTI#
#IRE#The annual water loss through evapotranspiration (ET) is an uncertain but significant component of India's water budget. The present study generated independent estimates of baseline annual ET, calibrated with in situ micrometeorological data over Indian sub-continent, using surface energy balance framework and satellite-based long-term thermal remote sensing, visible and near-infrared observations as the primary data sources. Thirty years’ (1981–2010) of satellite-based ET estimates at 0.08° grid resolution were used to assess trend in regional ET, to find out change hot-spots and probable causes. Long-term collateral data, influencing ET, such as gridded (0.5° × 0.5°) annual rainfall (RF), annual mean surface soil moisture (SSM) at 25 km resolution from ESA scatterometers and annual mean incoming shortwave radiation from MERRA-2D reanalysis were also analyzed. Mean annual ET loss was found to be the highest for Indian cropland (890 Cubic Km) than forest (575 Cubic Km). Annual water consumption pattern over vegetation systems showed declining ET trend at the rate of -16 Cubic Km yr−1 upto 1995 during 30 years which might be due to declining rainfall and solar dimming. This was followed by increasing ET trend (34 Cubic Km yr−1). During 2001–2010, irrigated cropland showed a steep increase in water consumption pattern with an average rate of 4 Cubic Km yr−1 while grassland and forest showed declining consumption patterns since 2003 and 2007, respectively thus showing crossover points of their consumption patterns with irrigated cropland. Four agriculturally important Indian eastern, central, western and southern states showed significantly increasing ET trend with S-score of 15–25 and Z-score of 1.09–2.9 during this period. Increasing ET in western and southern states was found to be coupled with increase in annual rainfall and SSM. But in eastern and central states, no significant trend in rainfall was observed though significant increase in ET was noticed. Region-specific correlation of annual ET with natural forcing variables was higher for incoming shortwave radiation as compared to rainfall. The increase in ET over irrigated croplands as well as over some of the Indian states could be due to increase in anthropogenic factors which need more detailed investigations in future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
