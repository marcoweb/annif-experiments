#ITI#Time series change in pulse scenario in India with special reference to Haryana#FTI#
#IRE#Pulses are an important ingredient of the vegetarian diet of Indian masses. Pulses are a major source of protein predominantly among Indian vegetarian people making their diets more balanced and nutritive. In this study, analysis has been done to help out the researcher and policy makers to take decisions regarding future initiatives and programmes. In India during 2016-17 pulses were grown over an area of 29.27 million hectare producing 22.4 million tones with yield of 765 kg / per hectare. The cropping area of pulses in Haryana as compared to India is almost decreasing. The trend of contribution of pulses by Haryana at national level is also decreasing which reduces from 0.81 million tons in 1970-71 to 0.06 million tons in 2016-17. In India, about 5.63 to 10.90 percent share of food grains production is pulses. The percentage growth rate in the cropped area as well as in production of total pulses in India shows much fluctuation but serious downfall Haryana. The cropped area, production and productivity of total pulses in India shows positive trend from 10th Five Year Plan, however it is found reverse in Haryana. The highest per capita availability of pulses in a 1971-72 which was 51.22 grams per day and the lowest per capita availability of pulses in 2003-04 i.e. 10.6 grams per day in India.
