#ITI#Organic orchard floor management impact on soil quality indicators: nutrient fluxes, microbial biomass and activity#FTI#
#IRE#Maintaining nutrient availability in organic orchards presents challenges. Diverse litter sources may increase nutrient cycling and the efficiency by which microbes utilize carbon (C). Two tree-row treatments: ‘straw-mulch’ (Triticum aestivum L.) and ‘living-mulch’ (Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv.), and two alleyway groundcovers: ‘grass’ (Festuca rubra with Lolium perenne L.) and a legume, ‘Birdsfoot trefoil’ (Lotus corniculatus L.) were compared to an industry standard, tillage with a grass alleyway. Tree-row deposited trefoil biomass contributed 0.2 kg additional total nitrogen (N) per tree annually. Soil from tree-rows with trefoil alleyways had 23% greater organic C (+ 3.1 g kg−1), 17% greater total N (+ 0.3 g kg−1), up to 53% greater microbial biomass (+ 204 mg CO2–C kg−1), 32, 34 and 31% greater dehydrogenase (+ 2.3 µg TPF g−1), alkaline (+ 55.9 µg p-nitrophenol g−1) and acid (+ 106.7 µg p-nitrophenol g−1) phosphomonoesterase enzyme activity, 62% greater soil NO3 −N (+ 2.05 µg NO3 −1 g−1), and 51% higher nitrification rates (+ 0.22 µg NO2 −–N + NO3 −–N g−1 soil h−1) than tree-row soils adjacent to grass alleyways. Straw-mulch and living-mulch soils did not differ. Metabolic CO2 quotient (qCO2) values were lowest in trefoil (0.0032) and living-mulch with grass treatments (0.0036), indicating greater microbial growth efficiency. Tillage and straw-mulch with grass alleyway treatments had the highest qCO2 (0.0053 and 0.0048) and the lowest microbial biomass (246.3 and 297.6 mg CO2–C kg−1 soil). Higher potential biochemical activity, and total C and N, suggests orchards with trefoil alleyways cut and deposited into tree-rows, enhances soil organic matter and promotes balanced nutrient cycling and retentive processes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
