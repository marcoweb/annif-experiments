#ITI#Blackhead disease: Reduced sensitivity of histomonas meleagridis to nitarsone in Vitro and in Vivo#FTI#
#IRE#Histomonas meleagridis, a flagellated protozoan parasite, is the causative agent of blackhead disease or histomoniasis in gallinaceous birds. Currently nitarsone (4-nitrophenylarsonic acid) is the only approved preventative drug available in the United States against blackhead disease. Initially we tested the sensitivity of three different isolates of H. meleagridis collected from outbreaks in North Carolina (strain MNC), Michigan (strain ZM), and Georgia (strain BG) to nitarsone using in vitro culture conditions. Strain ZM and strain BG at 100 and 400 ppm showed reduced growth in comparison to their respective control groups. However, there was no inhibition of growth in strain MNC treated with nitarsone at 100 ppm, while reduced growth was seen at 400 ppm. To test the resistance of strain MNC to nitarsone in vivo, turkey poults fed a nitarsone or a control diet were inoculated cloacally with H. meleagridis. The nitarsone-treated group of birds did not show any significant difference compared to that of infected control group when measuring weight gain and liver and cecal lesions scores. Histomonas meleagridis were reisolated from the nitarsone-fed turkeys and subjected to the in vitro assay. Regenerated H. meleagridis maintain their resistance to nitarsone at 100 ppm. This study demonstrates that strain MNC has acquired partial resistance to nitarsone. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
