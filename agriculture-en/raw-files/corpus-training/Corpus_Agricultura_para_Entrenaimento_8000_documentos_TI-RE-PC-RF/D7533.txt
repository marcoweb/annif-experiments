#ITI#Minimisation or remediation: A cost benefit comparison of two approaches for managing irrigation-induced deep percolation#FTI#
#IRE#We compare the net present costs of two approaches for managing irrigation-induced deep percolation under border-check irrigated pasture: (1) conversion from border-check irrigation to sprinkler irrigation to minimise deep percolation and (2) installation of a subsurface drainage system to extract excess deep percolation under the existing border-check system. Results for a dairy farm in northern Victoria, Australia, show that conversion to sprinkler irrigation is the more cost-effective approach. The net present cost of the second approach varies across an irrigation landscape, depending on the most suitable subsurface drainage and disposal system that can be used for a particular location. Where an aquifer is high yielding and of low salinity and thus drainage water is suitable for reuse on farm, tubewell drainage and farm reuse of drainage water provides a viable alternative to conversion from border-check irrigation to sprinkler irrigation. Where tubewell drainage or farm reuse is not feasible, sprinkler irrigation is more cost-effective than border-check irrigation with subsurface drainage. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.
