#ITI#The Effect of Rhizobacteria in the Reducing drought Stress in Soybean (Glycine max L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: This study was carried out to determine the effects of rhizobacteria and blue green algae applications on some physiological properties of soybean (Glycina max L.) grown under water stress. Methods: The experiment was conducted in factorial order with 4 replications according to the randomized plot trial design. In the research, Arısoy variety belonging to soybean (Glycine max L.) species was used. In the experiment, it was aimed to examine the effects of three different irrigation levels (100, 50 and 25%) on some physiological characteristics of soybean with a control (control (B0), two different bacteria used. In this study, strains R1 of Azospirillum lipoferum bacteria, strains numbered 98 belonging to Bacillus megaterium bacteriaein and one blue green algae (Chlorella saccharophilia) were used. Result: According to the average data obtained, root length is 24.75 cm-30.85 cm, seedling length 28.10-36.57 cm, root fresh weight 1.10-1.43 g, seedling wet weight 1.55-2.41 g, root dry weight 0.15-0.18 g, seedling dry weight 0.38-0.46 g, azote balance index 70.64-82.90 (dualex value), flavonol 0.375-0.398 (dualex value) and anthocyanin 0.016-0.045 (dualex value), with water restriction showed a decrease in most of these values. It has been determined that the rhizobacteria and blue-green algae have a decreasing and regulating effect on the physiological properties examined. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
