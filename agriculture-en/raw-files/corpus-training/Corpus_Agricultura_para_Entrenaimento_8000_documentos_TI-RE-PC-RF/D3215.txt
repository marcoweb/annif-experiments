#ITI#Effects of Moringa olifera leaf extracts on growth and productivity of three leguminous crops#FTI#
#IRE#Different concentrations of Moringa leaf extract were used to evaluate their effects on three leguminous crops (Alfalfa and Clitoria as forage crops and Mung bean as grain legume) Three independent experiments were carried out at King Abdulaziz University Experimental Station in Makkah province during 2015 and 2016. Treatments consisted of four concentrations of Moringa leaf extract (C1=1ml of juice+10 ml of distilled water, C2=1ml of juice+20ml of distilled water, C3=1ml of juice+30 ml of distilled water and C4=1ml of juice+40 ml of distilled water) and only distilled water as control. Results showed that the higher concentration C1 contained the highest concentrations of inorganic elements and growth hormones compared to the other concentrations. Thisæ in turnæ was reflected in significantly higher growth and forage yields of both alfalfa and clitoria and significantly higher growth and grain yield of mung bean. The highest concentration C1 increased number of pods, pod dry weight, seed dry weight, and shelling out turn of mung bean compared to the control in year 2015 by 85, 60, 47 and 92%, respectively. Corresponding increments in 2016 for the same characters were 40, 47, 27 and 94%, respectively. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
