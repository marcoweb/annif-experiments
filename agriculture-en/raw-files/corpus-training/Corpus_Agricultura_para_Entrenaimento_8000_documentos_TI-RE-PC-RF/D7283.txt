#ITI#Evaluating the effects of irrigation water salinity on water movement, crop yield and water use efficiency by means of a coupled hydrologic/crop growth model#FTI#
#IRE#Numerical simulation is an efficient approach for investigating the salt and water movement through soil profile and predicting of crop response to soil water deficit and salinity. In this study a coupled model that describes the soil water and solute transport by means of HYDRUS-1D model and crop growth process by means of growth module of EPIC was used. The model was calibrated and validated against field data, collected during two growing seasons in field plots of winter wheat irrigated with four levels of irrigation amount and water salinity of 5 ds m−1 at the Fengqiu State Key Agro-Ecological Experimental Station, in North China Plain. The model was also used to evaluate the salinity stress on evapotranspiration (ET), grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) and long-term use of saline water on grain yield and salt accumulation. Visual inspection and the obtained statistical parameters values showed that good agreement between measured and simulated data of soil water content, salt concentration, ET and grain yield. Evapotranspiration values of winter wheat were reduced under salinity stress conditions, mainly by reducing crop transpiration. The grain yields were reduced due to salinity stress, but the change trend of WUE was associated with precipitation amount. Increasing per saline water irrigation amount is an effective way to reduce the WUE decline rate under the low rainfall growing season as like that in simulation year. The average of ten years grain yield confirmed that a yield potential exceeding 86% could be maintained by saline water with 5 ds m−1 when per irrigation volume more than 0.8 E, E denotes evaporation from an uncovered, 20 cm diameter pan positioned 0–5 cm above the crop canopy. There has a slight salt build-up after ten years simulation, and the quantity of salt accumulation decreased with the increase of irrigation volume. Thus, more attention should be paid to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture with low irrigation volume when using saline water irrigation. On the whole, field observations combined with the coupled model could be used to evaluate different agricultural managements on grain yield and soil salinity. © 2017#FRE#
