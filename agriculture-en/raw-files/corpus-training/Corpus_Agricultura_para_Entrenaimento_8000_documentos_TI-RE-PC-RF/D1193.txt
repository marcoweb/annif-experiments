#ITI#Long-term changes in phosphorus fractions in growers' paddocks in the northern Victorian grain belt#FTI#
#IRE#Increases in P fertiliser use in Australian grain production systems over the past decades have not necessarily coincided with improved nutrient-use efficiency by crops because only a small proportion of applied P has been directly used by crops, leaving large amounts of the P in soil. Information on the transformation of applied P and the residual effectiveness of P fertiliser in growers' paddocks under their crop rotations in a wide range of soil types may help to develop improved management practises for P fertilisers. The present study examined the size and changes of P pools in soils in the major regions used for grain production across northern Victoria. Soil samples were collected from 43 sites representing all the major soil types. In addition, samples were collected from adjacent 'reference' areas across fence-lines where remnant native vegetation was present to examine long-term changes in soil fertility as a result of cropping. Highly positive P balance in 27 growers' paddocks indicates potentially high rates of P fertilization in excess of that exported/lost from these paddocks. The accumulated P was transformed into both labile and non-labile pools depending on the general chemical-physical properties of a particular soil. In particular, in soils with a sandy texture and low oxalate-extractable Al and Fe such as the sandy Calcarosols, the residual P fertilizer was preferentially transformed into labile and moderately labile pools. These P fractions can be available for subsequent crops. In contrast, a large proportion of P fertilizer applied to other soil types has been transformed into the non-labile P pools where crops have difficulty in accessing. It is suggested that P application rates should be reduced to avoid the loss of P through sorption/precipitation, leaching or run-off while still meet crop demand.
