#ITI#Combining Ability and Heterosis Studies in Blackgram [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper]#FTI#
#IRE#Pant U-31 recorded significant standard heterosis, heterobeltiosis and average heterosis for most of the important characters.´ Uttara were found promising combinations for seed yield per plant. Hybrid, KUP 18-350 ´ T-9 and KUP 18-345 ´ Pant U-31, KUP 18-345 ´ tester method. Result: In the present investigation the predominance of non-additive gene effect in the expression of plant height, no. of clusters per plant, no. of pods per cluster, no. of pods per plant, seed yield per plant, biological yield per plant, 100 seed weight and harvest index was found. Among parents, KUP 18-346 and KUP 18-350, Pant U-31 were found to be good general combiner for seed yield and some other characters. Hybrids viz., KUP 18-350 ´ tester mating fashion during the summer season of 2019 for obtaining 15 (Fifteen) crosses. Fifteen hybrids and their parents (3 lines and 5 testers), including one check, were grown and eleven traits were recorded to estimate general and specific combining ability in the modified line ´Background: Blackgram is one of the important pulse crops. To improve the yield levels in this crop, studies on combining ability and heterosis are a method to select suitable parents based on their general and specific combing ability and heterotic effects for use in further breeding programmes. Methods: The present investigation was conducted during Kharif 2019. The crosses were made in line. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
