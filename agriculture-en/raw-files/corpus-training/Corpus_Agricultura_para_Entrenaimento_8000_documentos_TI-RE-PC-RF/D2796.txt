#ITI#Screening of greengram genotypes for resistance against gram pod borer, helicoverpa armigera (hubner)#FTI#
#IRE#Among the ten genotypes/cultivars of greengram screened for their reactions to gram pod borer, H. armigera, GM-2K-5, GM-9926 and GM-2K-3 harboring 1.48, 2.20 and 2.30 larvae per plant, respectively were found comparatively less susceptible than genotypes GM-02-13 and GM-04-04, the highly susceptible ones with 4.65 and 4.09 larvae per plant, respectively. The remaining genotypes/cultivars viz., GM-9925, GM-9924, GM-05-08, GM-4 and GM-05-05 harburing 2.47, 3.08, 3.17, 3.23 and 3.31 larvae per plant, respectively registered moderately susceptible reactions.#FRE#
