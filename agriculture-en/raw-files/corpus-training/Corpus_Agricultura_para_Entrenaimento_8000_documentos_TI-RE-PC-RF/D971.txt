#ITI#Transcriptional and physiological analyses uncover the mineralization and uptake mechanisms of phytic acid in symbiotically grown Vicia faba plants#FTI#
#IRE#Legume-rhizobia symbiosis requires high phosphorus (P) in the form of ATP to convert atmospheric nitrogen (N) into ammonia. The fixed ammonia is converted to NH4+ by H+-ATPase via protonation. To the best of our knowledge, most of these research works resort to using only inorganic P (Pi) to the neglect of the organic P (Po) counterpart. As it stands, the potential regulating roles of plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPases during legume-rhizobia symbiosis in response to phytic acid supply and how it alters and modulates the regulation of PM H+-ATPases remain obscure. To contribute to the above hypothesis, we investigate the mechanisms that coordinately facilitate the growth, uptake, and transcript expression of PM H+-ATPase gene isoforms in response to different P sources when hydroponically grown Vicia faba plants were exposed to three P treatments, viz., low- and high-Pi (2.0 and 200 μM KH2PO4; LPi and HPi), and phytic acid (200 μM; Po) and inoculated with Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae 384 for 30 days. The results consistently reveal that the supply of Po improved not only the growth and biomass, but also enhanced photosynthetic parameters, P uptake and phosphatase activities in symbiotically grown Vicia faba relative to Pi. The supply of Po induced higher transcriptional expression of all PM H+-ATPase gene isoforms, with possible interactions between phosphatases and H+-ATPase genes in Vicia faba plants when exclusively reliant on N derived from nodule symbiosis. Overall, preliminary results suggest that Po could be used as an alternative nutrition in symbiotic crops to improve plant growth. © 2024 The Authors#FRE#
