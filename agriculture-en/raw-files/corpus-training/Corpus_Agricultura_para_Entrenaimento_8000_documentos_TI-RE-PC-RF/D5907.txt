#ITI#Coordination and plasticity in leaf anatomical traits of invasive and native vine species#FTI#
#IRE#• Premise of the study: Plant invasiveness can be promoted by higher values of adaptive traits (e.g., photosynthetic capacity, biomass accumulation), greater plasticity and coordination of these traits, and by higher and positive relative influence of these functionalities on fitness, such as increasing reproductive output. However, the data set for this premise rarely includes linkages between epidermal–stomatal traits, leaf internal anatomy, and physiological performance.#FRE#
