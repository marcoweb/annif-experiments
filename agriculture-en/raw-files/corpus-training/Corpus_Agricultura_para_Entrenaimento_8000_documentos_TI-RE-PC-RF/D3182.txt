#ITI#Management of Root Rot of Fenugreek Caused by Rhizoctonia solani using Plant Extracts and Bio-agents#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Root rot of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) caused by Rhizoctonia solani is an important constraint to the crop and causes significant economic losses in Rajasthan as well as India and fungicides are the major tool to overcome the disease incidence. As per environment and health issues and demand of organically produced fenugreek green leaves and seeds, it is a major concerned to control it by eco-friendly approaches. The current study aimed to find the most effective control measure of this dreaded disease through eco-friendly approaches. Methods: The present field-laboratory investigations were conducted during 2016-17 and 2017-18, to evaluate six plant extracts in vitro and in vivo, namely neem (Azadirachta indica), Alstonia (Alstonia scholaris), garlic (Allium sativum), datura (Datura stramonium), tulsi (Ocimum tenuiflorum), aak (Calotropis gigantea) and four bio-agents (Trichoderma harzianum, T. viride, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas fluorescens) in vivo through seed treatment alone and/or in combination for two consecutive years. Result: Our investigations in vitro with botanicals cleared that garlic clove extract was highly antimycotic to the pathogen (79.52%) followed by aak (62.48%) and neem extract (53.37%). Under field conditions, seed soaking with garlic clove extract (@10%) for 30 minutes was observed the most effective in reducing disease incidence (62.02%) and in increasing seed yield (65.35%) followed by aak (56.56% and 59.82%, respectively). In bio-agents, Trichoderma harzianum + Pseudomonas fluorescens (@ 3+3 g/kg seeds) was found superior in reducing disease incidence (66.81%) and in increasing seed yield (73.06%) and the next best was T. viride + P. fluorescens. The findings of this study can be utilized to manage the disease effectively and eco-friendly and also to obtain organic produce of the fenugreek. Â© 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
