#ITI#Performance of improved groundnut variety GPBD-4 in farmers field at Shimoga District of Karnataka#FTI#
#IRE#Front line demonstrations on Groundnut variety GPBD-4 was conducted for five years during rabi seasons (2005-06 to 2009- 2010) in farmers field in five different villages of three taluks (Soraba, Shikaripura and Shimoga) in Shimoga district of Karnataka state. It was observed that average pod yield performance of 60 demonstrations in an area of 24 ha ranged from 23.55 to 28.94 q/ha. There was 20.90 per cent increase in pod yield in demonstrated Groundnut variety over local check during all the five years of demonstration. In terms of economics also demonstrated Groundnut variety GPBD-4 was found economically superior with higher B:C ratio of 1:3.00 as against the lower B:C ratio of 1:2.41 in local check variety TMV-2.#FRE#
