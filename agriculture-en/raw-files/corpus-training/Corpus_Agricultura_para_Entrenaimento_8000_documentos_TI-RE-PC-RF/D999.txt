#ITI#SlWRKY37 targets SlLEA2 and SlABI5-like7 to regulate seed germination vigor in tomato#FTI#
#IRE#Seed germination is a critical phase for the life cycle and propagation of higher plants. This study explores the role of SlWRKY37, a WRKY transcription factor in tomato, in modulating seed germination. We discovered that SlWRKY37 expression is markedly downregulated during tomato seed germination. Through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing, we demonstrate that SlWRKY37 knockout enhances germination, while its overexpression results in a delay compared to the wild type. Transcriptome analysis revealed 679 up-regulated and 627 down-regulated genes in Slwrky37-CRISPR deletion mutants relative to the wild type. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated these differentially expressed genes are linked to seed dormancy, abscisic acid homeostasis, and protein phosphorylation pathways. Bioinformatics and biochemical assays identified SlABI5-like7 and SlLEA2 as key transcriptional targets of SlWRKY37, integral to tomato seed dormancy regulation. Additionally, SlWRKY37 was found to be post-translationally phosphorylated at Ser65, a modification crucial for its transcriptional activation. Our findings elucidate the regulatory role of SlWRKY37 in seed dormancy, suggesting its potential as a target for gene editing to reduce seed dormancy in tomato breeding programs.
