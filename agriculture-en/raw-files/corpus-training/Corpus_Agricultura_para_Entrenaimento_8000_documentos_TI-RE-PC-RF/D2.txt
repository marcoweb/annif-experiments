#ITI#Night warming at the vegetative stage improves pre-anthesis photosynthesis and plant productivity involved in grain yield of winter wheat#FTI#
#IRE#We conducted pot experiments during the 2018–2020 growing seasons to study the effects of night warming at different growth stages of wheat on the photosynthetic performance; accumulation, transportation, and distribution of dry matter; and grain yield of winter wheat. Night warming at all the different growth stages resulted in an elevation of wheat yield by increasing the 1000-grain weight and the number of grains per ear. Night warming during the period from jointing to booting stage resulted in the greatest increase in wheat yield. It also increased the amount of overall dry matter and transferrable amount of dry matter in plants and increased the distribution of dry matter to grains to increase grain weight. Night warming treatments at three different growth stages enhanced pre-anthesis photosynthetic capacity by increasing flag leaf net photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content, and photochemical efficiency of winter wheat at the early stage of grain filling, especially in the night warming treatment from jointing to booting stage. Night warming not only increased the stomatal density and stomatal index of wheat leaves but also increased stomatal conductance and transpiration rate in the early stage of grain filling, thus being conducive to the smooth progress of photosynthesis. In conclusion, night warming treatment at different growth stages increased the photosynthesis of flag leaves at the early stage of grain filling, and promoted the accumulation of dry matter in plants after anthesis, which was conducive to the grain yield of winter wheat. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
