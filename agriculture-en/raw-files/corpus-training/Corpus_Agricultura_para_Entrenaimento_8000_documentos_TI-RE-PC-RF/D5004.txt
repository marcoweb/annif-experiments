#ITI#Separating Mycoplasma gallisepticum field strains from nonpathogenic avian mycoplasmas#FTI#
#IRE#Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG) has repeatedly emerged as a serious problem in U.S. broiler, layer, and turkey industries. Tracing the source of an outbreak is essential if MG control is to be accomplished. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) are valuable tools used to study MG epidemiology, allowing diagnosticians to determine the source of MG infections. In some past outbreaks, AFLP, RAPD, and RFLP fingerprinting, which require pure MG cultures, were not successful because of contaminating nonpathogenic mycoplasmas from field samples. The objective of this research was to develop a method to separate rapidly growing nonpathogenic avian mycoplasma species from slower-growing MG field strains. Mixtures of MG and three separate nonpathogenic avian mycoplasmas were inoculated onto chick embryo fibroblasts cells (CEF) allowing MG to penetrate the CEF cells. Later, gentamicin sulphate was added to the culture, eliminating the nonpathogenic mycoplasmas and allowing MG to be isolated in pure culture. Mixtures of Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) and MG could not be separated in this assay. However, removal of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and cysteine hydrochloride during serial passage in Frey broth medium successfully eliminated growth of MS.#FRE#
