#ITI#Evaluation of Soybean (Glycine max L.) Genotypes on the Basis of Biochemical Contents and Anti-oxidant Enzyme Activities#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Soybean is an important leguminous crop. Abnormal weather has played an enormous role in the strident decline in crop yields. Drought is considered as a significant abiotic factor responsible for yield reduction in soybean. Methods: The present work was carried out in order to screen soybean genotypes for their drought tolerance ability by means of different biochemical and antioxidant enzymatic activities responses. Conclusion: On the basis of biochemical parameters and anti-oxidant enzymatic activities, soybean genotype viz., RVS-211-77, RVS-211-75, NRC-7, SL-96, NRC-136, AMS100-39, SL-96, RVS-2012-01, RVS-211-73 and JS97-52 have been identified with better performance and can be used as parents for further crop improvement programme to breed drought tolerant variety.
