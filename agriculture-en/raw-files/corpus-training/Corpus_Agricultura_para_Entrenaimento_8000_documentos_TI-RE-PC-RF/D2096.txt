#ITI#Pruning management effects on soil carbon and nitrogen in contour-hedgerow cropping with Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit on sloping land in Haiti#FTI#
#IRE#Application of hedgerow prunings to the soil in alley cropping is practiced to sustain crop yield but information is lacking on effects of hedgerow management on soil C and N dynamics under continuous cropping. Cumulative effects of 3.5 years of leucaena [Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) De Wit] hedgerow management on soil organic C and N and potential C and N mineralization were determined in an alley cropping experiment in Haiti. Treatments were combinations of pruning uses and pruning regimes in a 3 × 3 factorial with a no-tree control (rock walls) in a randomized complete block design with 3 replicates. A hedgerow + fertilizer treatment in an adjacent trial was included for comparison. Soil samples collected at 0-5, 5-10 and 10-20 cm depths were sealed in mason jars and incubated at 25°C for 30 days. Organic C and N and inorganic N were measured before the incubation. Inorganic N and respired CO2-C were measured after the incubation. After 3.5 years, surface soil samples with prunings applied as mulch or incorporated at planting had, respectively, 20 and 16% higher organic C, 34 and 18% higher organic N concentrations, higher potential C and N mineralization and higher relative N mineralization than with prunings removed. Soil C and N dynamics were similar between pruning application methods. The two-cut regime with a longer regrowth period after cutting (0-40 DAP) had highest organic C in the 0-20 cm soil layer whereas two-cut with a shorter regrowth period (0-30 DAP) had highest C turnover. Within soil layers, pruning application had higher organic C and N and potential C and N mineralization than the no-tree control and alley plots with prunings removed in the 0-5 cm layer whereas the latter treatments had similar C and N dynamics at all depths. Addition of N-P-K fertilizer in presence of fresh prunings did not increase soil organic C and N but enhanced N dynamics in the surface soil.#FRE#
