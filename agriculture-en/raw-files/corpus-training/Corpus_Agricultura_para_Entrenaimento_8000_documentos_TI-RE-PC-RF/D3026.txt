#ITI#Organic seaweed nano powder effect on growth and yield attributes of pigeonpea#FTI#
#IRE#In the field experiment Sargassum myricocystum extract at 1% concentration for 3 h soaking with foliar spray 5% at vegetative and flowering stages were effective by recording higher plant height, total chlorophyll content, leaf area index, crop growth rate, relative growth rate and yield attributes, such as pod yield plant-1and seed yield ha-1in both kharif, 2014 and rabi, 2015 seasons. The per cent increase of pod yield plant-1and seed yield ha-1was 13.4 and 18.3%, respectively. The other seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Caulerpa racemosa were less effective, but the effect was better than water. Â© 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
