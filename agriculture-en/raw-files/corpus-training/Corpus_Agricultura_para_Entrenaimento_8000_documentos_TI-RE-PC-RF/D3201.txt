#ITI#Prediction of dry matter accumulation in bitter vetch#FTI#
#IRE#This study was carried out in Bingol province on eastern Anatolian Region between 2013 and 2015. In this study, we obtained 14 bitter vetch genotypes from different sources. The experiment was carried our in three replications in randomized block design. Each plant was weekly measured for 6 weeks starting from germination. For each plant, plant height, fresh and dry stem weight, fresh and dry leaf weights were determined. Logistic, Richards and Weibull growth models were fitted to describe the growth pattern of the genotypes. The best fitting model criteria used were coefficient of determination and mean squared. Richards’s growth model was found to best fit the data for most of the genotypes. Logistic model was the worst fit. In Turkey, climate and soil properties have very large variations. For this, local genotypes showed large variation according to plating areas. YEREL LICE genotype showed more stable and it is the height identified all growth models than other local genotypes. However, IFVE 2923 SEL and IFVE 2977 SEL 2802 these genotypes gave positive results in different environmental conditions. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
