#ITI#Irrigation scheduling for traditional, low-density olive orchards: Water relations and influence on oil characteristics#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was performed in a low-density olive orchard (69 trees ha-1) to study the recovery from water stress of olive trees under different irrigation managements. The effect of water stress on oil quality was also examined. The trees were subjected to one of four irrigation treatments: rain-fed conditions, irrigation with either 100% or 125% of the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) level, or a deficit treatment in which only 60 mm of water were provided (at different times depending on the weather and phenological stage of the crop). The irrigation water in the deficit treatment was some 43% of the water applied in the 125% treatment. Plant water relations were determined periodically by measuring the water potential of covered leaves and the stomatal conductance at midday. The trees in the water deficit and rain-fed treatments rapidly recovered from water stress after receiving irrigation water or autumn rainwater, respectively, reaching the condition of the fully irrigated trees. However, stomatal conductance took longer to recover. Recovery at mid-summer in the deficit treatment was related to the amount of water in the soil; in autumn, however, this relationship was not so clear in rain-fed trees. The effect on oil quality was recorded in terms of the total concentration of phenolic compounds (TP). This was strongly related to the water stress integral, suggesting that the effect of irrigation on this variable occurs year-round and not just during the oil accumulation phase. Thus, even with low doses of water it should be possible to significantly reduce the TP concentration. Since recovery from water stress is rapid when irrigation is concentrated in the second half of summer, such an irrigation regimen might allow efficient use of the limited amounts of water available in central Spain. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.
