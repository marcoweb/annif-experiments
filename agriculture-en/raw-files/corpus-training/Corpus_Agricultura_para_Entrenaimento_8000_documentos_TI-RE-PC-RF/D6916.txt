#ITI#Matric potential-based irrigation management of field-grown strawberry: Effects on yield and water use efficiency#FTI#
#IRE#Effective and adapted criteria for irrigation scheduling are required to improve yield and water use efficiency (WUE) and reduce the environmental impacts associated with water and nutrients losses by runoff and leaching. In this study, field-scale experiments were conducted at four commercial strawberry production sites with contrasting soil and climatic conditions. Within each site, the influence of different soil matric potential-based irrigation thresholds (IT) on yield and WUE was evaluated. Matric potential-based irrigation management was also compared with common irrigation practices used by producers in each site's respective areas. At Site 1 (silty clay loam; humid continental (Dfb) climate), an IT of -15. kPa improved yields by 6.2% without any additional use of water relative to common irrigation practices. At Site 2, with similar soil and climatic conditions, the irrigation treatments did not affect yield and the matric potential-based management decreased WUE relative to common practices. However, the results suggested that maintaining the soil matric potential lower than -9. kPa could induce stressing conditions for the plants. At Site 3 (sandy loam; Mediterranean (Cs) climate), the best yield and WUE were obtained with an IT of -8. kPa and suggested that WUE could be further improved by implementing high-frequency irrigation. At Site 4 (clay loam; Mediterranean (Cs) climate), results suggested that an IT between -10 and -15. kPa could optimize yield and WUE, and matric potential-based irrigation considerably reduced leaching under the root zone relative to common practices. Considering the results from all sites, an IT of -10. kPa appears to be adequate as a starting point for further optimizing irrigation under most field conditions. © 2015 The Authors.#FRE#
