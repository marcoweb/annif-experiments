#ITI#Crop yield after 5 decades of contrasting residue management#FTI#
#IRE#The benefits of soil organic input on crop yields have long been discussed, yet details of their relationship remain controversial. This study considers the effects of different residue management on crop performance as assessed by yield and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Three residue management (residue removal, residue incorporation, and residue incorporation + added poultry manure), combined with five levels of N application, were studied in a long-term experiment starting in 1966. Crop residue incorporation improved maize yield by 12% (nutritional effect) and sugar beet yield by 16% (non-nutritional), and the combination of crop residue incorporation with added poultry manure increased both winter wheat and sugar beet yields by 8% (nutritional effect). The NUE values of mineral fertiliser were almost three-fold those of residues and the combination of residue with poultry manure, except in sugar beet and maize, where NUE of mineral fertilizer approached those observed for residues (0.44 vs 0.45, on average). In wheat, NUE for residue incorporation with added poultry manure was nearly double the NUE for residues alone. Residue management effects depended on crop type; spring-sown crops showing stronger effects than those sown in autumn. Residues primarily produced a nutritional effect, suggesting that they decomposed within 1 year. While residue use offers little potential for soil improvement, it does reduce the need for fertilisers. © 2020, The Author(s).#FRE#
