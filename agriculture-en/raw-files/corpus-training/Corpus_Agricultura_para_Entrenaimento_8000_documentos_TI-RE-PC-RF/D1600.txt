#ITI#Using the DSSAT-CERES-Maize model to simulate crop yield and nitrogen cycling in fields under long-term continuous maize production#FTI#
#IRE#Simulation models, such as the DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) Crop System Models are often used to characterize, develop and assess field crop production practices. In this study, one of the DSSAT Cropping System Model, CERES-Maize, was employed to characterize maize (Zea mays) yield and nitrogen dynamics in a 50-year maize production study at Woodslee, Ontario, Canada (42°13′N, 82°44′W). The treatments selected for this study included continuous corn/maize with fertilization (CC-F) and continuous corn/maize without fertilization (CC-NF) treatments. Sequential model simulations of long-term maize yield (1959-2008), near-surface (0-30 cm) soil mineral nitrogen (N) content (2000), and soil nitrate loss (1998-2000) were compared to measured values. The model did not provide accurate predictions of annual maize yields, but the overall agreement was as good as other researchers have obtained. In the CC-F treatment, near-surface soil mineral N and cumulative soil nitrate loss were simulated by the model reasonably well, with n-RMSE = 62 and 29%, respectively. In the CC-NF treatment, however, the model consistently overestimated soil nitrate loss. These outcomes can be used to improve our understanding of the long-term effects of fertilizer management practices on maize yield and soil properties in improved and degraded soils. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
