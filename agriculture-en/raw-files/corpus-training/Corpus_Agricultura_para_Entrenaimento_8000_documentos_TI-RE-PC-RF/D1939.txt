#ITI#Double-cropping annual ryegrass and bermudagrass to reduce phosphorus levels in soil with history of poultry litter application#FTI#
#IRE#Long-term application of poultry litter may result in excessively high soil phosphorus (P). This field study determined the potential of 'Coastal' bermudagrass overseeded with 'Marshall' annual ryegrass and harvested for hay to reduce the level of Mehlich-3 extractable P (M3-P) that had accumulated in a Savannah soil due to a 30-year history of broiler litter application to bermudagrass, as well as antecedent litter rates of 0, 4.48, 8.96, 17.9, and 35.8 Mg ha-1 in 1999-2001. Following the cessation of litter, the plots were overseeded in fall 2001-2003 and fertilized in summer with 268 kg N ha-1 as NH4NO3. Applying 8.96 Mg ha -1 litter significantly elevated M3-P in surface soil (0-15 cm depth) from about 183 to 263 mg kg-1. Annual dry matter (DM) yield and P uptake generally increased as litter rate increased up to 17.9 Mg ha -1. Analysis of M3-P at four sampling dates from October 2002 to April 2004 found no significant effect of forage system or its interaction with litter rate, and levels in both systems decreased by about 25, 27, 22, 26, and 29% at the five litter rates, respectively. Ryegrass-bermudagrass significantly increased DM yield and P uptake, but did not translate to reductions in M3-P, as compared to bermudagrass winter fallow. With no further litter additions and five harvests per year, both forage systems removed about 49 kg ha-1 P with a DM yield of 15 Mg ha-1 and reduced M3-P by about 26 mg kg-1 annually. Bermudagrass performance is important in the remediation of high soil P. Â© 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
