#ITI#Genetic analysis for yield and yield attributes in greengram (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek)#FTI#
#IRE#Six basic generations viz., P1, P2, F1, F2, B1 and B2 of five selected crosses viz., LGG-460 × WGG-37, TM-96-2 × WGG-37, TM-96-2 × PM-112, MGG-295 × PM-110 and MGG-351 × PM-115 were studied to assess the nature and mode of gene action for yield and its component traits through generation mean analysis. In general, magnitude of dominance effects (h) has greater value than additive effects (d) for majority of the traits in all the crosses. All the traits are under the influence of duplicate epistasis besides additive type of gene effects for which bi-parental mating or inter-se mating may be adopted followed by pedigree method of selection to modify the genetic architecture of greengram for attaining higher yields with desirable properties. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
