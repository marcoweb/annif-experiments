#ITI#Structure-activity relationship study for fungicidal activity of 1-(4-phenoxymethyl-2-phenyl-[1,3]dioxolan-2-ylmethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole derivatives against rice blast#FTI#
#IRE#To explore new antifungal agents for rice blast control, the antifungal activity of a series of novel 1,2,4-triazole derivatives against Magnaporthe oryzae has been evaluated. The antifungal activity was determined by using in vitro mycelial growth inhibition tests. Among the 19 test compounds, we found that the compound 1-(4-phenoxymethyl-2-phenyl-[1,3]dioxolan-2-ylmethyl)-1H-1,2,4- triazole (Gj) displayed potent antifungal activity against M. oryzae. The IC50 value was found approximately 3.8±0.5 μM and the IC50 value of propiconazole was found to be approximately 3.7±0.2 μM, respectively. Structure-activity relationship studies on aromatic ring structures provided insight and information about the structural requirements for antifungal activity of this synthetic series against M. oryzae. © by Keimei Oh 2015.#FRE#
