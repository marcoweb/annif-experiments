#ITI#Spores potentially dispersed to longer distances are more tolerant to ultraviolet radiation: A case study in the moss genus Orthotrichum#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the Study: Ultraviolet (UV) radiation influences the viability of algal spores and seed-plant pollen depending on the species, the dose, and the wavelength. In bryophytes, one of the dominant groups of plants in many habitats, UV radiation could determine their spore dispersal strategy, and such data are critical for reconstructing the ancestral state in plants and for determining the distribution range and persistence of bryophyte species. Methods: Spores of four bryophyte species of the moss genus Orthotrichum that were either hygrochastic or xerochastic (spores dispersed under wet or dry conditions, respectively) were exposed to realistic doses of UV radiation under laboratory conditions. Spore viability was evaluated through germination experiments and, for the first time in bryophytes, ultrastructural observations. Given that the UV-B doses used were relatively higher than the UV-A doses, the UV effect was probably due more to UV-B than UV-A wavelengths. Key Results: All four species reduced their spore germination capacity in a UV dose-dependent manner, concomitantly increasing spore ultrastructural damage (cytoplasmic and plastid alterations). Most spores eventually died when exposed to the highest UV dose. Interestingly, spores of hygrochastic species were much more UV-sensitive than those of xerochastic species. Conclusions: UV tolerance determines moss spore viability, as indicated by germination capacity and ultrastructural damage, and differs between spores of species with different dispersal strategies. Specifically, the higher UV tolerance of xerochastic spores may enable them to be dispersed to longer distances than hygrochastic spores, thus extending more efficiently the distribution range of the corresponding species. © 2018 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
