#ITI#Origin and diversification of winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (L.) DC.), a multipurpose underutilized legume#FTI#
#IRE#Premise of the Study: For many crops, research into the origin and partitioning of genetic variation is limited and this can slow or prevent crop improvement programs. Many of these underutilized crops have traits that could be of benefit in a changing climate due to stress tolerance or nutritional properties. Winged bean (Psophocarpus tetragonolobus (L.) DC.) is one such crop. All parts of the plant can be eaten, from the roots to the seeds, and is high in protein as well as other micronutrients. The goal of our study was to identify the wild progenitor and analyze the partitioning of genetic variation in the crop. Methods: We used molecular phylogenetic analyses (cpDNA and nuclear ITS sequencing) to resolve relationships between all species in the genus, and population genetics (utilizing microsatellites) to identify genetic clusters of winged bean accessions and compare this to geography. Key Results: We find that winged bean is genetically distinct from all other members of the genus. We also provide support for four groups of species in the genus, largely, but not completely, corresponding to the results of previous morphological analyses. Within winged bean, population genetic analysis using 10 polymorphic microsatellite markers suggests four genetic groups; however, there is little correspondence between the genetic variation and the geography of the accessions. Conclusions: The true wild progenitor of winged bean remains unknown (or is extinct). There has likely been large-scale cross-breeding, trade, and transport of winged bean and/or multiple origins of the crop. Â© 2018 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
