#IRE#Regulation of ridge tillage on yield and growth of waterlogged summer maize hybrids Denghai 605 (DH605) and Zhengdan 958 (ZD958) were investigated in field conditions. Results showed that waterlogging significantly decreased leaf area index (LAI), SPAD value, and biomass, resulting in the reduction of photosynthetic rate, thereby decreased grain yield of summer maize. Grain yields of DH605 and ZD958 were decreased by 38% and 42% respectively, compared to no waterlogging treatment. However, ridge tillage was conducive to alleviate the adverse effects of waterlogging on photosynthetic performance and photosynthetic effective radiation by increasing LAI and SPAD value, and improving canopy structure. At tasseling stage (VT), the light transmittance of ear layer in ridge tillage treatment for DH605 and ZD958 was decreased by 12% and 19%, respectively, compared to that of waterlogging treatment. Visibly, ridge tillage effectively alleviated leaf senescence and the decrease of LAI and chlorophyll content induced by waterlogging, and improved canopy structure, photosynthetic effective radiation, and photosynthesis of waterlogged summer maize, and thus increasing grain yield by 39% and 50% for DH605 and ZD958, respectively, compared to waterlogging treatments.
