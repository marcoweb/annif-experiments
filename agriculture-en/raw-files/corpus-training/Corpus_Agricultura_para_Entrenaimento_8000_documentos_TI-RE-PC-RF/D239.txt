#ITI#Probing into the unique relationship between a soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida AKMP7 and Arabidopsis thaliana: A case of “conditional pathogenesis”#FTI#
#IRE#Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are beneficial soil bacteria that colonise the rhizosphere and help plants in growth, development, and stress tolerance. While there is a significant body of research elucidating their benefits to plants, studies on the “abnormal” or “unexpected” behavior of these bacteria are almost non-existent. One such study from our laboratory has previously reported a unique situation in which a certain strain of drought and thermo-tolerant PGPR, namely, Pseudomonas putida AKMP7, becomes pathogenic towards Arabidopsis thaliana under drought conditions, but not under normal (well-watered) conditions. In this study, we have probed deeper into this phenomenon of “conditional pathogenesis”. We found that, AKMP7 imparts an enhancement in plant growth under well-watered conditions, while, causing a deterioration in plant health under drought conditions. In an attempt to understand the underlying reasons for this phenomenon, we analysed the phytohormones released by Pseudomonas putida AKMP7 using LC-ESI-MS/MS technique. We identified that AKMP7 releases zeatin (a cytokinin), the auxin derivative -indole acetamide and amino acid-conjugates of auxin (indole-3-acetyl-L-alanine, indole-3-acetyl-L-phenylalanine and indole-3-acetyl-L-aspartate) in the growth medium. By treating the plants with commercially obtained forms of these phytohormones, individually or in combination with AKMP7, we identified that zeatin and auxin derivative indole acetamide can play a crucial role in the conditional pathogenesis exhibited by this bacterium on A. thaliana under drought conditions. Our work lays a foundation for further understanding the precise molecular mechanisms involved in this unique phenomenon of conditional/opportunistic pathogenesis. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
