#ITI#Vacuolar Ca2+/H+ exchanger and Ca2+-ATPase homologues are differentially regulated in tipburn-resistant and susceptible lettuce (Lactuca sativa) cultivars#FTI#
#IRE#Tipburn is a physiological disorder of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and other leafy crops that causes external and internal leaf discolouration and results in serious quality issues for the fresh produce industry. Tipburn occurrence is difficult to predict and no completely effective control methods exist. This is compounded by poor knowledge of the underlying physiological and molecular basis of the condition, which appears to be associated with deficiency of calcium and other nutrients. Vacuolar calcium transporters, which are involved in calcium homeostasis in Arabidopsis, show differential expression in tipburn-resistant and susceptible Brassica oleracea lines. We therefore investigated expression of a subset of L. sativa vacuolar calcium transporter homologues, belonging to the Ca2+/H+ exchanger and Ca2+-ATPase classes, in tipburn-resistant and susceptible cultivars. This indicated that some L. sativa vacuolar calcium transporter homologues belonging to these gene classes exhibited higher expression levels in resistant cultivars, whilst others had higher expression in susceptible cultivars or were independent of tipburn phenotype. In addition, some homologues were more highly expressed in symptomatic versus asymptomatic leaves in susceptible cultivars, suggesting that tipburn-induced increases in expression are unsuccessful in conferring resistance and that differential baseline expression of such genes is important for tipburn resistance. Knowledge of individual genes associated with tipburn resistance will improve breeding for such traits and the development of resistant lettuce varieties. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
