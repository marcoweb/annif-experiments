#ITI#Overexpression of BnMYBL2-1 improves plant drought tolerance via the ABA-dependent pathway#FTI#
#IRE#Drought stress is a major environmental challenge that poses considerable threats to crop survival and growth. Previous research has indicated anthocyanins play a crucial role in alleviating oxidative damage, photoprotection, membrane stabilization, and water retention under drought stress. However, the presence of MYBL2 (MYELOBBLASTOSIS LIKE 2), an R3-MYB transcription factor (TF) which known to suppress anthocyanin biosynthesis. In this study, four BnMYBL2 members were cloned from Brassica napus L, and BnMYBL2-1 was overexpressed in Triticum aestivum L (No BnMYBL2 homologous gene was detected in wheat). Subsequently, the transgenic wheat lines were treated with drought, ABA and anthocyanin. Results showed that transgenic lines exhibited greater drought tolerance compared to the wild-type (WT), characterized by improved leaf water content (LWC), elevated levels of soluble sugars and chlorophyll, and increased antioxidant enzyme activity. Notably, transgenic lines also exhibited significant upregulation in abscisic acid (ABA) content, along with the transcriptional levels of key enzymes involved in ABA signalling under drought. Results also demonstrated that BnMYBL2-1 promoted the accumulation of ABA and anthocyanins in wheat. Overall, the study highlights the positive role of BnMYBL2-1 in enhancing crop drought tolerance through ABA signalling and establishes its close association with anthocyanin biosynthesis. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of drought-resistant crop varieties and enhance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying plant responses to drought stress. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
