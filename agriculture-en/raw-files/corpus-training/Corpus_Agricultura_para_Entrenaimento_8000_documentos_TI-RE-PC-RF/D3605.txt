#ITI#Feeding site-dependent probing behaviour of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon Pisum Harris on three species of lupins Lupinus L.#FTI#
#IRE#Feeding site selection by the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris was studied using the technique of electronic registration of stylet penetration in plant tissues (EPG) on leaves and stems of white lupin (Lupinus albus L.), yellow lupin (L. luteus L.), and narrow-leaved lupin (L. angustifolius L.). The EPG revealed waveform C (probing in parenchyma) and waveforms E1 and E2 (salivation in phloem vessels and ingestion of sap, respectively). The differences in the duration, frequency, and proportion of various behavioural activities between aphids on stems and on leaves depended on the lupin variety. A. pisum was the most feeding site-sensitive on white lupin, var. Butan and the leaves were the preferred site. The preference was manifested mainly in the longer duration of probing and phloem sap ingestion, and shorter time to reach phloem vessels.#FRE#
