#ITI#Effect of a Commerical Competitive Exclusion Product on the Colonization of Salmonella infantis in Day-Old Pheasant Chicks#FTI#
#IRE#One-day-of-age pheasant chicks were treated orally with the competitive exclusion product Broilact® in three replicate trials. The following day the treated chicks and untreated control chicks were challenged likewise with approximately 103 colony-forming units (cfu) of Salmonella, infantis. Five days after challenge the cecal contents of the birds were examined quantitatively and by enrichment for S. infantis. In all three trials Broilact® effectively reduced colonization of the challenge organism, the mean infection factor (IF) value (the logarithmic number of colony forming units of salmonella organisms per gram of cecal contents) for the treated groups being 2.9 and that for the salmonella control groups 8.4. Mortality during the 1 week rearing period was 5.0% in the Broilact® treated groups and 8.5% in the salmonella control groups.#FRE#
