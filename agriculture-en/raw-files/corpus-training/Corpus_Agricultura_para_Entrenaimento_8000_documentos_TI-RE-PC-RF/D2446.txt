#ITI#Dynamics of the physical properties of soybean during storage under tropical condition#FTI#
#IRE#This research study was carried out for 16 weeks to evaluate the effect of ambient storage conditions on the physical properties of soybean. Two soybean varieties named Pb-1 and PM-13 were used for the experiment. The hardness, bulk density, moisture content and thousand seed mass changed significantly within the storage period (P<0.05). Hardness and bulk density of seeds increased with time while thousand seed mass and moisture content decreased with storage time in both varieties. The ‘L’ and ‘a’ color values were not changed significantly with storage time however, the ‘b’ color values were significantly altered with storage time in both varieties. Seed physical property changers are directly affected to its processing conditions such as grading, separation, drying and grinding. Therefore, soybean processing conditions and processing power requirements required to be altered accordingly. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
