#ITI#Genetic variability and divergence studies in cluster bean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub] under hill zone of Karnataka, India#FTI#
#IRE#Eighteen genotypes of cluster bean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L.) Taub] were evaluated to estimate variability, broad sense heritability, genetic advance over mean and diversity for vegetable pod yield and related attributes, during summer 2014-15. Maximum range of variability was observed for number of vegetable pods per plant, number of clusters per plant and pod yield. High heritability coupled with high genetic gain in percentage was observed for number of pods per plant, number of clusters per plant, pod yield and days to first flowering. The maximum intra cluster distance was observed in cluster I and intercluster distance was high between cluster I and cluster III, this indicated wide range of variability among clusters. The per cent contribution towards genetic diversity was high for dry pod yield per plant (29.41%) followed by number of dry pods per plant (24.18%) and seed yield per plant (16.99 %).
