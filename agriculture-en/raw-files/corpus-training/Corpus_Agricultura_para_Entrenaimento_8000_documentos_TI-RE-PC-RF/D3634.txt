#ITI#Evaluation of some accessions of bambara groundnut (vigna subterranean l. Verdc) for resistance to bruchid infestation, based on grain source and seed coat colour#FTI#
#IRE#The relative susceptibility of different accessions of Bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranean L. Verdc) to Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) was assessed in a laboratory trial in Nigeria. Treatments were comprised factorial combinations of four grain sources from Nigeria (Enugu, Anambra, Benue and Kogi state) and three predominantly contrasting seed coat colours (black, brown, and milky-colour) laid out in a completely randomized design (CRD). There were four replications of each treatment. Egg depositions by adult C. maculatus were affected by grain sources such that ovipositions on those sourced from the state of Anambra were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those from other sources. Similarly, black coloured grains harboured more insects and eggs compared to other seed coat colours. Accesssions collected from Benue and/or those with a milky-coloured seed coat showed some levels of oviposition deterrence. However, the interaction of grain source and seed coat colour was not significant based on oviposition, adult emergence, and mortality counts. Grain sources and seed coat colour were, therefore, important traits to be considered while selecting ideotypes for resistance to C. maculatus.#FRE#
