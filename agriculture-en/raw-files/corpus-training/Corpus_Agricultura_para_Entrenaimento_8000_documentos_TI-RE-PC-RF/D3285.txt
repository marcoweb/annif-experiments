#ITI#The Effects of Gibberellic Acid (GA3) Applications on the Physiological Features of Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) under Different Salt (NaCI) Stress Conditions#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Salinity is one of the most imperative problems of farmers worldwide. Reports are available that the external application of GA3 can reduce harmful effects of salinity. Low concentration and small quantities of GA3, a phytohormone, is essential to hasten the growth and development of plants. The current study was aimed to test the efficiency of GA3 on the impart of salt tolerance in terms of better nutrient uptake under salt stress situation and to determine the effect of external giberellic acid applications on the physiological properties and proline level of peanuts under different salt (NaCl) stress conditions on the degree of resistance to salt stress in peanuts. Methods: Trial was established as split plot design with 3 replications and NC-7 variety was used as a material. The chlorophyll content in leaves, ion (K, Na, Mg, Ca) content, cell membrane permeability were searched in the research. To determine the physiological responses of groundnut in the conditions of Gibberellic asid (GA3), (0, 5, 15 mM) applications under the different salt (Nacl), (0, 25, 50, 100 mM) stress conditions at the plant growth room in the GAP Agricultural Research Institute in Şanlıurfa, Turkey in 2019. The chlorophyll content in leaves, ion (K, Na, Mg, Ca) content, cell membrane permeability were searched in the research. Result: The increasing salt applications decreases the leaf chlorophyll content and leaf ions (K, Mg, Ca) content, in contrast, increased the cell membrane permeability, proline content and sodium concentration were determined. The gibberallic asid applied externally against salt stress were determined to have the positive effects on traits; leaf chlorophyll content, ion (K, Na, Mg, Ca) content, cell membrane permeability, proline content. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
