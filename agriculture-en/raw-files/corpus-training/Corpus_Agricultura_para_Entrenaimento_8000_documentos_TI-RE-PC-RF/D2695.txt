#ITI#Suitability evaluation for pigeon pea in southern transition zone of Karnataka Plateau, India#FTI#
#IRE#Soil-crop suitability studies provide information on choice of crops to be grown on best suited soil unit for maximizing crop production per unit of land, labour and inputs. Soil-site suitability evaluation for identifying potential areas of pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) was conducted at 1:8000 scale in Basavanagiri of Mysore district, Karnataka. Detailed soil survey of study area was carried out using cadastral map and four soil series mapped with 23 soil-mapping units. The results showed that 22 per cent of total area covering four mapping units of Bg 3 soil series is highly suitable for growing pigeon pea. Whereas, sixteen units covering 122 ha is moderately suitable and two mapping units of Bg1soil series are found not suitable for pigeon pea cultivation. Soil depth, topography, effective rooting depth and gravelliness found to be major limitations for pigeon pea production in the study area. Â© 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
