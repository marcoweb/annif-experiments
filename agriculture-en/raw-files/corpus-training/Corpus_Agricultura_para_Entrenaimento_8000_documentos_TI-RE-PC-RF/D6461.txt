#ITI#Genetic relatedness can alter the strength of plant–soil interactions#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Intraspecific variation may play a key role in shaping the relationships between plants and their interactions with soil microbial communities. The soil microbes of individual plants can generate intraspecific variation in the responsiveness of the plant offspring, yet have been much less studied. To address this need, we explored how the relatedness of seedlings from established clones of Solidago altissima altered the plant–soil interactions of the seedlings. Methods: Seedlings of known parentage were generated from a series of 24 clones grown in a common garden. Seedlings from these crosses were inoculated with soils from maternal, paternal, or unrelated clones and their performance compared to sterilized control inocula. Results: We found that soil inocula influenced by S. altissima clones had an overall negative effect on seedling biomass. Furthermore, seedlings inoculated with maternal or paternal soils tended to experience larger negative effects than seedlings inoculated with unrelated soils. However, there was much variation among individual crosses, with not all responding to relatedness. Conclusions: Our data argue that genetic relatedness to the plant from which the soil microbial inoculum was obtained may cause differential impacts on establishing seedlings, encouraging the regeneration of non-kin adjacent to established clones. Such intraspecific variation represents a potentially important source of heterogeneity in plant–soil microbe interactions with implications for maintaining population genetic diversity. © 2024 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
