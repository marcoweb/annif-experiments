#ITI#Fire damage to cambium affects localized xylem anatomy and hydraulics: the case of Nothofagus pumilio in Patagonia#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Fire scars on trees are created by excessive heat from a fire that kills the vascular cambium. Although, fires are one of the most important forest disturbances in Patagonia, the effects of fire on tree physiology and wood anatomy are still unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that abnormal functioning of the cambium after a fire will induce anatomical changes in the wood. We also assumed that these anatomical changes would affect xylem safety transport. Methods: We quantified wood anatomical traits in Nothofagus pumilio, the dominant subalpine tree species of Patagonia, using two approaches: time and distance. In the first, anatomical changes in tree rings were compared before, during, and after fire occurrence. In the second, the spatial extent of these changes was evaluated with respect to the wound by measuring anatomical traits in sampling bands in two directions (0° and 45°) with respect to the onset of healing. Results: Reductions in lumen diameter and vessel number were the most conspicuous changes associated with fire damage and observed in the fire ring and subsequent post-fire rings. In addition, the fire ring had more rays than in control rings. In terms of distance, anatomical changes were only restricted to short distances from the wound. Conclusions: Post-fire changes in wood anatomical traits were confined close to the wound margins. These changes might be associated with a defense strategy related to the compartmentalization of the wound and safety of water transport. © 2019 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
