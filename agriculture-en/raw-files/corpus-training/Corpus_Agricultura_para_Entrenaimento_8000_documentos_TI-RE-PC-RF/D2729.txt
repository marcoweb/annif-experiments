#ITI#Integrated nutrient management in clusterbean (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba L. Taubert)#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted on loamy sand soil of during kharif 2008. Among the different treatments, application of 100 % RDN through Urea + Rhizobium + PSB recorded significantly higher plant height at harvest (104.7 cm), number of nodules/plant at 50 DAS (23.5), green weight of nodule/plant at 50 DAS (96.0 mg), number of pods/plant at harvest (31.1), seed yield/plant (10.12 g), 100-seed weight (5.87 g), dry matter/plant at harvest (31.74 g), Seed yield (910 kg/ha) and Stover yield (2737 kg/ha), over rest of the treatments. The highest net return (9631/ha) and BCR (2.13) were recorded with the application of 100 % RDN through Urea + Rhizobium + PSB.#FRE#
