#ITI#A natural outbreak of clinical toxoplasmosis in a backyard flock of guinea fowl in Mississippi#FTI#
#IRE#A case of a naturally occurring infection with Toxoplasma gondii in a backyard flock of guinea fowl in north Mississippi is reported. To our knowledge, this is the first worldwide report of a natural clinical infection in a flock of guinea fowl. This case was two of seven birds lost out of approximately 20 guinea fowl present in the flock. Birds reportedly exhibited lethargy prior to death. Necropsy examinations were performed on two of the dead birds. There were no gross lesions; however, intralesional protozoan cysts suggestive of T. gondii were observed microscopically. One of two guinea fowl demonstrated dramatic microscopic pathology consisting of variable multifocal necrosis, fibrin exudation, and inflammation of spleen, lung, and heart associated with protozoa cysts and tachyzoites compatible with toxoplasmosis. The bone marrow also exhibited multifocal necrosis and fibrin exudation, as well as marked erythroid and lesser granulocytic hyperplasia with intralesional protozoan cysts. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was confirmed with immunohistochemistry and PCR. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists 2012.#FRE#
