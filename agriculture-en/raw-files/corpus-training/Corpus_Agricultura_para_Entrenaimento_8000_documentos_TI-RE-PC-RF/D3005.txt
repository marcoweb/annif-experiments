#ITI#Studies on Combining Ability for Seed Yield and Its Related Traits in Blackgram [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper]#FTI#
#IRE#An experiment was carried out in blackgram using line x tester mating design to estimate the GCA effect of parents and SCA effect of 54 hybrids for yield and its traits using 27 lines and two testers. The relative estimates of variance due to specific combining ability (SCA) were higher than general combining ability (GCA) variances for all twelve traits, indicating predominance of non-additive gene action. Combining ability estimates showed significant genetic variance in lines for all traits whereas testers had significant genetic variance for nine traits. On the basis of GCA effects, among the lines and testers IC-436910, IC-413306, IC-398973, IC-343885 and HPBU-111 respectively, were good combiners for most of the traits and can be used in future breeding programme. Specific combining ability studies indicated cross IC-436910 x HPBU-111 as best specific combiner for the economically important traits viz., plant height, branches per plant, seed yield per plant and days to 75% maturity. Such crosses could be further exploited to obtain transgressive segregants in future breeding programme. Â© 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
