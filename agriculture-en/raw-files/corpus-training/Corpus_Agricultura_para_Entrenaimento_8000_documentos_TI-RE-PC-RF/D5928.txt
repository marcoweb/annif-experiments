#ITI#Carbon allocation to growth and storage in two evergreen species of contrasting successional status#FTI#
#IRE#PREMISE OF THE STUDY: A prevailing hypothesis in forest succession is that shade-tolerant species grow more slowly than shade-intolerant species, across light conditions, because they prioritize carbon (C) allocation to storage. We examined this hypothesis in a confamilial pair of species, including one of the fastest-growing tree species in the world (Eucalyptus globulus) and a shade-tolerant, slow-growing species (Luma apiculata). METHODS: Seedlings were subjected to one out of four combinations of light (high vs. low) and initial defoliation (90% defoliated vs. nondefoliated) for four months. Growth, C storage concentration in different organs, leaf shedding, and lateral shoot formation were measured at the end of the experiment. KEY RESULTS: E ucalyptus globulus grew faster than L. apiculata in high light, but not in low light. BoThspecies had lower C storage concentration in low than in high light, but similar C storage concentrations in each light condition. Defoliation had no effect on C storage, except in the case of the old leaves of boThspecies, which showed lower C storage levels in response to defoliation. Across treatments, leaf shedding was 96% higher in E globulus than in L. apiculata while, in contrast, lateral shoot formation was 87% higher in L. apiculata. CONCLUSIONS: In low light, E. globulus prioritized C storage instead of growth, whereas L. apiculata prioritized growth and lateral branching. Our results suggest that shade tolerance depends on efficient light capture rather than C conservation traits. © 2017 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
