#ITI#Light induces an increasing release of benzyl nitrile against diurnal herbivore Ectropis grisescens Warren attack in tea (Camellia sinensis) plants#FTI#
#IRE#Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are critical compounds that directly or indirectly regulate the tritrophic interactions among herbivores, natural enemies and plants. The synthesis and release of HIPVs are regulated by many biotic and abiotic factors. However, the mechanism by which multiple factors synergistically affect HIPVs release remains unclear. Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is the object of this study because of its rich and varied volatile metabolites. In this study, benzyl nitrile was released from herbivore-attacked tea plants more in the daytime than at night, which was consistent with the feeding behaviour of tea geometrid (Ectropis grisescens Warren) larvae. The Y-tube olfactometer assay and insect resistance analysis revealed that benzyl nitrile can repel tea geometrid larvae and inhibit their growth. On the basis of enzyme activities in transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana plants, CsCYP79 was identified as a crucial regulator in the benzyl nitrile biosynthetic pathway. Light signalling-related transcription factor CsPIF1-like and the jasmonic acid (JA) signalling-related transcription factor CsMYC2 serve as the activator of CsCYP79 under light and damage conditions. Our study revealed that light (abiotic factor) and herbivore-induced damage (biotic stress) synergistically regulate the synthesis and release of benzyl nitrile to protect plants from diurnal herbivorous tea geometrid larvae. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
