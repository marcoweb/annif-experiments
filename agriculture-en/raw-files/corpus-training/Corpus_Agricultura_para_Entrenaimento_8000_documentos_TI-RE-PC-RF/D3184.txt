#ITI#Plant hormones enhance the yield by altering the physio-biological parameters in pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.)#FTI#
#IRE#A field trial was conducted using three varieties viz., VBN 1, APK 1 and VBN 3 to study the influence of plant growth regulators (PGRs) namely napthaleneacetic acid (NAA), Benzyl adenine (Cytokinin), gibberellic acid (GA3), ethrel, triacontanol, triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA,) mepiquat chloride (MC), salicylic acid (SA) and brassinolide (brassinosteroid (BR) in enhancing the yield potential of pigeonpea. The experiment was laid out in Factorial Randomized Block Design (FRBD) with three replications. PGRs have significantly enhanced the yield by influencing biochemical and physiological parameters. The variety VBN 3 outperformed the other varieties by recording highest yield. Among different PGR’s tested, BR proved its worthiness in terms of yield and its components by enhancing growth parameters and yield. It can be concluded that foliar application of BR can be used as a physiological intervention to enhance the overall photosynthetic efficiency, total dry matter production, harvest index and grain yield in pigeonpea. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
