#ITI#Biological characterization and host range of tobacco streak virus (Tsv)#FTI#
#IRE#TSV isolates (GNAP7. SFAP17 and CUKA13) maintained on cowpea were cross inoculated on five popularly grown varieties and hybrids of groundnut (JL-24, K-6, Prasuna, K-9, Kadiri harithandra), sunflower (KBSH-44, DRSH-1, NDSH- 1012, Mordent, Sunbred-275) and cucumber (Long green, Poorna, Ageti, Sheetal, Uday). Incubation period required for the initiation of local and systemic symptoms varied among different hosts and cultivars. Local symptoms of veinal necrosis, leaf yellowing and wilting, petiole necrosis, chlorotic spot, tip necrosis and systemic symptoms of mosaic, wilting, necrotic streaks on stem, bud necrosis, axillary shoot proliferation were observed in different hosts and Culivars. Out of 23 plant species tested against TSV by sap inoculation, 15 plant species were susceptible to TSV, which includes Beta vulgaris, Abelmoschus esculentus, Cicer arietinum, Solanum melongena, Ricinus communis, Chrysanthemum indicum, Phaseolus vulgaris, Gerbera jamesonii, Macrotyloma uniflorum, Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata, Tagetus erecta, Allium cepa, Phaseolus coccineus, Solanum lycopersicum, Vigna unguiculata ssp. sesquipedalis. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
