#ITI#Dry dressing of soybean [Glycine max (L.) merrill] cv. CO 3 seeds with near nano size botanicals to improve physiological performance during storage#FTI#
#IRE#The effect of seed treatment with botanicals was evaluated on storability of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill). Seeds treated with fenugreek seed powder, leaf powders of ashwagandha, tea and noni (ball milled for 1 h) @ 2 g kg-1 with 60 min shaking and stored in cloth bag for 6 months under ambient conditions. Seeds were evaluated for physiological parameters such as speed of germination, germination per cent, root length, shoot length, vigour index and dry matter production and for biochemical parameter the electrical conductivity at monthly interval. Results revealed that seed dressing with fenugreek seed powder manifested the physiological parameters at higher order with lesser electrical. Hence seed dry dressing with fenugreek seed powder obtained on ball milling for 1 h @ 2g per kg of seed maintained the germination and vigour in storage.
