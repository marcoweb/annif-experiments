#ITI#Genetic characterization, pathogenicity, and protection studies with an avian adenovirus isolate associated with inclusion body hepatitis#FTI#
#IRE#An avian adenovirus (AAV) was isolated from liver samples of two 2-wk-old broiler-breeder flocks obtained from grandparents vaccinated at 10 and 17 wks of age with an autogenous inactivated vaccine containing the European AAV 8 (8565 strain) and 11 (1047 strain) serotypes (AAV8/11 vaccine). Affected broiler-breeders exhibited clinical signs and macroscopic and microscopic lesions associated with inclusion body hepatitis (IBH). The isolated adenovirus, identified as Stanford, was molecularly characterized as European serotype 9. The pathogenicity of the Stanford strain was confirmed after inoculation of specificpathogen-free (SPF) chickens at 1-7 days of age, causing 100% and 20% mortality, respectively. The level of protection against IBH was evaluated in two broiler-breeder progenies from AAV 8/11-vaccinated grandparent flocks and a commercial broiler flock by challenge at 1 or 7 days of age with the AAV 8 and 11 serotypes and/or the Stanford strain. The broiler-breeder progenies and the commercial broiler flock exhibited protection against IBH after challenge. No significant differences in mean body weights were observed at 3 wk of age in any of the evaluated groups. We conclude that broiler-breeder progenies from 30- to 50-wk-old grandparents vaccinated with the AAV 8/11 vaccine were adequately protected against challenge with the AAV 8 and 11 serotypes and the Stanford strain.#FRE#
