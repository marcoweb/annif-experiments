#ITI#An evolutionary disruption of the buzz pollination syndrome in neotropical montane plants#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Under pollinator limitations, specialized pollination syndromes may evolve toward contrasting responses: a generalized syndrome with increased pollinator attraction, pollinator reward, and pollen transfer capacity; or the selfing syndrome with increased self-pollen deposition, but reduced pollinator attraction and pollen transfer capacity. The buzz-pollination syndrome is specialized to explore female vibrating bees as pollinators. However, vibrating bees become less-active pollinators at montane areas of the Atlantic Forest (AF) domain. This study investigated whether the specialized buzz-pollination syndrome would evolve toward an alternative floral syndrome in montane areas of the AF domain, considering a generalized and the selfing syndromes as alternative responses. Methods: We utilized a lineage within the buzz-pollinated Miconia as study system, contrasting floral traits between montane AF-endemic and non-endemic species. We measured and validated floral traits that were proxies for pollinator attraction, reward access, pollen transfer capacity, and self-pollen deposition. We inferred the evolution of floral trait via phylogenetic comparative methods. Results: AF-endemic species have selectively evolved greater reward access and more frequently had generalist pollination. Nonetheless, AF-endemic species also have selectively evolved toward lower pollen transfer capacity and greater self pollination. These patterns indicated a complex evolutionary process that has jointly favored a generalized and the selfing syndromes. Conclusions: The buzz pollination syndrome can undergo an evolutionary disruption in montane areas of the AF domain. This floral syndrome is likely more labile than often assumed, allowing buzz-pollinated plants to reproduce in environments where vibrating bees are less-reliable pollinators. © 2024 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
