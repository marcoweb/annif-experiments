#ITI#Fruit yield of Valencia sweet orange fertilized with different N sources and the loss of applied N#FTI#
#IRE#Nutrient management recommendations are needed to increase nitrogen uptake efficiency, minimize nutrient losses and reduce adverse effects on the environment. A study of the effects of nitrogen fertilization on N losses and fruit yield of 6-yr-old Valencia sweet orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.) on Rangpur lime rootstock (C. limonia Osb.) grove was conducted in an Alfisol in Brazil from 1996 to 2001. Urea (UR) or ammonium nitrate (AN) fertilizers were surface-applied annually at rates of 20, 100, 180, and 260 kg N ha-1 split into three applications from mid-spring to early fall. A semi-open trapping system, using H3PO4 + glycerol-soaked plastic foams, was used for selected treatments in the field to evaluate NH3 volatilized from applied N fertilizers. Ammonia volatilization reached 26 to 44% of the N applied as UR at the highest rate of N used. Ammonia volatilization losses with AN were lower (4% of the N applied). On the other hand, AN resulted in greater nitrate leaching and greater soil acidification than UR. A marked effect of AN fertilizer on soil pH (CaCl2) in the 0-20 cm depth layer was observed with a decrease of up to 1.7 pH units at the highest N rate. Acidification was followed by a decrease in exchangeable Ca and Mg; consequently, after 5 yr of fertilization with AN, soil base saturation dropped from 77% in the plots treated with 20 kg N ha-1 per year, to 24% in those that received 260 kg N ha-1 per year. The effect of N sources on fruit yield varied from year to year. In 2001, for a calculated N application rate of 150 kg ha-1, the fertilizer efficiency index of UR was 75% of that of AN.#FRE#
