#ITI#Peanut genotypes with high chlorophyll content and low leaf temperature are preferred in breeding program for drought prone areas#FTI#
#IRE#An understanding of drought stress and water use in relation to plant growth is of importance for sustainable agriculture. Groundnut genotypes respond differently to different stages of drought stress. The aim of this research was to study the response of groundnut genotypes to different stages of moisture stress. Seven groundnut genotypes (Samnut 25, Kwankwaso, Maibargo, Samnut 23, Samnut 24, EX dakar and Samnut 21) and three water supply (80% field capacity, 40% field capacity and without irrigation) with three replications were used for the study. The water stress was imposed after 14 days of initial growth of the plants and was maintained by using TDR to check the moisture level every three days. Significant differences was observed between the genotypes for leaf temperature and chlorophyll content at two weeks after imposition of moisture stress. Also, significant differences was observed between the moisture levels for all variable measured except for the chlorophyll content before imposing moisture stress. An interaction effect was observed between the genotypes and water stress for root length and Mai Bargo produced the highest root length when terminal drought was simulated. The research shows that the genotypes have varying responses to leaf temperature and chlorophyll content and will consistently vary under different moisture stresses. Therefore, genotypes identified with high chlorophyll content and low leaf temperature can be selected as parents for further breeding program or introduction into drought prone areas. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
