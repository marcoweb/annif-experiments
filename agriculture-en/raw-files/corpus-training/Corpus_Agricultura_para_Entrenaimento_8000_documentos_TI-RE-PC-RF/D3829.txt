#ITI#Effect of different constant temperatures on biology of schizaphis Graminum (Rondani) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on Barley, hordeum vulgare L. (Poaceae) in Iran#FTI#
#IRE#The temperature dependent biology of greenbug, Schizaphis graminum Rondani on Kavir barley cultivar was studied at seven constant temperatures including 10, 15, 19, 22, 26, 31, and 33±1°C, 70% relative humidity (RH), and a photoperiod of 16:8 (L:D) hours. The period of immature development ranged between 6.60 days at 26°C to 28.56 days at 10°C, respectively. All tested aphids failed to develop at 33°C. The calculated rm and λ values were significantly the highest at 26°C and lowest at 10°C, respectively. The mean generation time and doubling time of S. graminum decreased linearly by increasing the temperature from 10 to 26°C. Additionally, the total number of offsprings per female was extremely low at 10 and 31°C, contrary to the highest and lowest values of life expectancy at 10°C (41.73 days) and 31°C (7.66 days), respectively. The results of the present study revealed that temperature had great effects on biology of S. graminum, which was never previously studied on barley in Iran.#FRE#
