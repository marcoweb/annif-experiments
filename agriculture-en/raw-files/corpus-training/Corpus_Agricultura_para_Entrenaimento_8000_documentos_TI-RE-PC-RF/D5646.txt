#ITI#Contrasting effects of nectar yeasts on the reproduction of Mediterranean plant species#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Yeasts are often present in floral nectar and can influence plant fitness directly (independently of pollinators) or indirectly by influencing pollinator visitation and behavior. However, few studies have assessed the effect of nectar yeasts on plant reproductive success or compared effects across different plant species, limiting our understanding of the relative impact of direct vs. indirect effects. Methods: We inoculated the nectar of six plant species in the field with the cosmopolitan yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii to analyze the direct and indirect effects on female reproductive success over 2 years. The pollinator assemblage for each species was recorded during both flowering years. Results: Direct yeast effects on female fecundity were statistically nonsignificant for all plant species. There were significant indirect, pollinator-mediated effects on fruit production and seed mass for the two species pollinated almost exclusively by bumblebees or hawkmoths, with the direction of the effects differing for the quantity- and quality-related fitness components. There were no consistent effects of the yeast on maternal fecundity for any of the species with diverse pollinator assemblages. Conclusions: Effects of M. reukaufii on plant reproduction ranged from negative to neutral or positive depending on the plant species. The among-species variation in the indirect effects of nectar yeasts on plant pollination could reflect variation in the pollinator community, the specific microbes colonizing the nectar, and the order of microbial infection (priority effects), determining potential species interactions. Elucidating the nature of these multitrophic plant–pollinator–microbe interactions is important to understand complex processes underlying plant pollination. © 2022 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
