#ITI#Congenital skeletal abnormalities in a tawny owl chick (Strix aluco)#FTI#
#IRE#In this case report, we describe a tawny owl chick (Strix aluco) coming from a Wild Fauna Recovery Center with multiple congenital malformations in the limbs. The animal was unable to fly and showed marked malnutrition and poor general appearance. Physical, radiologic, and anatomic examinations showed osseous malformations including dislocation of radius and carpometacarpus with abnormal nonfunctional fixation of ligamentum propatagialis, absence of most parts of the bones of the manus in both wings, and twisted nonfused left tarsometatarsus with marked griphosis of digits. Routine toxicologic and pathologic examinations did not reveal a specific etiology.#FRE#
