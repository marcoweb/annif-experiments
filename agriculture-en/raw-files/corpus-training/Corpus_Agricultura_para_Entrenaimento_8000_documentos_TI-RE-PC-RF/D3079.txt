#ITI#Genetic divergence, heritability and genetic advance in mutant lines of urdbean [Vigna mungo (L.) hepper]#FTI#
#IRE#                             Twenty six mutant lines of urdbean [Vigna mungo (L) Hepper] were analyzed for genetic diversity using Mahalanobis D                             2                              statistics. Based on twelve important agronomic characters, the genotypes were grouped into 4 clusters. Group I had maximum number of mutant lines (13) followed by II and III with 9 and 4 mutant lines respectively. Maximum intra cluster divergence was found for IV and inter cluster divergence was found between group II and IV. Presence of moderate magnitude of heritability in broad sense, genetic advance as percentage of mean, phenotypic and genetic coefficient of variability in respect of number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, plant height and yield indicated ample scope for selection for superior mutants due to preponderance of additive gene action.
