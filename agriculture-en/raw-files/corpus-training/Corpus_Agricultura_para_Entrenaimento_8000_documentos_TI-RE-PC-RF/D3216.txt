#ITI#Evaluation of green gram genotypes for drought tolerance by PEG (polyethylene glycol) induced drought stress at seedling stage#FTI#
#IRE#Drought stress is one of the major constraints for pulse production which negatively affecting its growth and production. Screening and selection of desirable genotypes for drought tolerance is the first and foremost important step in pulse breeding program. In green gram standardization for moisture stress was done under laboratory conditions using various concentration of PEG 6000 and 50% seedling mortality was observed at 0.5 MPa of moisture stress. Using this level of moisture stress 108 green gram genotypes were screened for their drought tolerance at seedling level and the following parameters viz., germination percentage, promptness index, radicle length, root length stress index, germination stress index and seed vigour were recorded. Observations revealed that the following green gram genotypes COGG 1332, VGG 16069, VGG 17003, VGG 17004, VGG 17009, VGG 17019 and VGG 17045 were found highly tolerant to moisture stress at seedling stage.
