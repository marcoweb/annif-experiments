#ITI#Population structure of cryphonectria parasitica in the Modrý Kameň region#FTI#
#IRE#The European chestnut was evaluated for Chestnut blight disease in the Modrý Kameň region, in 2010. A total of 1321 trees and sprouts were selected. There were 140 healthy trees, without any symptoms of Cryphonectria parasitica infection. Nearly 90% of the evaluated trees and sprouts were diseased. The health condition index (I HC) on 11 experimental plots varied from 2.31 to 4.03. Every collected sample was identified as having C. parasitica. All isolates had the orange culture morphology; all isolates were virulent. Among the isolates, 8 vc types were detected. Vc type EU-2 was dominant, it comprised 37.14% of the tested isolates. Two other vc types: EU 1 and EU 12 were frequently detected.#FRE#
