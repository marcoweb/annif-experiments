#ITI#Identification of key regulatory genes involved in the sporophyte and gametophyte development in Ginkgo biloba ovules revealed by in situ expression analyses#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: In Arabidopsis thaliana, the role of the most important key genes that regulate ovule development is widely known. In nonmodel species, and especially in gymnosperms, the ovule developmental processes are still quite obscure. In this study, we describe the putative roles of Ginkgo biloba orthologs of regulatory genes during ovule development. Specifically, we studied AGAMOUS (AG), AGAMOUS-like 6 (AGL6), AINTEGUMENTA (ANT), BELL1 (BEL1), Class III HD-Zip, and YABBY Ginkgo genes. Methods: We analyzed their expression domains through in situ hybridizations on two stages of ovule development: the very early stage that corresponds to the ovule primordium, still within wintering buds, and the late stage at pollination time. Results: GBM5 (Ginkgo ortholog of AG), GbMADS8 (ortholog of AGL6) and GbC3HDZ1-2-3 were expressed in both the stages of ovule development, while GbMADS1, GbAGL6-like genes (orthologs of AGL6), GbBEL1-2 and YABBY Ginkgo orthologs (GbiYAB1B and GbiYABC) seem mostly involved at pollination time. GbANTL1 was not expressed in the studied stages and was different from GbANTL2 and GbBEL1, which seem to be involved at both stages of ovule development. In Ginkgo, the investigated genes display patterns of expression only partially comparable to those of other studied seed plants. Conclusions: The expression of most of these regulatory genes in the female gametophyte region at pollination time leads to suggest a communication between the sporophytic maternal tissue and the developing female gametophyte, as demonstrated for well-studied model angiosperms. © 2022 The Authors.
