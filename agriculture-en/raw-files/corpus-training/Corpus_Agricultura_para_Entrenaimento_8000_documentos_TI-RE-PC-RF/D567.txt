#ITI#PeGRF6-PeGIF1 complex regulates cell proliferation in the leaf of Phalaenopsis equestris#FTI#
#IRE#Phalaenopsis equestris is an ornamental plant with very large leaves. In this study, we identified genes related to the regulation of leaf development in Phalaenopsis and explored their mechanism of action. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses revealed that PeGRF6 in the PeGRF family of P. equestris has similarities with the Arabidopsis genes AtGRF1 and AtGRF2, which are known to be involved in the regulation of leaf development. Among the PeGRFs, PeGRF6 was continuously and stably expressed at various stages of leaf development. The functions of PeGRF6 and of its complex formed with PeGIF1 in leaf development were verified by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology. The results show that the PeGRF6-PeGIF1 complex forms in the nucleus and positively regulates leaf cell proliferation via influencing cell size. Interestingly, VIGS suppression of PeGRF6 resulted in anthocyanin accumulation in Phalaenopsis leaves. Analyses of the regulatory mechanism of the miR396-PeGRF6 model based on the P. equestris small RNA library constructed here suggested that PeGRF6 transcripts are cleaved by Peq-miR396. These results show that, compared with PeGRF6 or PeGIF1 alone, the PeGRF6-PeGIF1 complex plays a more important role in the leaf development of Phalaenopsis, possibly by regulating the expression of cell cycle-related genes.
