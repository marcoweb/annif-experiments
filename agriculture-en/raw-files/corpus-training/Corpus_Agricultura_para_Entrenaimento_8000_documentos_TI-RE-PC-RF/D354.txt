#ITI#Variability in morpho-biochemical, photosynthetic pigmentation, enzymatic and quality attributes of potato for salinity stress tolerance#FTI#
#IRE#Salt stress has emerged as a growing global concern, exerting a significant impact on agricultural productivity. The challenges of salt stress on potatoes are crucial for ensuring food security and sustainable agriculture. To address this issue a pot trial was executed to evaluate the impacts of NaCl in the soil on the growth, photosynthetic pigments, and quality attributes of potato, plants were grown in soil spiked with various concentrations of NaCl (0, 1, 3, 5, 7 g kg−1 of soil). Results revealed that salt stress have negative impacts on the growth, biomass, photosynthesis and quality attributes of potato. Lower level of salt stress 1 g kg−1 of soil improved the fresh and dry biomass of leaves (78.70 and 47.74%) and tubers (86.04 and 88.92%) as compared to control, respectively. Higher levels of salt stress (7 g kg−1) increased lipid peroxidation in leaves and improved the enzymatic antioxidants. It was observed that enzyme activities i.e., SOD (134.97%), POD (101.02%), and CAT (28.87%) increased in leaves and are inversely related to the NaCl concentration. The combination of reduction in chlorophyll contents and soluble sugars resulted in lower levels of quality attributes i.e., amylose (68.90%) and amylopectin (16.70%) of potato. Linear relationship in growth, biomass and physiological attributes showed the strong association with increased salt stress. Furthermore, the PCA-heatmap synergy offers identifying clusters of co-regulated attributes, which pinpoint the physiological responses that exhibit the strongest correlation with increasing salt stress levels. Findings indicate that potato can be grown successfully with (1 g kg−1 of NaCl in soil) without negative impacts on plant quality. Furthermore, this study contributes valuable insights into the complexities of salt stress on potato plants and provides a foundation for developing strategies to enhance their resilience in salt-affected environments. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
