#ITI#Soil aggregation and carbon and nitrogen stabilization in relation to residue and manure application in rice-wheat systems in northwest India#FTI#
#IRE#Soil organic matter (SOM), besides influencing carbon (C) transfer between soils and atmosphere, impacts soil functional ability and its response to environmental and anthropogenic influences. We studied the impact of continuous application of rice straw and farmyard manure (FYM) either alone or in conjunction with inorganic fertilizers on aggregate stability and distribution of C and nitrogen (N) in different aggregate fractions after 7 years of rice-wheat cropping on a sandy loam soil. Macroaggregates (>0.25 mm) constituted 32.5-54.5% of total water stable aggregates (WSA) and were linearly related (R2 = 0.69) to soil organic carbon content. The addition of rice straw and FYM significantly (P < 0.05) improved the formation of macroaggregates with a concomitant decrease in the proportion of microaggregates at all the three sampling depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm). Macroaggregates had higher C and N density as compared to microaggregates. Application of rice straw and FYM improved C and N density in different aggregate sizes and the improvement was greatest in plots that received both rice straw and FYM each year. Application of FYM along with inorganic fertilizer resulted in a net C sequestration of 0.44 t ha-1 in the plough layer after 7 years of rice-wheat cropping. Carbon sequestration was greater (1.53 t ha-1) when both rice straw and FYM along with inorganic fertilizers were applied annually. It is concluded that addition of rice straw and FYM in rice-wheat system improves soil aggregation and enhances C and N sequestration in macroaggregates. This will help in sustainable rice-wheat productivity in the region. Â© 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
