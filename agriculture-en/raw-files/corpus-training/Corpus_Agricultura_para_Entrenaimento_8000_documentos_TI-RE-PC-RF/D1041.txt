#ITI#Leaf relative water content at 50% stomatal conductance measured by noninvasive NMR is linked to climate of origin in nine species of eucalypt#FTI#
#IRE#Stomata are the gatekeepers of plant water use and must quickly respond to changes in plant water status to ensure plant survival under fluctuating environmental conditions. The mechanism for their closure is highly sensitive to disturbances in leaf water status, which makes isolating their response to declining water content difficult to characterise and to compare responses among species. Using a small-scale non-destructive nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer as a leaf water content sensor, we measure the stomatal response to rapid induction of water deficit in the leaves of nine species of eucalypt from contrasting climates. We found a strong linear correlation between relative water content at 50% stomatal conductance (RWCgs50) and mean annual temperature at the climate of origin of each species. We also show evidence for stomata to maintain control over water loss well below turgor loss point in species adapted to warmer climates and secondary increases in stomatal conductance despite declining water content. We propose that RWCgs50 is a promising trait to guide future investigations comparing stomatal responses to water deficit. It may provide a useful phenotyping trait to delineate tolerance and adaption to hot temperatures and high leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficits. © 2023 The Authors.
