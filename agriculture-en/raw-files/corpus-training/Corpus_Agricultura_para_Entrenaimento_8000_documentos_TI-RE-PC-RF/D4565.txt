#ITI#Phylogenetic analysis of six isolates of beak and feather disease virus from African grey parrots in Portugal#FTI#
#IRE#Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV), a member of the genus Circovirus, was detected in six dead African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus) in Portugal. The complete nucleotide sequences of these six BFDVs (PT05, PT08, PT08-2, PT08-3, PT09, and PT09-2) were determined and analyzed. The seven open reading frames (ORFs) described for other BFDVs were detected in all strains, except for PT05 and PT08, in which ORFs 4 and 7 are absent. Bayesian inference of phylogeny based on complete genomes of BFDVs isolated in Portugal and 32 other BFDVs found in other parts of the world revealed that PT05 is included in lineage IV, whereas the others form a new proposed genotype lineage IX. The nucleotide diversity ranged from 2 to 12 between the BFDV strains isolated in Portugal and other BFDVs found worldwide. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
