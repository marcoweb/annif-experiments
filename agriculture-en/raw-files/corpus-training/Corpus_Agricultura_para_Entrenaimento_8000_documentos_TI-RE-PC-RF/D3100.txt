#ITI#Enhanced mungbean and water productivity under full irrigation and stress using humic acid in arid regions#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during 2016 and 2017 seasons at the Agriculture Research Station of King Abdulaziz University at Hada Al-Sham, Saudi Arabia in a split plot design to investigate the response of Mungbean [(Vigna radiate (L.)Wilczek] MN-96 cv. to three irrigation water regimes(100%, 80% and 60% of water requirements)and three humic acid (HA) rates (15, 30 and 45 kg/ha HA) was mixed with the soil surface. Seed yield and yield components were significantly similar under 30 and 45 kg HA/ha. No significantly differences were showed between seed yield/ha, yield components and IWUE under the 80% water regime with45 kg/ha HA and 100% water regime with 15 kg/ha HA.
