#IRE#In the present investigation, fifteen hybrids were developed during 2014-15 by utilizing five lines (Line 12, Line 13, Line 14, Line 15 and Line 17) and three testers (Matar Ageta, Palam Triloki and Arkel) and, were evaluated along with their parents for heterosis and combining ability studies following randomized complete block design during 2015-16. Same material was evaluatedin F2 during 2016-17 to ascertain the inbreeding depression. A wide range of residual heterosis over better parent and standard checks was observed in F2 generation for pod yield and related traits. Significant values of inbreeding depression and inbreeding vigour were found for almost all the traits in different crosses. Cross L13 x T2 exhibited maximum significant and negative residual heterosis over better parent (22.59%) and SC1 (17.39%) for days to 50% flowering and for days to first picking (9.50%), also exhibited maximum significant and negative residual heterosis (12.83%) over better parent for days to first picking. Studies on GCA effects revealed that line 17 was best general combiner for number of pods per plant, pod yield per plant and amongst testers, Palam Triloki for days to 50% flowering and days to first picking.On the basis of per se performance, extent of heterosis and specific combining ability effects, hybrid 17 x Palam Triloki and L13 × Palam Triloki were identified as the best crosses for earliness in F1 and F2 respectively. L17 x Arkel and L17 x Palam Triloki were observed as best hybrid for high green pod yield per plant, pods per plant and number of pods per plant in F1 and F2 respectively. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
