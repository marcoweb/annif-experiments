#ITI#Determination of Cry1Ac copy number in transgenic pigeonpea plants using quantitative real time PCR#FTI#
#IRE#Copy number of Cry1Ac in transgenic pigeonpea plants was determined by quantitative real time PCR using Syber Green as fluorescence indicator. Gene specific primers designed to amplify relatively long amplicons (400 – 600 bp), for Cry1Ac was used to increase specificity and sensitivity of Real time PCR. Estimated copy number in transgenic lines using realtime quantitative PCR and southern hybridization was correlated and found to be same i.e. single copy number. This study shows effectivness of real-time PCR method for estimating the transgene copy number in transgenic pigeonpea plants by a simple, accurate and cost effective manner. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
