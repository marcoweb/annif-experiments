#ITI#Virulence of low pathogenicity H7N2 avian influenza viruses from the delmarva peninsula for broiler and leghorn chickens and turkeys#FTI#
#IRE#The virulence of low pathogenicity (LP) type A H7N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) isolates recovered from chickens in Delaware and the eastern shore of Maryland in 2004 was evaluated. Three-week-old leghorn- and broiler-type chickens and turkeys were inoculated via the conjunctival sac with 10 3.5-104.0 50% embryo infectious dose (EID50) of virus per bird with A/ chicken/Delaware/Viva/04, A/chicken/Delaware/Hobo/04, and A/chicken/Maryland/Minh Ma/04. In broilers, the viruses produced respiratory signs, airsacculitis, and microscopic lesions in the trachea and lung. In contrast, signs and lesions were less severe in turkeys, and they were rarely observed in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) leghorns. In broilers and SPF leghorns, AIV peaked on day 3 postinoculation (PI), based on virus isolation and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and antigen capture testing. Infection in turkeys peaked on day 7 PI. Serum antibodies generally were detected earlier in broilers (day 7 PI) than in turkeys or SPF leghorns (day 14 PI) using agar gel immunodiffusion, hemagglutination-inhibition, and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A second trial was performed to further examine the disease susceptibility of the leghorn chicken given the comparatively mild responses noted in the first trial. A 10-fold higher dose of 104.5-105.0EID50 per chick given via the conjunctival sac was used. In addition, commercial-type leghorns were tested as were chicks from the SPF leghorn source. The higher AIV dose resulted in more rapid and consistent rates of infection and higher serum antibody responses in both types of leghorn chickens. However, as observed in the first trial, clinical signs and microscopic lesions in both types of leghorns were infrequent and very mild. These findings indicate leghorn-type chickens, which are commonly used for pathogenicity assessments because of their availability, may not be the most suitable host for evaluating the virulence potential of LP AIV.#FRE#
