#ITI#Liver granulomas due to Eubacterium tortuosum in a seven-week-old bobwhite quail#FTI#
#IRE#Three 7-wk-old Bobwhite quail were submitted for necropsy to the Douglas branch of the Georgia Poultry Laboratory Network. Grossly, one bird had multiple white foci in the liver and a mild airsacculitis. In this quail there were multiple hepatic granulomas that contained mats of filamentous bacteria easily seen in hematoxylin- and eosin-stained histologic sections. These bacteria were negative with period acid-Schiff and were not acid fast. Bacteria were gram-positive but were most evident on Warthin-Starry silver-stained sections. The appearance and histochemical characteristics of these bacteria are most consistent with Eubacterium tortuosum.#FRE#
