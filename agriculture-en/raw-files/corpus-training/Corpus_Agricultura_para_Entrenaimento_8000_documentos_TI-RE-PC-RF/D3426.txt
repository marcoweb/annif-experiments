#ITI#Efficacy of the Selected Herbicides in Controlling Weeds and Their Side Effects on Peanut#FTI#
#IRE#The field experiments were carried out at Ismailia Agricultural Research Station, Agriculture Research Center (ARC) during 2004 and 2005 seasons, to study the effect of the selected herbicides (pendimethalin, oxyflurofen, fluazifop-p-butyl and clethodim) on weeds control as well as their effect on certain crop characters of peanut Arachis hypogaea L. family leguminous, compared with unchemical control means. The results showed that pendimethalin, as pre-emergence treatment, at recommended rate, gave the highest reduction in number and dry weight of weeds per sq. meter. Whereas clethodim as post-emergence treatment at half recommended rate recorded the least effect. Mechanical mean weed free had the superior effect after 75 and 105 days from sowing, followed pendimethalin and clethodim at (recommend rate) in 2004 and pendimethalin in 2005. The results also showed that clethodim as post-emergence treatment at recommend rate was the most effective's treatment reduction on dry weight of weeds. Weed free caused percentage reduction of dry weight ranged from 91.5 to 99.8%. The results also showed that the tested herbicides increased the dry weight, pod yield and yield components, whereas there were no significant effect on the crude protein and oil content in seeds between all treatments and unweeded treatment.
