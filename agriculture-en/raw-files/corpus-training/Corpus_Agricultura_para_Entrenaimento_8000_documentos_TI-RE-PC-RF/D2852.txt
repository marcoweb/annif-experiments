#ITI#Effect of herbicides on weeds and yield of rainy season greengram (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek)#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during rainy season of 2009 on sandy loam soil to study the influence of weeds on yield of rainy season greengram (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek). Application of imazethapyr 100 g/ha at 15-20 days after sowing was found most effective in reducing population and dry weight of weeds and maximum yield of greengram Quizalofop-p-ethyl 100 g/ha applied at 15-20 DAS was also equally effective.#FRE#
