#ITI#Carbon resources of residue and manure in Japanese farmland soils#FTI#
#IRE#This study calculated the carbon (C) input to farmland soils in Japan in an effort to investigate the potential increase in soil C of farmland soils by proper application of crop residues (straw and root) and manure. The calculation was based on inventory and activity data obtained from statistics, literature sources and inquiry reports for the year 2005. The total C resources from crop residues and manure in Japan were 6.1 Tg C year-1 and 2.3 Tg C year-1, of which 4.9 Tg C year-1 and 1.9 Tg C year-1, respectively, were applied to farmland soil. The average C application rate was 1. 7 ± 1.6 Mg C ha farmland-1 year-1 and the proportion of manure was 23 ± 26%. One scenario that improved the allocation of manure and crop residue input to farmland soil increased the average C input to farmland soil to 1.8 ± 1.3 Mg C ha farmland-1 year-1. This agricultural C flow represented only a small percentage of the global warming potential of the whole of Japan. Thus, management of C resources in the agricultural sector should focus on the sustainable use of soil rather than the C sequestration potential of soil. To improve the C flow for areas with high C input, the transportation of manure to neighboring municipalities failed to reduce the excessive amount of manure since those areas are concentrated in only a few regions. Other measures were required to reduce environmental problems due to the over-supply of manure to farmland soils. For areas with low C input, the introduction of green manure, changes in cultivation methods, and land use type itself must be considered in relation to the individual C requirements specific to land use, soil type and climate conditions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
