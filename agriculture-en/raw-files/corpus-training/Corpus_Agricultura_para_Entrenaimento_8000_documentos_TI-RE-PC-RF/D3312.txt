#ITI#Productivity and Profitability of Fodder Cowpea Cultivars under Various Zinc Management Practices in IGP of India#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Soils of North-Western Indo-Gangetic plains (IGP) are deficient in zinc content which may lead to lower forage yield of cowpea. Henceforth, the adequate supply of zinc either through soil or foliar spray and selection of suitable cultivar of cowpea could enhance the fodder productivity. Methods: A field experiment was laid out in factorial randomized block design during Kharif season, 2019 to assess the effect of different zinc management practices (control; 10 kg ZnSO4; 20 kg ZnSO4; 0.5% ZnSO4 foliar spray at 20 DAS; 0.5% ZnSO4 foliar spray at 20 and 40 DAS) on productivity and profitability of cowpea cultivars (C-152; MFC-08-14; MFC-09-1) and post-harvest fertility status of soil. Result: Cowpea cv. C-152 showed the highest growth attributes, green fodder yield, nutrient content as well as uptake and net returns. Among different zinc management practices, the application of 20 kg ZnSO4 as basal application or 0.5% ZnSO4 foliar spray at 20 and 40 DAS recorded significantly highest growth, green fodder yield, nutrient content as well as uptake and net returns. Significantly highest soil OC, available N, K and Zn were also noted under these treatments. It is inferred that cowpea cv. C-152 and application of either 20 kg ZnSO4 as basal or 0.5% ZnSO4 as foliar spray at 20 and 40 DAS were found the most productive and profitable approach and sustained the soil fertility status. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
