#ITI#Phenotypic and genotypic characterization of Salmonella arizonae from an integrated turkey operation#FTI#
#IRE#Fifty cases submitted between 2000 and 2002 were selected for retrospective analysis to evaluate possible relationships between Salmonella arizonae isolated from breeder flocks, hatching eggs, and meat bird flocks belonging to a single turkey integrator. In all the meat bird cases selected for this study, arizonosis was the primary diagnosis. In birds under 1 month of age, clinical signs and pathologic changes were observed in older birds. The Salmonella arizonae isolates were analyzed by antibiotic resistance pattern and serotype and genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Serotyping and PFGE yielded similar results, but the antibiotic resistance patterns did not correspond to either serotyping or PFGE typing. The presence of common pulsed-field patterns in breeder flocks, eggs, and meat bird flocks suggested that S. arizonae was being transmitted vertically from the breeder flock.#FRE#
