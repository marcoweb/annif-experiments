#ITI#Unveiling mechanisms of silicon-mediated resistance to chromium stress in rice using a newly-developed hierarchical system#FTI#
#IRE#Silicon (Si) has been well-known to enhance plant resistance to heavy-metal stress. However, the mechanisms by which silicon mitigates heavy-metal stress in plants are not clear. In particular, information regarding the role of Si in mediating resistance to heavy-metal stress at a single cell level is still lacking. Here, we developed a hierarchical system comprising the plant, protoplast, and suspension cell subsystems to investigate the mechanisms by which silicon helps to alleviate the toxic effects of trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] in rice. Our results showed that in whole-plant subsystem silicon reduced shoot Cr(III) concentration, effectively alleviating Cr(III) stress in seedlings and causing changes in antioxidant enzyme activities similar to those observed at lower Cr(III) concentrations without silicon added. However, in protoplast subsystem lacking the cell wall, no silicon deposition occurred, leading to insignificant changes in cell survival or antioxidation processes under Cr(III) stress. Conversely, in suspension cell subsystem, silicon supplementation substantially improved cell survival and changes in antioxidant enzyme activities under Cr(III) stress. This is due to the fact that >95% of silicon was on the cell wall, reducing Cr(III) concentration in cells by 7.7%–10.4%. Collectively, the results suggested that the silicon deposited on the cell wall hindered Cr(III) bio-uptake, which consequently delayed Cr(III)-induced changes in antioxidant enzyme activities. This research emphasizes the significance of cell walls in Si-alleviated heavy-metal stress and deepens our understanding of silicon functioning in plants. Furthermore, the hierarchical system has great potential for application in studying the functioning of other elements in plant cell walls. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
