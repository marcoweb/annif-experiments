#ITI#Pearson and canonical correlations between the root properties and some yield components of chickpea (Cicer Arietinum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#This study was carried out at the research and practice areas of Ahi Evran University (Kirsehir / Turkey) between 2012 and 2013. The Azkan chickpea cultivar was used for our study material. This study was conducted using a randomized blocks split-plot design using four replications. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the relationship between the variables. Two separate sets for the root and root characteristics were investigated by canonical correlations. A negative correlation was observed between the root weight and the time of sowing where the significance of the relationship was determined to be r = -0.836**.The significance between root weight and yield were observed to be positive and the significance of the relationship was determined to be r = 0.671**. The canonical correlation between a high growth rate of roots and the features above ground was also determined. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
