#ITI#Identification of stable lentil (Lens culinaris medik) genotypes through GGE biplotand ammi analysis for north hill zone of India#FTI#
#IRE#In the present investigation with 24 lentil genotypes, first two Principal components revealed more than 90 per cent of the variability for the yield which indicates that G and GE together accounted for more than 10 per cent of total variability. Based on the present analysis of using GGE biplot models, considering simultaneous mean yield and stability, the genotypes G4, G12, G6, G13 and G2 were relatively stable in all the environments. The environment E1(Berthin) was discriminative (informative). This environment contributed most to the variability in grain yield. Hence, GGE biplot method is suitable to discriminate the genotypes based on their stable and instability nature across the environments. The AMMI analysis revealed that G13, G14, G12, G2, G23, G16 and G9 had wide adaptation and not be affected by the Genotype x environment interaction (GxE); hence mayyieldedgood across the environments. E2 and E3 could be considered as good selection sites for identifying broad based and most adaptable lentil genotypes. This study has clearly and by far aided in identification of stable and superior genotypes in graphical representation. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
