#ITI#Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.) Growth, Yield and Monetary Influence by Drip Irrigation and Mulch in Vertisols of Madhya Pradesh#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Farmers are facing many constraints related with pigeonpea cultivation therefore proper resources management and scientific practices can increase the production and productivity of pigeonpea. Drip and mulching can be a way to achieve the goal of more crop per drop. Methods: The field experiments were conducted during kharif season of year 2016-17 and 2017-18. The study area is located (23°16'48" N-latitude, 77°21'36" E-longitude) in Madhya Pradesh. The experiment was laid out in vertisols with twenty seven treatment combinations consisting of three mulching, three discharge rate (2 lph-D1, 4 lph-D2 and 8 lph-D3) and three irrigation levels viz. 60% CPE (I1), 80% CPE (I2) and 100% CPE (I3). Well treated bold seeds of pigeonpea (TJT-501) were dibbed in soil on ridge-furrow land configuration. Result: The plant height was maximum in 2 lph (175.78 cm), I2 (176.10 cm) and number of branches, number of pods per plant, seeds per pod also followed the same trend. Maximum yield was registered with D1 (16.48 q/ha) followed by D2 (14.91 q/ha) and D3 (14.46 q/ha). Irrigation level I2 (16.01 q/ha) registered 13.77% higher seed yield than I1 (14.07 q/ha). In case of discharge rate, B:C decreased as rate increased. Among irrigation level treatments, lowest value (1.26) of B:C recorded with 60% CPE whereas highest B:C (1.56) was registered with 80% CPE, which is at par with 100% CPE (1.52). It can be concluded that pigeonpea cultivation is not economical with mulch and 100% supply of irrigation during kharif. It is viable to supply irrigation as per CPE only at branching, flowering and pod development stages. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
