#ITI#Planting density and N application rate balance maize agronomic and environmental effect#FTI#
#IRE#A 2-year field experiment was carried out to determine the combined effects of planting density and N application rate on the agronomic, economic and environmental benefits of maize production. We set three planting densities (67,500, 75,000 and 82,500 plants ha−1) and five N application rates (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 kg N ha−1). Increasing planting density improved water use and N uptake, but reduced nitrate in soil. More N inputs over optimal rates decreased NUE and increased nitrate in soil. Compared to the modelling combination of planting density and N application rate that achieved the maximum yield and profit, the modelling combination that achieved the maximum net productive value retained yield and profit, but it used an N application rate that was 12–20% lower, and resulted in an 11–25% decrease in nitrate in soil. The optimal modelling combinations, which were a planting density of 74,387 plants ha−1 and an N application rate of 302 kg N ha−1 in 2017, and 73,528 plants ha−1 and 311 kg N ha−1 in 2018, achieved the maximum net productive values of 2620 $ ha−1 in 2017 and 2693 $ ha−1 in 2018. When the combinations maximized yield and profit, the environmental effect was more sensitive than that of the yield and profit. The optimal combination of planting density and N application rate curtailed N pollution without the great cost of yield and profit, which balanced the agronomic and environmental effect on maize production. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
