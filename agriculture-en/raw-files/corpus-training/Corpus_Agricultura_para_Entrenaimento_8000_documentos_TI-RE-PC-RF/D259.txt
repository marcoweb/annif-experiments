#ITI#Insight into the role of magnetic nutrient solution on leaf morphology and biochemical attributes of Rasha grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.)#FTI#
#IRE#The growth, development, and morphology of plants are extremely affected by many internal and external factors. In this regard, plant nourishing solutions take the most impact. Nowadays, the magnetization of nutrient solutions has been recommended as a promising eco-friendly approach for improving the growth and development of plants. This study was designed to explore the potential of magnetic nutrient solutions in altering morphometric characteristics as well as some physiological and nutritional attributes of Rasha grapevines. Magnetic treatments included magnetized nutrient solution (MagS) and pre-magnetized water completed with nutrients (MagW + S) at magnetic field intensities (0.1 and 0.2 T). According to the results, the most considerable changes in leaf shape and size as well as fresh and dry weights were observed in the plants treated with MagS at 0.2 T. Also, MagS 0.2 had a significant effect on increasing photosynthetic pigments, content of total soluble carbohydrates and protein, and activity of antioxidant enzymes. The content of TNK, K, P, Fe, and Cu was considerably amplified by MagW + S 0.2. Overall, the magnetic solutions had favorable influences on physiological, nutritional state, and leaf morphology of grapevines possibly through alerting water and solution properties, mineral solubility, and phytohormones signalling. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
