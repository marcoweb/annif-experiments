#ITI#Selection by genetic expression profiles of desi and Kabuli chickpea (Cicer arietinum l.) genotypes tolerant to high temperature stress#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Mexico is an important producer of chickpea; however, high temperatures during flowering and grain filling limit seed yield and seed size. Plant adaptation strategies to heat stress depend on climatic and soil conditions, but mainly on the plant genetic characteristics. The increase in heat shock proteins (HSP) production occurs when plants experience an abrupt or gradual increase in temperature in order to whithstand stress with the least damage. Methods: Sixty-five Heat Shock Protein related genes that induce transcription under heat stress were studied according to their expression profiles. This strategy allows for the selection of chickpea genotypes bearing potential heat stress tolerance. Based on the number of overexpressed (induced) genes and on its level of expression, a tolerance index was calculated. Result: Tolerant desi genotypes were: ICC 10259, ICC 13020, ICC 4958 and Annigeri; and in the kabuli type outstanding genotypes were: Mazocahui, ICCV 2, Blanco Sinaloa 92, Tequi Blanco 95, Combo 743 and CUGA 08-1210. These genotypes showed profiles with a higher number of induced genes and higher Tolerance Indexes. These genotypes will be further evaluated in the field and under controlled conditions and in the near future used as parental stocks. Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
