#ITI#Characterization of SEC14 family in wheat and the function of TaSEC14-7B in salt stress tolerance#FTI#
#IRE#Phospholipids are important components of plant biofilms and signal transduction. They are divided into glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids. Phosphatidylinositol (PI) is an intracellular glycerophospholipid. SEC14s are PI transporter proteins that are widely presented in eukaryotic. They take part in membrane transportation, inositol phosphate metabolism and adversity stress response. To date, systematic analysis of the SEC14 gene family in wheat, especially the function of SEC14 in salt stress tolerance has not been reported. In this study, 106 SEC14 family members have been identified in wheat. Then, a salt inducible Sec14 family member TaSEC14-7B was selected for further functional study in response to salt stress. Expression analysis demonstrated TaSEC14-7B was induced by NaCl, PEG treatment and localized both in the cell membrane and nucleus. TaSEC14-7B over-expressing Arabidopsis increased salt stress tolerance. Under salt stress, the transgenic plants displayed higher germination rate, longer primary root length, more soluble sugar accumulation, higher antioxidant enzyme activity and lower oxidative damage than the wild type plants. Also, at the presence of NaCl stress, the expression level of ABF4, P5CS, PLC4 and AtPLC7 genes was higher in TaSEC14 transgenic Arabidopsis than in the wild type ones. All these results lay a foundation for further study of Sec14 in wheat. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
