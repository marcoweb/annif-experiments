#ITI#Influence of Seed Biopriming with Microbial Inoculants on Seed Quality Parameters in Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merril]#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation was carried out in the Department of Seed Science and Technology, College of Forestry, Ranichauri, Tehri Garhwal, Uttarakhand during 2015. A laboratory experiment was conducted to find out the influence of bio-priming on seed germination and seedling vigour. Seed germination was reported maximum for Psf-173 (93.66%) while minimum was reported for control (65.66%). Seed vigour parameter viz. root length (11.01 cm), shoot length (7.96 cm), seedling length (18.98 cm), fresh weight (8.00 g) and dry weight (1.31 g), vigour index I (1666.80) and vigour index II (115.56) was found higher for PSB treatment. Shilajeet variety had recorded significant higher values for most of the germination and vigour parameters. Shilajeet bio-primed with PSB attained higher values for majority of the quality parameters. Under laboratory condition results suggested that seed germination and seed vigour were greatly affected by different bio-agents. Among all the bio-agents, PSB showed positive influence on most of the quality parameter. However, other bio-agents had also showed significant effect over control. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
