#ITI#Transport of phosphorus forms and of nitrate through a clay soil under grass and cereal production#FTI#
#IRE#Many nutrients are lost from soil to water via tile drains. However, there are very few reliable studies of such phosphorus (P) losses under Swedish agriculture practices, especially in connection to fertiliser and slurry applications and related to nutrient balances. Tile drain losses were measured from nine experimental plots in south-west Sweden; four plots were measured for 7 years and five plots for 2-3 years. Cereals, mainly spring barley (Hordeum vulgare, L.) and oats (Avena sativa, L.), were grown in six plots, while one plot was cultivated with grass, timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis, L.), one with lucerne (Medicago sativa, L.) and meadow fescue (F. pratensis, L.), and the last one was a "set-aside" with grass (Lolium perenne, L. and Trifolium repens, L.) that was neither fertilised nor used for crop removal. Attention was paid to the forms in which P was transported to water since this has important ecological implications. Average losses of particulate P (PP) from the "set-aside land" was significantly lower than from the cereal production, but the average losses of soluble reactive P (SRP) and dissolved non reactive P (DUP) were the same. Average loss of PP from the grass ley during 3 years (0.09 kg per ha-1 y-1) was significantly less than the losses from cereal production. Total P loss of 0.3 kg per ha-1 y-1 was equal to the average loss from the Swedish monitoring network of observation fields. Compared to the average nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) leaching, which was 7 kg per ha-1 y-1 from cereals, the NO3-N leaching was very low from the plots with lucerne-grass and "set-aside". After applying and directly ploughing in 80 kg ha-1 of superphosphate for cereal production in November 1998, 0.6-1.8 kg SRP ha-1 y-1 was lost through the drain tiles. Surface application of cattle slurry in spring 1999 to the grass ley also resulted in a very pronounced increased base level of SRP. This paper documents the importance of applying slurry during dry conditions and of placing fertiliser into the soil according to crop requirements in the time perspective of one year.#FRE#
