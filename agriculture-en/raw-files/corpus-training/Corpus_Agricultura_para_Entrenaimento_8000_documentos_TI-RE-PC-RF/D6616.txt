#ITI#Simulation of heat and water transfer in a surface irrigated, cropped sandy soil#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiments were conducted to validate a one-dimensional numerical Simple Soil Plant Atmospheric Transfer (SiSPAT) model that simulates heat and water transfer through the root zone of a surface irrigated, cropped sandy soil. The model accounts for the dominant processes involved in water and heat transfer in a cropped soil. Model validation used field experimental data from 2004 and suggested that the SiSPAT model could be successfully applied to predict soil water and temperature dynamics of a cropped soil in experimental conditions. Validation resulted in high values of model efficiency (ME), and low values of root mean square deviation (RMSD) and mean bias error (MBE) between the simulated and measured values. Model predictions were obtained using field experimental data from 2005 and showed that the SiSPAT model reproduced reasonably well the experimental distributions of soil moisture and temperature. Minor discrepancies between the predicted and measured data during the prediction period can probably be attributed to the uncertainties in soil water content and soil temperature probe measurements. In addition, the influence of irrigation water temperature on water and heat transfer was ignored in the model. This could have contributed to deviations between the simulated and measured values during the experiment. Prediction results indicated that the variability of the water and heat transfer fluxes following a surface irrigation in different stages of the crop (wheat) growth season resulted from the difference in net radiation reaching the cropped soil due to the varying shielding factor as controlled by leaf area index (LAI), root water uptake, meteorological conditions and soil water regime. Furthermore, an interaction between water and heat transfer through the root zone in the cropped soil could be observed during the prediction period. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
