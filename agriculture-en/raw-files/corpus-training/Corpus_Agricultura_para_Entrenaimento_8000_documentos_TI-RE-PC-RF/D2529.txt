#ITI#Characterization of morphological and yield variation of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#Trigonella foenum-graecum L. has an important place among cultivated plants in our country as well as in the world. This study was carried out to determine the morphological and yield properties of 118 fenugreek genotypes which obtained from United States Department of Agriculture and local cultivars. Among the genotypes and controls, plant height (24.9585.15 cm), first pod height (17.00-35.78 cm), pod weight (0.63-63.05 g per plant-1), number of seed per pod (3.56-14.30), pod lenght (7.01-36.10 cm), 1000 seed weight (0.49-56.31 g) and seed yield per plant (0.21-27.44 g) were determined. As a result of study, the highest seed yield and 1000 seed weight were seen in PI 296394 genotype. Dendogram analysis grouped the set of fenugreek genotypes into two main groups and many of fenugreek genotypes in same origin were found in different groups. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
