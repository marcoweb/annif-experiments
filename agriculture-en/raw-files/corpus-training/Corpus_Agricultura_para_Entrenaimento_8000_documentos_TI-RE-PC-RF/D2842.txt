#ITI#Influence of soil application of organic manures and foliar spray of liquid biofertilizers on growth and seed yield of kabuli chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) varieties#FTI#
#IRE#The field experiment was carried out at WALMI Farm, University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad during 2015-16 and 2016-17 on organically maintained field to study the influence of soil application of organic manures and foliar spray of liquid biofertilizers on growth and seed yield of kabuli chickpea varieties. The experiment was laid in split plot design with three replications constituting two kabuli chickpea varieties and seven fertilizer treatments. The results revealed that, kabuli chickpea variety BG1105 (V1) recorded significantly higher values for seed yield and its yield attributes compared to MNK-1 (V2) while, application of 100% organics equivalent to RDP (50% FYM and 50% vermicompost) in combination with either of foliar application with Panchagavya @ 3% or Biodigester @ 10% or cow urine spray @ 10% at flowering and 15 days after flowering can be used for obtaining higher seed yield in Kabuli chickpea varieties.
