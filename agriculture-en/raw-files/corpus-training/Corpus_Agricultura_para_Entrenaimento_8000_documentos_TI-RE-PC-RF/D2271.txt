#ITI#Long-term field evaluation of phosphate rock and superphosphate use strategies in acid soils of Hungary: Two comparative field trials#FTI#
#IRE#The effect of two P-forms and the P fertilization system were studied in field trials set up on two moderately acidic Hungarian soils. Reactive Algerian rock phosphate and Kola superphosphate doses were based on the phosphorus equivalence. The experimental design makes it possible to compare the effect of annual 35 kg/ha P doses with initial one-time application of the 175 kg/ha P level in a five-year interval. Ammonium-lactate (AL)-, NaHCO3 (Olsen)- and DW-P contents as well as Lakanen- Erviö (LE)- soluble Cd, Cr and Sr contents were also determined. The results of the first five-year period are reported in the paper. Responses to P fertilization were related to the original P supply of the soils. There was no significant difference between the two P forms and between the P fertilization systems on both grain yield and P-uptake. While AL- method overestimated, and Olsen-method - on the other hand - underestimated the P supply of reactive Algerian rock phosphate, distilled water (DW)-soluble P contents indicated the soil P status more accurately. Phosphorus balances were positive after the fifth year of the trials in the P treated plots. The soluble Cd and Cr contents did not increase in the Algerian rock phosphate treated plots. On the other hand, Kola superphosphate application at 175 kg/ha P level resulted in higher LE-Sr contents in soils. The Algerian rock phosphate is an economic alternative P source on the moderately or strongly acidic Hungarian soils.#FRE#
