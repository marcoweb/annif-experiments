#ITI#Effects of different mixture ratios of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) on quality of silage#FTI#
#IRE#The study was aimed to determine the properties of silages obtained by growing different mixture ratios of grass pea and barley harvested in the flowering and spike period, respectively. The research was carried out in the experimental field of the GAP International Agricultural Research and Training Center during 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 growth seasons during two years. “Kendal” barley variety and GAP Mavisi grass pea variety were used as material.The treatments viz.,100% barley, 100% grass pea, 75% grass pea + 25% barley, 50% grass pea + 50% barley and 25% grasspea + 75% barley mixtures were used for different silage preperations. Silages were prepared with 4 replications in 3 liters plastic jars, which were mixed and compressed uniformly and sealed thight. Crude protein, crude ash, acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber and lactic acid ratios of silages were determined. According to 2-year average results; all applications were found statistically significant. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
