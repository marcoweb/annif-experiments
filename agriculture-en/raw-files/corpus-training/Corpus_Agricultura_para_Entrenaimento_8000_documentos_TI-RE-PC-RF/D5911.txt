#ITI#Effects of functionally asexual reproduction on quantitative genetic variation in the evening primroses (Oenothera, Onagraceae)#FTI#
#IRE#• Premise of the study: It has long been predicted that a loss of sexual reproduction leads to decreased heritable variation within populations and increased differentiation between populations. Despite an abundance of theory, there are few empirical tests of how sex affects genetic variation in phenotypic traits, especially for plants. Here we test whether repeated losses of two critical components of sex (recombination and segregation) in the evening primroses (Oenothera L., Onagraceae) affect quantitative genetic variation within and between populations.#FRE#
