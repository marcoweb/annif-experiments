#ITI#The soil microbiome affects patterns of local adaptation in an alpine plant under moisture stress#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: The soil microbiome plays a role in plant trait expression and fitness, and plants may be locally adapted or maladapted to their soil microbiota. However, few studies of local adaptation in plants have incorporated a microbial treatment separate from manipulations of the abiotic environment, so our understanding of microbes in plant adaptation is limited. Methods: Here we tested microbial effects on local adaptation in four paired populations of an abundant alpine plant from two community types, dry and moist meadow. In a 5-month greenhouse experiment, we manipulated source population, soil moisture, and soil microbiome and measured plant survival and biomass to assess treatment effects. Results: Dry meadow populations had higher biomass than moist meadow populations at low moisture, demonstrating evidence of local adaptation to soil moisture in the absence of microbes. In the presence of microbes, dry meadow populations had greater survival than moist meadow populations when grown with dry meadow microbes regardless of moisture. Moist meadow populations showed no signs of adaptation or maladaptation. Conclusions: Our research highlights the importance of microbial mutualists in local adaptation, particularly in dry environments with higher abiotic stress. Plant populations from environments with greater abiotic stress exhibit different patterns of adaptation when grown with soil microbes versus without, while plant populations from less abiotically stressful environments do not. Improving our understanding of the role microbes play in plant adaptation will require further studies incorporating microbial manipulations. © 2024 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
