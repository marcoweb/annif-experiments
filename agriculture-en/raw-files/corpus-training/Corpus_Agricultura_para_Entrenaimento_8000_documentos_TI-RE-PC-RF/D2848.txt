#ITI#Combining ability analysis for some agronomically important traits in pea under disease protected and unprotected conditions#FTI#
#IRE#The combining ability analysis of sixty F1s in fieldpea between 20 lines and 3 testers alongwith their parent indicated revealed non additive gene action for seed yield and other agronomic characters studied, both under disease protected and disease unprotected experimentation in fieldpea. The parents PG-3, EC-324110, TARA, NIC-11236, HFP-4, Pant P-5, Pusa-10 and HUDP-15 were identified as promising genotype for hybridization programme. EC-324110 × Rachna for disease protected condition and NIC-11236 × HUDP-15 for disease unprotected condition where as HFP-4 × LFP-326, both for the above conditions appeared the best cross combination for seed yield per plant and other yield attributes.#FRE#
