#ITI#Dynamic gene regulatory networks improving spike fertility through regulation of floret primordia fate in wheat#FTI#
#IRE#The developmental process of spike is critical for spike fertility through affecting floret primordia fate in wheat; however, the genetic regulation of this dynamic and complex developmental process remains unclear. Here, we conducted a high temporal-resolution analysis of spike transcriptomes and monitored the number and morphology of floret primordia within spike. The development of all floret primordia in a spike was clearly separated into three distinct phases: differentiation, pre-dimorphism and dimorphism. Notably, we identified that floret primordia with meiosis ability at the pre-dimorphism phase usually develop into fertile floret primordia in the next dimorphism phase. Compared to control, increasing plant space treatment achieved the maximum increasement range (i.e., 50%) in number of fertile florets by accelerating spike development. The process of spike fertility improvement was directed by a continuous and dynamic regulatory network involved in transcription factor and genes interaction. This was based on the coordination of genes related to heat shock protein and jasmonic acid biosynthesis during differentiation phase, and genes related to lignin, anthocyanin and chlorophyll biosynthesis during dimorphism phase. The multi-dimensional association with high temporal-resolution approach reported here allows rapid identification of genetic resource for future breeding studies to realise the maximum spike fertility potential in more cereal crops. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
