#ITI#Analysis of greengram genotypes based on morpho-physiological, biochemical attributes and seed yield in relation to growing season#FTI#
#IRE#The study was conducted during kharif and summer seasons of 2013-14 and 2014-15 with twenty genotypes of greengram. The mean monthly soil moisture content was 23.46 per cent for kharif season and 12.95 per cent for summer season. Significant variations in morpho-physiological, biochemical attributes and seed yield were recorded in all the genotypes. The genotype Pusa Baisakhi was found to be the highest seed yielder during kharif season which was followed by Pant Moong 4, Pratap, SGC 25 and SGC 20. The genotype Pusa Baisakhi showed the highest value for leaf area per plant, in vivo leaf nitrate reductase activity, leaf photosynthetic rate, total dry matter content per plant and number of pods per plant. On the other hand, during summer season the genotype SGC 25 was found to be the highest seed yielder followed by SGC 20, Pusa Baisakhi, Pant Moong 4 and Pratap. The genotype SGC 25 was found to record highest value for number of branches per plant, total leaf chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance, leaf photosynthetic rate and number of pods per plant. On an average during kharif season 27.21 per cent higher seed yield could be obtained compared to that of summer season. Â© 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
