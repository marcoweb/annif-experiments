#ITI#The influences of environmental change and development on leaf shape in Vitis#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: The size and shape (physiognomy) of woody, dicotyledonous angiosperm leaves are correlated with climate. These relationships are the basis for multiple paleoclimate proxies. Here we test whether Vitis exhibits phenotypic plasticity and whether physiognomy varies along the vine. Methods: We used Digital Leaf Physiognomy (DiLP) to measure leaf characters of four Vitis species from the USDA Germplasm Repository (Geneva, New York) from the 2012–2013 and 2014–2015 leaf-growing seasons, which had different environmental conditions. Results: Leaf shape changed allometrically through developmental stages; early stages were more linear than later stages. There were significant differences in physiognomy in the same developmental stage between the growing seasons, and species had significant differences in mean physiognomy between growing seasons. Phenotypic plasticity was defined as changes between growing seasons after controlling for developmental stage or after averaging all developmental stages. Vitis amurensis and V. riparia had the greatest phenotypic plasticity. North American species exhibited significant differences in tooth area:blade area. Intermediate developmental stages were most likely to exhibit phenotypic plasticity, and only V. amurensis exhibited phenotypic plasticity in later developmental stages. Conclusions: Leaves have variable phenotypic plasticity along the vine. Environmental signal was strongest in intermediate developmental stages. This is significant for leaf physiognomic-paleoclimate proxies because these leaves are likely the most common in leaf litter and reflect leaves primarily included in paleoclimate reconstructions. Early season and early developmental stages have the potential to be confounding factors but are unlikely to exert significant influence because of differential preservation potential. © 2020 The Authors.
