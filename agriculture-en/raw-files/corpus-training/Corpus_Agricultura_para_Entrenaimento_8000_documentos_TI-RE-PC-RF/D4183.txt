#ITI#Importance of differential expression of Marek's disease virus gene pp38 for the pathogenesis of Marek's disease#FTI#
#IRE#The role of pp38 in the pathogenesis of Marek's disease (MD) has not been fully elucidated. Previously, we reported the presence of two splice variants (Spl A and Spl B) for pp38. We also reported that the wild-type pp38 (WT), as well as the mutated pp38 (MUT), altered the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in infected cells. To determine whether the different forms of pp38 are important for the pathogenesis of MD, we generated RB-1B-based bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones expressing pp38MUT, pp38Spl A, and pp38Spl B. Infectious viruses were recovered from these BAC clones in chick kidney cells (CKC). The Spl A and Spl B viruses had significantly smaller plaque sizes and replicated to a lesser degree in CKC than the WT and MUT viruses. Two in vivo experiments were conducted by inoculating 7-day-old P2a chicks with 1000 plaque-forming units of each virus. In the first experiment, chicks were sacrificed at 4, 8, 11, and 15 days postinfection (PI). WT and MUT viruses had similar viremia levels using virus isolation and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays, whereas Spl A and Spl B viruses had significantly lower viremia levels than WT and MUT viruses. In the second experiment, we showed that tumor development and MD mortality were similar in the WT- and MUT-infected chickens, with all birds MD positive at 5 wk PI. In contrast, chickens infected with Spl B and Spl A had a significantly lower MD incidence at 11 wk PI, when the experiment was terminated. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
