#ITI#Effect of different dosages of emamectin benzoate 5 SG and indoxacarb 14.5 SC on pod borer, helicoverpa armigera infesting chickpea#FTI#
#IRE#The experiment on bio-efficacy of Emamectin benzoate 5% SG and Indoxacarb 14.5 SC on pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera was conducted at the Agricultural Research Station, Annigeri on variety Annigeri-1 during rabi 2010-11. Application of Emamectin benzoate 5 % SG @ 13 g a.i/ha resulted in maximum larval reduction, lesser pod damage and higher grain yield of chickpea which was followed by the same insecticide @ 11 g a.i/ha without any adverse effects of different dosages on the three natural enemies and no phytotoxic effects on chickpea crop. Further, Indoxacarb 14.5 % SC @ 75 g a.i/ha has recorded maximum larval reduction, lesser pod damage and higher grain yield of chickpea which is followed by Indoxacarb 14.5 % SC @ 50 g a.i/ha.#FRE#
