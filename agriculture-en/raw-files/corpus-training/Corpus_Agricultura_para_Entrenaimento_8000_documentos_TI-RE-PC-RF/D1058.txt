#ITI#Tilletia horrida glycoside hydrolase family 128 protein, designated ThGhd_7, modulates plant immunity by blocking reactive oxygen species production#FTI#
#IRE#Tilletia horrida is an important soilborne fungal pathogen that causes rice kernel smut worldwide. We found a glycoside hydrolase family 128 protein, designated ThGhd_7, caused cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The predicted signal peptide (SP) of ThGhd_7 targets it for secretion. However, loss of the SP did not affect its ability to induce cell death. The 23–201 amino acid sequence of ThGhd_7 was sufficient to trigger cell death in N. benthamiana. ThGhd_7 expression was induced and upregulated during T. horrida infection. ThGhd_7 localised to both the cytoplasm and nucleus of plant cells, and nuclear localisation was required to induce cell death. The ability of ThGhd_7 to trigger cell death in N. benthamiana depends on RAR1 (required for Mla12 resistance), SGT1 (suppressor of G2 allele of Skp1), and BAK1/SERK3 (somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase 3). Heterologous overexpression of ThGhd_7 in rice reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhanced susceptibility to T. horrida. Further research revealed that ThGhd_7 interacted with and destabilised OsSGT1, which is required for ROS production and is a positive regulator of rice resistance to T. horrida. Taken together, these findings suggest that T. horrida employs ThGhd_7 to disrupt ROS production and thereby promote infection. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
