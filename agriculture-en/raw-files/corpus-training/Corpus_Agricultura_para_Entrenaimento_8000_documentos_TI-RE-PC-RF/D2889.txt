#ITI#Sub surface drip irrigation studies on seed and field quality of groundnut cv. VRI 2#FTI#
#IRE#A study was conducted to evaluate the surface and subsurface fertigation application effects on groundnut seed crop performance, under two methods of sowing (conventional method and ridges and furrows) and at two levels of potential evapo-transpiration (SSDI at 75% and 100 %). The experimental results indicated that the sowing in ridges and furrows with subsurface drip irrigation at 100% potential evapo-transpiration led to a greater seed yield with higher seed quality.#FRE#
