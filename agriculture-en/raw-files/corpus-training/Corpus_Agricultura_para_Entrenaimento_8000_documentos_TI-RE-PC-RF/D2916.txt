#ITI#Performance of some promising germplasm of fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum l.) towards growth and yield and their response to accumulated heat towards rate of flowering and pod development#FTI#
#IRE#Fenugreek is an important seed spice in India. Both leaves and seeds are used which are rich in protein, vitamin A and vitamin C. It has good potential in medicinal and pharmaceutical industries especially for the presence of trigonellin and diosgenin in the seed. However in spite of all these benefits, the crops have not gained much attention of the growers. This is primarily due to the lack of information on good planting materials and using the same varieties year after years. Fenugreek crop has a definite life cycle that matches seasonal necessity. Within the dynamic range of plant–temperature relations, where short-term responses are readily reversible, phenology and productivity have been successfully linked with various measures of accumulated heat (thermal time) and predictive models validated. Through the present experiment to evaluate some promising germplasms of fenugreek, Agf-1, Agf-2, Agf-3 and the local existing varieties were found to perform well and may be suggested for cultivation in this agro climatic zone. For selection purpose towards contributing seed yield, some attributes like plant height, number of branches, pod length, seed weight per pod may be taken into consideration. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
