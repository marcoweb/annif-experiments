#ITI#The efficacy of weed management practices with crop geometries on growth, yield and economic viability of clusterbean [Cyamopsis tetragonoloba (L). taub.] varieties#FTI#
#IRE#The field experiment carried out during kharif seasons of 2015 and 2016 at Research Farm, College of Agriculture, RVSKVV, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh indicated that HG 2-20 (V2) was significantly superior under weed control efficiency, crop growth and yield attributes, seed yield and economics over HG 563 (V1). 30 cm x 10 cm (S1) crop geometry observed significantly effective over 45 cm x 6.5 cm (S2). Weed free situation (W5) was significantly superior in similar parameters; while lower values were observed under weedy plot (W6). Among herbicidal treatments; Imazethapyr 35% WG + Imazamox 35% WG (Pre-mix) @ 40 g a.i./ha (W4) followed by Imazethapyr 10% EC @ 75 g a.i./ha (W3) were achieved statistically at par and significantly effective results over rest of the treatments. In case of interaction; the significantly superior values were registered under interaction of HG 2-20 (V2) with 30 cm x 10 cm (S1) to weed free situation (W5) over rest of the interactions. Among interaction of herbicidal treatments with varieties and crop geometries; Imazethapyr 35% WG + Imazamox 35% WG (Pre-mix) @ 40 g a.i./ha (W4) combined with HG 2-20 (V2) and 30 cm x 10 cm (S1) earned significantly effective over other interactions. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
