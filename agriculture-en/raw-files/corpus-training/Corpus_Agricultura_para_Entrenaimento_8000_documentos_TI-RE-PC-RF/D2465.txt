#ITI#Tank-mix insecticide and herbicide application effects on weeds, insect-pest menace and soybean productivity in semi-arid northern plains of India#FTI#
#IRE#The effects of herbicides, alone application or in combination with insecticides, on performance of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] were examined at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi during rainy seasons of 2013 and 2014. Alone application of imazethapyr 10 SL @ 1.0 l/ha or in combination with indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 300 ml/ha and rynaxypyr 20 SC @ 100 ml/ha lowered monocot and dicot weed count, reduced weed dry matter and increased weed control efficiency in comparison with other herbicide and insecticide applications, individual or in combinations. These results suggested that the imazethapyr can effectively control different categories of weeds, especially of monocots in soybean field. However, seed yield, net returns and B: C ratios were higher in the quizalofop ethyl 5 EC (1.0 l/ha) applied plots followed by combined application of rynaxypyr 20 SC (100 ml/ha) + quizalofop ethyl 5 EC (1.0 l/ha).
