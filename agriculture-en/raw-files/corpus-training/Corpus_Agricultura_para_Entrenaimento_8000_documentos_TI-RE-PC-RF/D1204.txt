#ITI#Shade tree effects in an 8-year-old cocoa agroforestry system: Biomass and nutrient diagnosis of Theobroma cacao by vector analysis#FTI#
#IRE#Farm product diversification, shade provision and low access to fertilizers often result in the purposeful integration of upper canopy trees in cocoa (Theobroma cacao) plantations. Subsequent modification to light and soil conditions presumably affects nutrient availability and cocoa tree nutrition. However, the level of complementarity between species requires investigation to minimize interspecific competition and improve resource availability. We hypothesized beneficial effects of upper canopy trees on cocoa biomass, light regulation, soil fertility and nutrient uptake. We measured cocoa standing biomass and soil nutrient stocks under no shade (monoculture) and under three structurally and functionally distinct shade trees: Albizia zygia (D.C.) Macbr, a nitrogen fixer; Milicia excelsa (Welw.), a native timber species; and Newbouldia laevis (Seem.), a native small stature species. Vector analysis was employed to diagnosis tree nutrition. Cocoa biomass was higher under shade (22.8 for sole cocoa versus 41.1 Mg ha-1 for cocoa under Milicia), and declined along a spatial gradient from the shade tree (P < 0.05). Percent canopy openness differed between the three shade species (P = 0.0136), although light infiltration was within the optimal range for cocoa production under all three species. Soil exchangeable K was increased under Newbouldia, while available P decreased and total N status was unaffected under all shade treatments. Nutrient uptake by cocoa increased under shade (43-80% and 22-45% for N and P, respectively), with K (96-140%) as the most responsive nutrient in these multistrata systems. Addition of low-density shade trees positively affected cocoa biomass close to the shade tree, however proper management of upper stratum trees is required for optimum cocoa productivity and sustainability. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
