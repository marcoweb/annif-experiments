#ITI#Effects of bacterial populations, temperature and exogenous hydrogen peroxide on the induction of the hypersensitive response in Nicotiana tabacum against Xanthomonas perforans#FTI#
#IRE#The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of inoculum concentration, plant post-inoculation incubation temperature and exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the induction of the hypersensitive response (HR) in Nicotiana tabacum against Xanthomonas perforans. Inoculation of leaves with X. perforans at a concentration of 108 CFU · ml-1 and incubation of plants at 30°C resulted in the strongest HR elicitation. Furthermore, an exogenous supply of H2O2 accelerated X. perforans-induced HR, whereas in planta H2O2 removal by application of catalase led to a delay in HR development. Our data suggest that H2O2 has an important role in HR of N.Tabacum against X. perforans. © 2017 Ali Safaie Farahani et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2017.#FRE#
