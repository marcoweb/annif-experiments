#ITI#The use of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to assess the impact of Eimeria Infections in broiler chicks#FTI#
#IRE#A number of parameters have been used to assess the impact of coccidiosis on chickens in clinical settings as well as in experimental studies. However, a rapid way to determine body composition would be useful to evaluate or compare responses to coccidia and could give further insight into the metabolic impact of infection. The current study evaluates the use of dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to determine the impact of coccidiosis on body composition in chicks receiving inoculations with single or mixed species of Eimeria. Chicks infected with Eimeria maxima, Eimeria acervulina, or Eimeria tenella had altered parameters of body composition as measured by DEXA at 6 days postinfection (PI). The greatest effects were noted in birds infected with E. acervulina or E. maxima, where lean mass and fat were reduced from control values about 75% and 85%, respectively. In chicks infected with E. tenella, tissue and fat were reduced about 10%. Bone mineral content (BMC) was about 75% of control values in birds infected with E. acervulina or E. maxima, but only E. acervulina altered bone mineral density (BMD). The decreases in BMC and BMD are likely due to malabsorption. In chicks receiving a mixed coccidian infection, all DEXA parameters were significantly decreased at 8 days PI compared with age-matched controls. As with single infections, BMD and BMC were significantly depressed (P < 0.05). Values of all DEXA parameters were near 92% of control values by day 16 PI. Analysis of all birds in the current study indicates DEXA tissue weight slightly underestimated the gravimetrically measured weight by about 3%. The current results demonstrate that DEXA is a potentially important tool for the rapid evaluation of the effect of coccidiosis on broiler chicks and suggest it can be useful for evaluation of vaccines and other disease controls.
