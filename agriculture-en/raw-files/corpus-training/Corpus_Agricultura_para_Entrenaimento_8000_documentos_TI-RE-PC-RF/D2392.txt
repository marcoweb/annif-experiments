#ITI#Provincial potassium balance of farmland in China between 1980 and 2010#FTI#
#IRE#Great changes have been happened over the past 30 years in chemical fertilizer input in China, and thus a gross potassium (K) budget model established to evaluate the variation of farmland K balance for China in 1980 and 2010 at the national scale is important. Results indicated that total K input in 1980 was 6.8 million tonnes, in which chemical fertilizer, organic manure and other sources accounted for 5.6, 77.5 and 16.9% respectively. Total K input in 2010 was 21.6 million tonnes, in which chemical fertilizer, organic manure and other sources accounted for 43.5, 50.4 and 6.1% respectively. Total K output in 1980 was 8.1 million tonnes, in which crops removal and loss accounted for 98.2 and 1.8% respectively. Total K output in 2010 was 19.1 million tonnes, in which crops removal and loss accounted for 99.2 and 0.8%, respectively. Similar to K input, the spatial distribution of K output differed greatly. Total K deficit was 1.3 million tonnes, and the range of K balance in each province was −86.7 to 53.6 kg K2O ha−1 in 1980. Compared with that, total K surplus was 2.5 million tonnes and the range of K balance in each province was −43.0 to 256.6 kg K2O ha−1 in 2010. Chemical fertilizer K application over the past 30 years makes the great changes in average K balance from deficit to surplus in general; however, the great spatial variation in K balance drives urgent need for site-specific K nutrient management. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
