#ITI#Long-term tillage, straw and N rate effects on some chemical properties in two contrasting soil types in Western Canada#FTI#
#IRE#Long-term use of soil, crop residue and fertilizer management practices may affect some soil properties, but the magnitude of change depends on soil type and climatic conditions. Two field experiments with barley, wheat, or canola in a rotation on Gray Luvisol (Typic Cryoboralf) loam at Breton and Black Chernozem (Albic Argicryoll) loam at Ellerslie, Alberta, Canada, were conducted to determine the effects of 19 or 27 years (from 1980 to 1998 or 2006 growing seasons) of tillage (zero tillage [ZT] and conventional tillage [CT]), straw management (straw removed [SRem] and straw retained [SRet]) and N fertilizer rate (0,50 and 100 kg N ha-1 in SRet, and 0 kg N ha-1 in SRem plots) on pH, extractable P, ammonium-N and nitrate-N in the 0-7.5, 7.5-15, 15-30 and 30-40 cm or 0-15, 15-30, 30-60, 60-90 and 90-120 cm soil layers. The effects of tillage, crop residue management and N fertilization on these chemical properties were usually similar for both contrasting soil types. There was no effect of tillage and residue management on soil pH, but application of N fertilizer reduced pH significantly (by up to 0.5 units) in the top 15 cm soil layers. Extractable P in the 0-15 cm soil layer was higher or tended to be higher under ZT than CT, or with SRet than SRem in many cases, but it decreased significantly with N application (by 18.5 kg P ha-1 in Gray Luvisol soil and 20.5 kg P ha-1 in Black Chernozem soil in 2007). Residual nitrate-N (though quite low in the Gray Luvisol soil in 1998) increased with application of N (by 17.8 kg N ha-1 in the 0-120 cm layer in Gray Luvisol soil and 23.8 kg N ha-1 in 0-90 cm layer in Black Chernozem soil in 2007) and also indicated some downward movement in the soil profile up to 90 cm depth. There was generally no effect of any treatment on ammonium-N in soil. In conclusion, elimination of tillage and retention of straw increased but N fertilization decreased extractable P in the surface soil. Application of N fertilizer reduced pH in the surface soil, and showed accumulation and downward leaching of nitrate-N in the soil profile. Â© 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
