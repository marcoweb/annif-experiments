#ITI#Root exudation of carbon and nitrogen compounds varies over the day–night cycle in pea: The role of diurnal changes in internal pools#FTI#
#IRE#Rhizodeposition is the export of organic compounds from plant roots to the soil. Carbon allocation towards rhizodeposition has to be balanced with allocation for other physiological functions, which depend on both newly assimilated and stored nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC). To test whether the exudation of primary metabolites scales with plant NSC status, we studied diurnal dynamics of NSC and amino acid (AA) pools and fluxes within the plant and the rhizosphere. These diurnal dynamics were measured in the field and under hydroponic-controlled conditions. Further, C-limiting treatments offered further insight into the regulation of rhizodeposition. The exudation of primary metabolites fluctuated diurnally. The diurnal dynamics of soluble sugars (SS) and AA concentrations in tissues coincided with exudate pool fluctuations in the rhizosphere. SS and AA pools in the rhizosphere increased with NSC and AA pools in the roots. C starvation treatments offset the balance of exudates: AA exudate content in the rhizosphere significantly decreased while SS exudate content remained stable. Our results suggest that rhizodeposition is to some extent controlled by plant C:N status. We propose that SS exudation is less controlled than AA exudation because N assimilation depends on controlled C supply while SS exudation relies to a greater extent on passive diffusion mechanisms. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
