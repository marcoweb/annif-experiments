#ITI#Regeneration in cultivated (Cyamopsistetragonoloba L.) and wild species (C. Serrata) of guar#FTI#
#IRE#Different guar cultivars and the wild species of explants such as the hypocotyls, cotyledon, and mature embryo were used for callus induction and these explants along with cotyledonary node explants were used for direct shoot morphogenesis. It was established that Murashige and Skoog culture medium containing 2,4- D (2.5 mg/1) and 6-benzylaminopurine (0.5 mg/1) gave the highest frequency of callus induction using mature embryo explants in guar cultivars as well as wild species. Over 2-3 shoots per explants were observed via somatic embryogenesis on MS medium supplemented with NAA 2.0 mg/l+ BAP 0.5mg/l+ Charcoal 3g/l)) in cultivars HG 563 and FS 277 using mature embryo as explants. Direct shoot regeneration was observed using cotyledonary node explants in guar cultivars and its wild species on MS medium containing Kinetin (1.0 mg/1) + BAP 0.5 (mg/1) and maximum 2-3of shoots per explants were observed on medium supplemented with Kinetin (1.0 mg/ 1) + BAP 0.5 (mg/1) and Zeatin (l.0 mg/1). No shoot regeneration was observed in cotyledon, mature embryo, hypocotyl explants of the guar cultivars and the wild species. In vitro rooting was observed on somatic embryo derived shoots on a half strength concentration of Murashige and Skoog's culture medium fortified with Indole-3-butyric acid (0.5 mg/1) + charcoal (3g/l).#FRE#
