#ITI#Prevalence of parvoviruses in commercial Turkey flocks#FTI#
#IRE#Turkey parvovirus belongs to the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, Genus parvovirus. Since the initial report on turkey parvovirus in the United States appeared in 1983, there had been no further reports of parvovirus in turkeys until 2008. The aims of our study were to determine the prevalence of parvovirus in commercial turkey flocks using PCR; to determine their genetic relationship to previous strains identified in North America and Europe; and to test samples for enteric viruses by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A total of 169 fecal samples collected from 42 turkey farms in four different states within the United States between 2000 and 2010 were examined. We found that the most frequently detected viruses by TEM were small round viruses, accounting for 52% of the examined samples; however, the PCR detected parvoviruses in 71% of the samples. The phylogenetic analysis of partial nonstructural gene sequences showed a certain degree of variability among the turkey samples tested in the study. Moreover, there was a clear dichotomy in the phylogenetic tree between chicken and turkey samples, with the exception of one turkey isolate from 2000, which clustered together with the chicken group.
