#ITI#Impact of glomus fasciculatum and fluorescent pseudomonas on growth performance of vigna radiata (l.) wilczek challenged with Phytopathogens#FTI#
#IRE#Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani are the major soil-borne pathogens causing growth and yield depression. The present study focused on the ability of fluorescent Pseudomonas and Glomus fasciculatum on growth performance of Vigna radiata in pathogen-infested soil. The percent colonization by G. fasciculatum indicated an increase of the presence of fluorescent Pseudomonas and a decrease of the presence of Fusarium oxysporum or Rhizoctonia solani. However, the reduction of colonization induced pathogen in percent was alleviated by fluorescent Pseudomonas. Inoculation with either fluorescent Pseudomonas or G. fasciculatum or both induced a significant increase in root and shoot length, plant vigour index, dry weight and total N and P content in V. radiata as compared to uninoculated control. The impact of inoculation was much pronounced in dual inoculated plants in comparison with those inoculated with either G. fasciculatum or fluorescent Pseudomonas. In contrast, treatment of plants with either F. oxysporum or R. solani decreased the root and shoot length, plant vigour index, dry weight and total N and P content in the test legume. However, in the presence of fluorescent Pseudomonas and G. fasciculatum, the adverse effect on the pathogens on growth of V. radiata was alleviated.#FRE#
