#ITI#Influence of phosphorus and sulphur on yield and micronutrient uptake by clusterbean [Cyamopsis Tetragonoloba (L.) Taub]#FTI#
#IRE#A pot experiment was conducted with three levels of P (0, 20 and 40 kg P 2O 5/ha) and three levels of S (0, 10 and 20 kg S/ha). Grain and straw yield of clusterbean increased significantly (p=0.05) with increase in level of P and S individually as well as in various combinations. Phosphorus application increased the micronutrient uptake by 22.7 to 40.3% (Fe), 18.4 to 28.2% (Cu), 22.7 to 40.3% (Zn) and 19.1 to 35.7% (Mn) in grain, however 17.2 to 30.4% (Fe), 13.1 to 19.6% (Cu), 17.1 to 31.3% (Zn) and 11.4 to 23.6% (Mn) increase in uptake was recorded in straw. Almost similar observations were recorded regarding effect of S application on micronutrient uptake in both grain and straw. Micronutrient uptake increased by 14.2 to 17.0% and 11.8 to 17.3% (Fe), 9.7 to 12.6% and 9.0 to 11.4 % (Cu), 14.5 to 16.3% and 13.8 to 16.5% (Zn) and 11.7 to 15.2 and 7.6 to 14.3% (Mn) in grain and straw, respectively. Both P and S application resulted in increased in Fe by 28.7 to 65.4% (grain) and 28.3 to 54.8% (straw). Increased in Cu uptake reported by 21.0 to 54.6% (grain) and 20.6 to 42.8% (straw) with interaction of P and S. There was 28.6 to 65.0% and 29.1 to 54.8% increased in Zn uptake in grain and straw with application of P and S. The Mn uptake was in range of 26.6 to 62.9% for grain and 24.7 to 55.8% for straw.#FRE#
