#ITI#Sexual dimorphism in floral longevity and flowering synchrony in relation to pollination and mating success in three dioecious Ilex species#FTI#
#IRE#PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Sexual floral dimorphism may have evolved under pollinator-mediated natural selection by which female and male functions are differently influenced. We hypothesized that mating success is differently influenced by display size between sexes, under which sexual dimorphism in flowering schedule has evolved in dioecious species. METHODS: We examined sexual dimorphism in the total number of flowers per shoot, maximum daily display size, longevity of individual flowers, and flowering synchrony (maximum proportion of open flowers) in three dioecious Ilex species (I. pedunculosa, I. serrata , and I. crenata) whose female flowers are not smaller than male flowers. We compared pollinator response to natural variation of daily display size between sexes. We also examined the effect of display size on female and male success (fruit set and pollen deposition and removal). KEY RESULTS: In the three species, male shoots produced significantly more flowers than female shoots did. Although female flowers lasted longer and opened more synchronously than male flowers, maximum daily display size was larger on male shoots than on female shoots. Fruit set was significantly pollen-limited in the field in all species. Pollen deposition and/or fruit set increased withfemale display size, whereas pollen removal decreased or was approximately constant withmale display size in the three species. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that sexual dimorphism in floral longevity and flowering synchrony might enhance bothfemale and male success in relation to the display size – mating success (pollinator attraction) association irrespective of flower size dimorphism. © 2015 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
