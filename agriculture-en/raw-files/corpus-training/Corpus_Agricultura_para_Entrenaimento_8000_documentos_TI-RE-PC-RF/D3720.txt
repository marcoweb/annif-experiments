#ITI#Genetic diversity in population of fusarium solani from cumin in Iran#FTI#
#IRE#Nineteen isolates of Fusarium solani were recovered from crown and root rotted parts of cumin plants collected from the major cumin producing area in Iran during 1999-2000 using Nash-Snyder media. One hundred and fifty eight nit mutants of F. solani were generated using PDA amended with 3% and 5% potassium chlorate. Of the nit mutants generated, 47/7%, 26/6% and 25/9% were nit1, nit3 and nitM, respectively. Nit mutants were used to force heterokaryon formation to determine VCGs and their relation to pathogenecity and geographic origin. Fifteen VCGs were determined for F. solani isolates, that 12 were single members VCGs. There was no specific relation between VCGs and geographic origin in F. solani isolates. This is the first research on the genetic diversity of F. solani from cumin.#FRE#
