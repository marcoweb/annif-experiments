#ITI#Meat bone meal and fox manure as P sources for ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) grown on a limed soil#FTI#
#IRE#Phosphorus (P)-rich by-products, such as meat and bone meal (MBM) and fur animal manures, are potential P sources in plant production systems. However, the solubility of P and its availability to plants in these forms has not been evaluated. We characterized P solubility in MBM, fox manures (FoxM) and dairy manure (DairyM) by Hedley fractionation and assessed P availability for ryegrass in a pot experiment. Up to 81% of P was water-soluble in DairyM, but only about 3 and 5-28% was soluble in MBM and FoxM products, respectively. Of the P in MBM and FoxM, 90 and 65-89%, respectively, was soluble only in 1 M HCl. Most of the P was inorganic; DairyM contained the highest share (14%) of organic P. Based on ryegrass yields and P uptake in a 3-year pot experiment with three P levels (25, 50 and 100 mg kg-1), P availability was equal in the DairyM and superphosphate (SP) treatments. Compared with the availability of P in DairyM and SP, 19 and 35-54% of the P in MBM and FoxM, respectively, was immediately available to the plant; for the 3-year period with ten ryegrass cuts, the respective P availabilities increased to 63 and 69-87%. Additions of the sparingly soluble P sources MBM and FoxM increased the acid-soluble P concentrations in the experimental soil, with MBM having the strongest effect. However, the acid-soluble P fraction decreased with time. Although the immediate bioavailability of P in sparingly soluble P sources was lower than that in DairyM and SP, our results suggest that their use as a long-term P supply for perennial plants in non-calcareous soils should be encouraged.
