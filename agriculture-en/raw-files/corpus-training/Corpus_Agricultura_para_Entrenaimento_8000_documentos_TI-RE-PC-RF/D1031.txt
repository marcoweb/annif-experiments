#ITI#MdTCP46 interacts with MdABI5 to negatively regulate ABA signalling and drought response in apple#FTI#
#IRE#TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factors play crucial roles in plant abiotic stresses. However, little is known about the role of TCP genes in the drought stress tolerance of apple. Here, we found that abscisic acid (ABA) and drought treatment reduced the expression of MdTCP46, and overexpression of MdTCP46 reduced ABA sensitivity and drought stress resistance. MdTCP46 was found to interact with MdABI5 both in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction was essential for drought resistance via the ABA-dependent pathway. Overexpression of MdABI5 enhanced ABA sensitivity and drought stress resistance by directly activating the expression of MdEM6 and MdRD29A. MdTCP46 significantly suppressed the transcriptional activity of MdABI5, thereby negatively regulating MdABI5-mediated ABA signalling and drought response. Overall, our results demonstrate that the MdTCP46-MdABI5-MdEM6/MdRD29A regulatory module plays a key role in the modulation of ABA signalling and the drought stress response. These findings provide new insight into the role of MdTCP46 in ABA signalling and abiotic stress responses. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
