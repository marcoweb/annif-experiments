#ITI#Resistance to velogenic Newcastle disease virus in leghorn chickens by use of prophylactic lymphokines#FTI#
#IRE#A group of 1-day-old commercial leghorn chickens was prophylactically treated with lymphokines obtained from lymphocyte cultures of chickens previously infected with Salmonella enteritidis (S. enteritidis-immune lymphokines [SE-ILK]) with the objective to investigate the effect of SE-ILK on development of Newcastle disease (ND) infection caused by Chimalguacan strain, a Mexican velogenic ND virus (vNDV). Clinical signs, histologic lesions, and hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) serum titers were compared with four other groups, namely, chickens without SE-ILK treatment with virus challenge; with SE-ILK without virus challenge; with nonimmune lymphokine (NILK) treatment and virus challenge; with lymphokine treatment and no virus challenge. SE-ILK was administered intraperitoneally in a dose of 0.5 ml/chicken and was followed 30 min later with the challenge of vNDV in a dose of 107.6 50% embryo lethal dose/ml per bird. Birds were observed during 21 days of postchallenge. Detection of histologic changes and virus isolation procedures were carried out on the third, seventh, 14th, and 21st postinoculation days. HI tests were performed first before treatment and later on the days of histologic sample collection except on the third postinoculation day. Results showed that SE-ILK administration conferred resistance to the chickens because: 1) it significantly diminished the severity of ND infection by inhibiting appearance of clinical signs (P < 0.001), lesions (P < 0.005), and histopathologic changes (P < 0.005); 2) it decreased vNDV isolation rate from the organs (P < 0.001), and 3) it potentialized and even accelerated (P < 0.005) primary immune response by antibodies in the presence of vNDV.#FRE#
