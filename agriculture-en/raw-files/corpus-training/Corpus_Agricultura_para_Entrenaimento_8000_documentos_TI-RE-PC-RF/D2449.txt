#ITI#Effect of seed coating on germination of ciliate medick [Medicago ciliaris (L.) all.] and Snail Medick [Medicago scutellata (L.) Mill.]#FTI#
#IRE#A study was conducted in the Seed Technology Laboratory of Department of Field Crops, Pasture and Forage Crops Section, Faculty of Agriculture of Ege University, Turkey. Aim of the study was to remove the seed coat hardness by various treatments of Ciliate and Snail Medick to enhance germination which is significant in terms of agronomical handicaps of sowing small seeded legumes under field conditions. Pre-sowing seed treatments (Control, scarification by sandpaper, acid treatment with 95.0-98.0% H2SO4 for 5-10-15 minutes and soaking in water for 24-48 hours) were practiced on these small seeded legumes. All observations and tests were conducted following ISTA regulations and notifications. Germination of tested seeds highly increased by acid treatment for 10-15 minutes duration, while scarification treatment provided favorable germination rates. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
