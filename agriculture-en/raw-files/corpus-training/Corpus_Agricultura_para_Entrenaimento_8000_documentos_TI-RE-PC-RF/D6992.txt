#ITI#Regional water-saving potential calculation method for paddy rice based on remote sensing#FTI#
#IRE#To improve the calculation applicability and operability of regional water-saving potential (RWSP) for paddy rice, a calculation method based on remote sensing (RWSP-RS) was proposed. RWSP-RS consists of three sections: (a) paddy rice mapping by the decision tree algorithm, (b) rice evapotranspiration (ET) inversion under different irrigation modes by the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL), and (c) WSP based on ET (WSPE) and irrigation (WSPI) calculation by coupling water balance models for paddy fields. The RWSP-RS was applied in the Zhanghe Irrigation District in southern China in 2018 and 2019. The results showed that the three sections of RWSP-RS had high precision: paddy rice mapping errors ranged from 2% to 16%; WSPE of paddy rice errors were 26 mm and 5 mm for 2018 and 2019, respectively; and WSPI errors were 5 mm and 23 mm for 2018 and 2019, respectively. The WSPI of paddy rice in the whole region was 44.52 million m3 and 99.12 million m3 for 2018 and 2019, respectively. RWSP-RS has the characteristics of solid operability, good regional applicability, and time and labor savings, making it a recommended method for calculating the RWSP of paddy rice and contributing to regional water resource management. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
