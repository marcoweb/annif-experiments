#ITI#Atoxoplasmosis in canary fledglings: Severe lymphocytic enteritis with preferential parasitism of B lymphocytes#FTI#
#IRE#All fledgling canaries (Serinum canarius) in a small private aviary died from atoxoplasmosis during a single breeding season. The birds were clinically normal when removed from their parents at 2 mo of age, but by 3 mo of age all had died following an illness characterized by progressive lethargy, anorexia, and debilitation. Cachexia, splenomegaly, and pale foci in the liver were evident at necropsy. Microscopically, there was striking infiltration of the intestinal lamina propria by mononuclear cells that contained intracytoplasmic protozoa. Protozoa were also observed in mononuclear cells in splenic and hepatic sinusoids and in vascular or perivascular spaces of other organs, but were much less numerous. Ultrastructural features of infected enteric mononuclear cells were suggestive of lymphocytes, and the majority of parasitized cells in paraffin sections of intestine were positive for CD-79 antigen, consistent with B lymphocytes. CD-3 staining was minimal, suggesting little or no T-cell infection. The following year, after egg-laying was completed, adults were treated with sulfadimethoxine, and no further fledgling losses occurred.#FRE#
