#ITI#Tea-based biochar-mediated changes in cation diffusion homeostasis in rice grown in heavy metal (loid) contaminated mining soil#FTI#
#IRE#Foreseeable future scenarios highlight the urgency of applying eco-safe avoidance methods or tolerance to heavy metal(loid) (HM) stress in agricultural production areas of contamination. The analyses show that the Ni, Mn, As, and Cr concentrations detected in the soils of the paddy fields in the Black Sea region vary between 123.60 and 263.30; 687–1271; 8.90–14.50; 162.00–340.00 mg kg−1 proving high accumulation of Ni, Mn, As, Cr in rice. Overconsumption of rice farmed extensively on these soils might also lead to human HM-related health problems. Therefore, in the current study, the approach of using tea-based biochar (BC) proven to have one of the most significant potentials as a soil amendment to reduce HM transmission to in-vitro-grown rice plants was investigated in the soil medium naturally contaminated with HMs. The tea-BC was produced from readily available local black tea waste of a conventional fermentation process and applied in the in-vitro experiments. Among the tested doses examined, 1% tea-BC showed a more positive effect on rice plant growth and development characterized by a better relative growth rate (59.7 and 84 mg g−1 d−1 for root and shoot tissues), photosynthetic pigment intactness (62.48 μg mL−1), cellular membrane integrity (93%), and relative water (96%) than the other rates (0% BC, 3%BC, 5%BC). The mRNA expression data highlights the probability of a cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) (OsMTP11) in concert with catalase isozyme (CATa) and dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB1a) linking the HM detoxification, oxidative defense, and dehydration pathways with the help of tea-BC. At the optimum concentration (1%BC), this approach might reduce HM accumulation levels of crops planted in HM-contaminated farmlands. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
