#ITI#Detection of avian polyomavirus infection by polymerase chain reaction using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues#FTI#
#IRE#Avian polyomavirus infection in psittacines was diagnosed in tissues by the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The tissues used in the procedure were either formalin-fixed tissues embedded in paraffin blocks or fresh tissues (heart, liver, and spleen) collected from the psittacines during necropsy. DNA was extracted from these tissues and was tested with the published primers for avian polyomavirus VP1 gene in the PCR that yielded an amplicon of 550 base pair size, which was then visualized by electrophoresis. The amplicon size was consistent with avian polyomavirus. The PCR test was found to be an effective method for identifying avian polyomavirus infection in both formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded and fresh tissues from psittacine birds of different age groups.#FRE#
