#ITI#Induced mutations in soybean (Glycine max L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Frequency of chlorophyll and viable mutations have been studied following seed treatment of soybean cv.PK 1029 with gamma rays, EMS and their combinations at varying doses. Mutation rate indicated that EMS @ 0.10 % was most potent in inducing the chlorophyll mutations whereas 20 kR was most efficient in inducing the viable mutations. The frequency and spectrum of the induced chlorophyll mutations was in the order of xantha, albino, chlorina and viridis. The frequency and spectrum of the induced viable mutations was in the order of plant type, leaf type, seed type and pod type. Combination of gamma rays and EMS treatment showed high lethality in inducing both chlorophyll and viable mutations. Â© 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
