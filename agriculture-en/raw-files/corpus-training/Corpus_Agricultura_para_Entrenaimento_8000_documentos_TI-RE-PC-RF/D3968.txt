#ITI#Low prevalence of netB and tpeL in historical clostridium perfringens isolates from broiler farms in Alabama#FTI#
#IRE#The discovery of novel Clostridium perfringens toxins NetB and TpeL has initiated questions regarding their role in the pathogenesis of disease. However, data showing the prevalence of these genes in C. perfringens populations are limited to certain geographical areas. If netB and tpeL are important virulence factors for disease worldwide, one would expect to find these genes in isolates from other regions as well. To address this hypothesis, C. perfringens isolates collected from Alabama broiler farms over 15 yr ago were toxin genotyped using PCR. Each isolate was screened for netB and tpeL; the major lethal toxin genes cpa, cpb, etx, and ia; and the enterotoxin gene cpe. Results of the assay showed all isolates presumed to be C. perfringens were genotypically type A, cpe negative except for one broiler litter isolate, which was genotypically type C. Only two isolates were positive for netB. Similarly, only two isolates were positive for tpeL, one of which was also netB positive. The low incidence observed for netB and tpeL indicates that these genes are not significant virulence factors for the sampled population. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
