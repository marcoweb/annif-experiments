#ITI#Seed Priming: A Low Cost Input for Yield Maximization of Rainfed Chickpea#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Moisture availability is the major abiotic limitation in rainfed areas of the country. Reduced germination, weak seedlings and poor plant population are the major causes of low productivity of chickpea in rain fed area. Inadequate soil moisture has adverse effect on seedling emergence, germination, vegetative growth as well as reproductive growth and seed yield. Methods: The experiments were conducted at the Agriculture Research Station (Dr. PDKV), Buldana, Maharashtra, India during 2016-17 to 2019-20 (four years). The experiment consisted of 12 treatments of seed priming replicated three times in randomized block design. Result: Based on the results of four years pooled analysis it was observed that seed priming with 0.5 and 1.0% potassium nitrate resulted in higher plant population and recorded higher grain yield of chickpea crop. Seed priming with potassium nitrate for four hours resulted in the higher gross monetary returns, net monetary returns and B:C ratio. Â© 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
