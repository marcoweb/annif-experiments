#ITI#Differential expression of ethylene biosynthetic and receptor genes in pollination-induced senescence of Dendrobium flowers#FTI#
#IRE#Following successful pollination, Dendrobium orchid flowers rapidly undergo senescence. In Dendrobium cv. Khao Chaimongkol, compatible pollination resulted in faster ethylene production and more rapid development of senescence symptoms, such as drooping, epinasty, venation and yellowing, compared with non-pollinated controls or pollination with incompatible pollinia. The DenACS1 and DenACO1 genes in the perianth of florets that had been pollinated with compatible pollinia were expressed more highly than those in non-pollinated open florets. Incompatible pollinia reduced the expression of DenACS1 and DenACO1 genes in the perianth. Transcript levels of the ethylene receptor gene DenERS1 and signaling genes DenEIL1 and DenERF1 showed differential spatial regulation with greater expression in the perianth than in the column plus ovary following compatible pollination. Compatible pollinia increased ethylene production concomitant with premature senescence and the increased expression of the DenACS1 and DenACO1 genes, and suppressed the ethylene receptor gene DenERS1, whereas incompatible pollinia did not stimulate ethylene production nor induce premature senescence but induced higher expression of DenERS1 both in the perianth and in the column plus ovary. These results suggest that the increased ethylene production in open florets pollinated with compatible pollen was partially due to an increase in the expression of DenACS1 and DenACO1 genes. The compatible pollinia induced a negative regulation of DenERS1 which may play an important role in ethylene perception and in modulating ethylene signaling transduction during pollinia-induced flower senescence. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
