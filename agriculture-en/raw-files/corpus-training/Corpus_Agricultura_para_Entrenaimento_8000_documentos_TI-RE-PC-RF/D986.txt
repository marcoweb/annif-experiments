#ITI#Metabolomic and transcriptomic analysis of flavonoids biosynthesis mechanisms in mulberry fruit (Hongguo 2) under exogenous hormone treatments#FTI#
#IRE#The mulberry fruit is prized for its superior nutrition value and abundant color due to its high flavone content. To enhance comprehension of flavone biogenesis induced by external hormones, we sprayed exogenous ethylene (ETH), indoleacetic acid (IAA) and spermine (SPM) on mulberry fruit (Hongguo 2) during its color-changed period. The levels of anthocyanin, titratable acid, soluble sugar and endogenous hormones were determined after hormone treatment, integrated transcriptome and metabolome analysis were performed for mechanism exploration. Our results indicated that exogenous ETH, SPM, and IAA play important roles in mulberry ripening, including acid reduction, sugar increase and flavonoid synthesis. © 2024 The Authors#FRE#
