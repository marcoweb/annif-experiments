#ITI#Urban conditions affect soil characteristics and physiological performance of three evergreen woody species#FTI#
#IRE#Physiological studies conducted mainly in metropolitan areas demonstrated that urban environments generate stressful conditions for plants. However, less attention has been paid to plant response to urban conditions in small cities. Here, we evaluated to what extent the health and physiological functions of some Mediterranean urban species [Quercus ilex L., Nerium oleander L. and Pittosporum tobira (Thunb.) W.T. Aiton] were impacted by urban and peri-urban conditions in Pisa (Italy), a small medieval city with narrow streets that impede efficient public transport causing oversized private transport. Experimental period spanned from late-summer to winter in concomitance with the sharp increase in air pollutants. Climate and air quality, soil physical and chemical properties, and plant physiological traits including leaf gas exchanges, chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf pigments were assessed. In soil, the organic carbon affected aggregates and water stability and the concentrations of some micro-elements decreased in winter. Air pollutants impaired leaf gas exchanges and photochemical processes at photosystem II, depending on species, season, and urban conditions. Shrubs were more susceptible than the tree species, highlighting that the latter adapted better to pollutants along an urban-peri-urban transect in Mediterranean environments. This study gives information on the physiological adaptability of some of the most frequent Mediterranean urban species to stressful conditions and demonstrated that, even in a small city, urban conditions influence the physiology and development of vegetation, affecting the plant health status and its ability to provide key ecosystem services.
