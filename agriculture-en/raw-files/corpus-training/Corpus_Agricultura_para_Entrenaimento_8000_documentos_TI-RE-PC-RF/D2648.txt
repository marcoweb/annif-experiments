#ITI#Genetic diversity in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea l.) based on reaction to biotic stresses and productivity parameters#FTI#
#IRE#A set of 184 mini core genotypes along with twelve checks of groundnut were evaluated for their reaction to Spodoptera litura, late leaf spot and rust at hotspot location in addition to their studies on eight productivity traits to assess the genetic diversity during rainy season of 2017. D2 analysis based on the aforesaid traits grouped the196 genotypes into twenty-five clusters. Maximum inter cluster distance was between cluster XXIII and cluster VI (836.06) while the same for intra cluster was in cluster IV (95.94). Genotypes with resistance to different biotic stresses were distributed mainly in different solitary clusters. Cluster XIV (ICG 5051) and cluster XII (ICG 76) had genotypes with resistance to Spodoptera litura. The genotype, (ICG 12625) also belonging to solitary cluster XVIII had shown resistance to late leaf spot while the genotypes in clusters XVII (ICGV 87157) and cluster XXII (ICG 13723) had resistance to rust. Number of primary branches per plant (48.41%), hundred seed weight (13.13%), reaction to Spodoptera litura (11.33%) and yield per plant (8.33%) mainly contributed to diversity in the groundnut mini core. The genotypes, ICG 5051, ICG 76, ICG 12625, ICG 76 and ICG 4412 may serve as diverse sources for resistance to different biotic stresses in groundnut. ICG 2381, a multiple stress resistant genotype (Spodoptera litura, late leaf spot and rust) in the cluster IV can be utilised in the multiple stress resistance breeding in groundnut.
