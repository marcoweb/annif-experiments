#ITI#Studies on growth, yield and quality of edible poded dolichos bean as affected by npk fertilization#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of different N, P and K levels on growth, yield and quality parameters of edible poded dolichos bean at Kittur Rani Channamma College of Horticulture, Arabhavi, during the growing period of 2016-17 and 2017-18. The nitrogen (0 and 25 kg/ha), phosphorus (0, 50 and 75 kg/ha) and potassium (0, 25 and 50 kg/ha) were applied in eighteen different combinations. Among indivisual NPK levels, the higher level of nitrogen (25 kg N/ha), phosphorus (75 kg P2 O5 /ha) and potassium (50 kg K2 O/ha) recorded significantly maximum growth (plant height, number of primary branches, number of leaves), pod yield (162.32, 184.14 and 164.75 q/ha) and quality parameters (fiber, sugar and protein) of dolichos bean compared to lower levels in both the years (2016-17 and 2017-18) and pooled data, respectively. Similarly, among NPK interaction levels, higher fertilizer dose of 25-75-50 kg N-P2 O5-K2 O/ha (T18) registered the highest value for growth and yield parameters but it was on par with 25-75-25 kg N-P2 O5-K2 O/ha (T17) for all the characters except number of leaves and days to crop maturity during both the experimental years as well as in pooled data. Therefore, for obtaining high yield with good nutritive value, NPK fertilizer must be applied at the rate of 25-75-25 kg/ha under the Arabhavi (Karnataka) condition.
