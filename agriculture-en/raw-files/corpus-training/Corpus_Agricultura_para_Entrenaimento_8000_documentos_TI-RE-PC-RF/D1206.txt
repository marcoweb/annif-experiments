#IRE#Animal slurry stored in-house and outside is a significant source of atmospheric methane (CH4). The CH4 source strength of stored slurry is greatly affected by temperature. To improve emission calculations on a global scale there is a need for knowledge about the relationship between production of CH4 in slurry and temperature. In this study, the filling of slurry channels was reproduced in the laboratory by gradually filling 1 m-high PVC vessels during 9 days followed by incubation for 100-200 days. A preliminary test showed that little CH4 was produced from animal slurry during 10 days of incubation at 20°C, if no inoculum (slurry incubated anaerobically at the test temperature for 1.5-2 months) was present. However, the addition of 7.6% inoculum supported an immediate production of CH4. Vessels amended with inoculum and gradually filled with cattle or pig slurry were then incubated at 10, 15 and 20°C. Methane production from stored pig and cattle slurry was not significant at temperatures below 15°C, where CO2 was the main product of decomposition processes. In contrast, the anaerobic production of CH4 was high and significant relative to the production of CO2 at 20°C. Peak emissions of CH4 averaging 0.012 and 0.02 g C h-1 kg -1 volatile solids (VS) were reached within about 10 days at 10 and 15°C, respectively. At 20°C, the emission of CH4 from pig slurry was about 0.01 g C h-1 kg-1 for 10 days, and thereafter emissions increased to about 0.10 g C h-1 kg-1 VS. For cattle slurry a peak emission of 0.08 g C h-1 kg-1 VS was measured after 180 days. Degradation of organic nitrogen (N) in cattle slurry was related to the reduction of organic material as reflected in CO 2 and CH4 emission. The mineralization of organic N during storage represented 10-80% of organic N in cattle slurry, and 40-80% of the organic N in pig slurry. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
