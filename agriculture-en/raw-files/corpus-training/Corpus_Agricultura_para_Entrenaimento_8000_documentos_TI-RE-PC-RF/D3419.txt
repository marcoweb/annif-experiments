#ITI#Unconventional alternatives for control of tomato root rot caused by Rhizoctonia solani under greenhouse conditions#FTI#
#IRE#This study was done to assess the antifungal effect of some biocontrol agents effective microorganisms (EMs1), Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Bacillus pumilus, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles, black cumin and wheat germ oils as well as the recommended fungicide (flutolanil) against root rot of tomato. Moreover, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) examination was completed to identify the bioactive compounds in plant oils (dark cumin and wheat germ). Also the impact of these medicines on some biochemical and growth parameters of tomato was examined. Flutolanil was the best treatment followed by dark cumin, TiO2, EMs1, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus pumilus and wheat germ oil, individually in both test seasons. The outcomes demonstrated a marked increase in each biochemical character (chlorophyll substance, peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase) and plant development (height and fresh and dry weight) under all the tried treatments in comparison to the controls.
