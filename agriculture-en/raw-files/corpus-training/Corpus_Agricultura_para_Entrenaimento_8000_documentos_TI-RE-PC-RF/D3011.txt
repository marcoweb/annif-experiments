#ITI#Genotype x environment interaction of some dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#Beans are grown in different environments. The most important issue in bean agriculture is to increase seed yield as expected in other plants. As well reported so far, environmental factors such as rain, heat, their timing and topography affect yield and yield quality in dry beans. So, this study was conducted in 2011-2015 in Samsun (Ambarkopru and Gelemen) and Kirsehir (Mucur and Cogun) locations in order to investigate the effects of the environmental factors on dry bean. For this aim, 20 dry bean genotypes (7 cultivars and 13 pure lines) were used as plant materials. Results showed that G5, G11 and G15 genotypes were close to ideal genotypes. When the year was considered as the environmental factor, the ideal production year was in 2013 with respect to yield and yield quality, concluding that climate changes between years affected yield parameters in dry bean genotypes. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
