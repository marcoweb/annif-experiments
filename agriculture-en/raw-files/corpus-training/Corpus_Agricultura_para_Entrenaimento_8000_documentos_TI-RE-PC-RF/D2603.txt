#ITI#Impact of Cluster Front Line Demonstrations on the Yield and Economics of Chickpea under National Food Security Mission in Bharatpur District of Rajasthan, India#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Chickpea is an important legume crop that plays an important role in the food and nutritional security of people in the developing countries and contributing to protein intake. It is a soil building crop and being a leguminous crop, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic fixation, there by helps in N cycling within the ecosystem. Methods: Cluster front line demonstrations of chickpea were conducted by Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Kumher, Bharatpur (Rajasthan) during Rabi season from 2016-17 to 2019-20. A total 350 front line demonstrations were conducted on chickpea in 140 ha area by the active participation of the farmers with the objective of improved technologies of chickpea production potentials. Result: The results of the demonstrations observed that on an average yield of chickpea under improved technology ranged from 11.83 to 17.52 q/ha with a mean of 14.47 q/ha; which was 20.95 per cent more yield as compared to farmer’s practices (11.97 q/ha). Moreover, average yield was also recorded higher under demonstration (14.47 q/ha) over district (8.17 q/ha) and State (10.74 q/ha) average. The study exhibited mean extension gap of 250.75 kg/ha, mean technology gap of 627.75 kg/ha with mean technology index of 29.71 per cent. Higher mean net return of Rs. 46618/ha with mean B: C ratio of 3.10 was obtained with improved technologies in comparison to farmers’ practices (Rs. 36737/ha). The present study resulted to convincing the farming community for higher productivity and returns. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
