#ITI#Screening and selection of physio-biochemical traits to detect high temperature tolerance using multivariate analysis in tomato genotypes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill)#FTI#
#IRE#Forty-nine diverse tomato genotypes grown in an open field were exposed to high temperature by deploying polytunnel to screen their capability to tolerate high temperature. Hierarchial Cluster Analysis (HCA), a multivariate statistical technique, was performed to classify selected tomato genotypes into different clusters (cluster I [tolerant], cluster II [moderately tolerant] and cluster III [susceptible]) based on the magnitude of multi-traits responses to high temperature. Furthermore, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted to identify the crucial possible physio-biochemical and yield traits as indicators and/or responsible for high temperature tolerance and were validated by comparing its magnitude of responses in tomato genotypes of contrasting clusters (cluster I [tolerant] and cluster III [susceptible]). Genotypes classified as high temperature tolerant exhibited least reduction in traits selected using PCA. Traits like photosynthesis (eigenvector [λ] 0.19), photochemical efficiency of PSII (λ 0.19), effective photo chemical quantum yield of PSII (λ 0.15), chlorophyll stability index (λ 0.43), relative water content (λ 0.39), membrane stability index (λ 0.19) and specific leaf area (λ 0.18) were found to be greatest contributors in grouping of genotypes and showed positive correlations with number of fruits per plant (yield), respectively. Hence, results imply that PCA identified traits are indicators and/or contribute to high temperature tolerance in tomato. PCA and HCA can be considered for effective and time efficient screening of magnitude of high temperature tolerance in large group of genotypes. The selected tolerant tomato genotypes can be used for further crop improvement programmes. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.#FRE#
