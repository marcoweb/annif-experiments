#ITI#Structural Dynamics of Agri-Import-Export of Pulse Crops to the Total Agriculture Trade in India#FTI#
#IRE#India is predominantly an agricultural economy contributing presently 15 per cent to national GDP and 52 per cent of employment. The trend analysis showed an increasing trend for export of agricultural commodities except for pulse crops because of prohibition of pulse export, import of agriculture commodities also increasing. The percentage share of agricultural export is decreasing (16.88% to 10.94%) and there is moderate increase in import fluctuating between 3 to 7 per cent. Pulses export and import values ranged from 10.29 to 217.30 and 300.03 to 4017.36 US$ million during over all period (1990-2016). Overall the pulses export and import increased at compound annual growth rate of 11.22 and 14.49 per cent, respectively. Total agriculture trade export has increased from 3074.60 to 26489.18 US$M during 1990-2016 and showed positive trend. Similarly, total agriculture trade import has been increased rapidly and showed positive trend ranged from 742.43 to 23895.77 US$M from 1990 to 2016. In overall period the total agriculture trade export and import increased at compound annual growth rate 11.23 and 13.54 per cent respectively. It was also evident from the study that balance of trade was found to be positive for total agricultural trade for all the years under study. For pulses it was observed to be negative due to increased import to meet out the domestic demand because of shortage in supply/production. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
