#ITI#Assessment of somaclonal variations in embryo-derived axillary shoots of chickpea using molecular markers#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Somaclonal variation is considered as a source of genetic variation for crop improvement. It has been investigated using cytological, biochemical and molecular techniques. Methods: Genetic stability in the embryo-derived axillary shoots of 4 chickpea genotypes was assessed using eight inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and 19 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers. Result: RAPD primers produced 94 and ISSR primers produced 38 distinct and scorable alleles, with an average of 4.9 alleles for RAPD and 4.75 for ISSR primers. The polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.36 to 0.90 for RAPD and from 0.50 to 0.87 for ISSR. ISSR recognized a 90%, but RAPD recognized 82% similarity value. No absolute similarity value was between the mother plant and the regenerated shoots for the overall genotypes. At a 90% similarity value, 15 out of the 20 regenerated shoots from ‘Giza 88’ group with their mother plant using ISSR markers; however, 11 regenerated shoots grouped with their mother plant in one central cluster for ‘Giza 4’ using RAPD markers. The observed variations in the total number of polymorphic RAPD and ISSR bands and the number of bands specific to the mother and regenerated shoots, detected intra-clonal variation and genetic instability seem to be genotype-dependent. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
