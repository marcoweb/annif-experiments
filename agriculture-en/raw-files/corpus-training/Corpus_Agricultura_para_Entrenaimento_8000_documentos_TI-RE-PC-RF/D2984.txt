#ITI#Character association and path coefficient analysis for yield components and grain yield in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merill.]#FTI#
#IRE#Field experiment was conducted during kharif 2014 at the Agricultural Research Station Farm, Minjibir, Bayero University, Kano. The study was conducted to know the nature and magnitude of the associations of some yield attributing characters on grain yield in Soybean. There are eighteen treatments consisting of two levels (inoculated and non-inoculated) of rhizobium inoculation, three levels (0, 10, and 20 kg N ha-1) of nitrogen and three levels (0, 30, and 60 kg P2O5ha-1) of phosphorus. These were laid in split-split plot design with three replications. Results of the study showed significant (p < 0.01) positive associations between all the measured characters and grain yield. The path analysis also revealed that number of pods per plant has the greatest direct effect on grain yield. The greatest combined contributions of yield characters to grain yield in soybean were observed from number of pods per plant and number seeds per pod. Based on these findings, attention can be given towards improvement of number of pods per plant and number of seeds per pod as criteria for selection of soybean for increased grain yield.
