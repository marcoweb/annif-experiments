#ITI#Variation in dry matter production, partitioning, yield and its correlation in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea l.) genotypes#FTI#
#IRE#Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is one of the world’s most popular oilseed crops. Nut yield in groundnut is polygenically controlled and is influenced by its component characters. A field experiment was conducted to study the variation in respect of kernel yield and its component characters along with dry matter production and partitioning at important vegetative and reproductive growth stages in nineteen genotypes of groundnut. The correlation studies were also conducted to prioritize morphological and physiological traits for improving yield. Genotypes exhibited significant differences among them in respect of kernel yield and its all attributes. Highly significant differences were recorded in respect of dry matter production and partitioning to different plant parts at pre-anthesis (30 DAS) and post-anthesis pod filling (60 DAS) stages. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
