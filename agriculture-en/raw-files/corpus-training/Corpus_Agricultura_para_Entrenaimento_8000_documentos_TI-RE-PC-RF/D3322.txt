#ITI#Impact of Cobalt Application Methods on Chickpea Yield, Nutrient Uptake and Status of Soil#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during rabi season of 2015-2016 at Navsari Agricultural University, Navsari to study the impact of cobalt application methods on chickpea yield, nutrient content and soil status. Four cobalt application methods with three levels of each were evaluated with one absolute control and one with seed priming of water were evaluated with randomized block design with three replications. Least level of seed treatment, soil application and foliar application of cobalt gave highest chickpea seed yield and decreased there after. As cobalt levels increased, NPK content and uptake are decreased linearly in all the methods except seed priming method, however cobalt content and uptake increased linearly by seed treatment and foliar application, on the contrary it decreased linearly by seed priming and soil application of cobalt. Soil application of cobalt at 50 g ha-1 recorded highest chickpea seed yield, residual NPK and Co and which can be useful for succeeding crop and this can be recommended from the cobalt nutrition point of view in plants and animals followed by seed priming at 1 ppm.
