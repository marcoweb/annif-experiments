#ITI#Heritability and genetic advance in urdbean [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper]#FTI#
#IRE#The present investigation consisted of six genetic populations i.e. P 1, P 2, F 1, F 2, BC 1 and BC 2 of six crosses were evaluated during Zaid and Kharif 2008. Experiments were conducted to estimate selection parameters i.e. heritability in broad sense and genetic advance as per cent of mean among the six cross families. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance (>20%) were recorded for plant height (cross I, II and V), number of clusters per plant (cross II and III), number of seeds per pod (cross VI), 100-seed weight (cross II and V), harvest index (cross I, II, V and VI), seed yield per plant (in all crosses) and protein content in (cross V and VI) during Kharif. However, in Zaid it was observed for plant height (cross II), number of pods per plant (cross IV), pod seed ratio (cross II), 100-seed weight (cross II), biological yield per plant (cross III, IV and V), harvest index (cross II and III) seed yield per plant (cross I, II, III and VI) and protein content (cross V and VI).#FRE#
