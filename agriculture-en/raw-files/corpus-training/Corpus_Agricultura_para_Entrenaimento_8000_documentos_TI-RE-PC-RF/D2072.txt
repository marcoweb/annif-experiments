#ITI#Association of soil-test phosphorus with phosphorus fractions and adsorption characteristics#FTI#
#IRE#There is incomplete understanding, based on a single comprehensive study, of the relationship between empirical extractants of soil-test P (STP) and fundamental measurements of soil-P status such as inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) fractions, P adsorption and relevant ancillary soil attributes. Consequently, we assessed these relationships for the extractants Morgan, Mehlich-3, Olsen, Bray-1, lactate-acetate, CaCl2 (1:2 and 1:10 soil:solution) and resin. Multiple regression analysis indicated that STP extracted with Morgan and CaCl2 related dominantly with the most labile resin Pi fraction, Mehlich-3 and Olsen with labile NaHCO3 Pi, Bray-1 with moderately labile NaOH Pi and lactate-acetate with relatively stable Ca-bound HCl Pi, for example. Especially for Morgan and CaCl2 (1:2), and except for Bray-1, the best relationship of STP with adsorption characteristics was with equilibrium P concentration in solution (EPC). Buffering capacity (EBC) and binding energy (k) did not have significant effects, as indicated by regression, whereas the effects of clay and oxalate-extractable Fe (Feox) were generally negative and Al ox and organic carbon (OC) positive. Principal component analysis (PCA) highlighted many similarities in the extractants. However, regression of STP against soil-P pools, integrated as principal component scores, inadequately revealed relationships, which were better facilitated by PCA ordinations. For ordinations of STP with P fractions, eigenvalues for the first two axes explained 88.6% of the variance. Closest associations were residual Pi with HCl Pi, CaCl2 (1:10) and to a lesser extent Morgan with OC and clay, and Mehlich-3 and Olsen with NaHCO3 Pi and resin Pi. For ordinations of STP with P adsorption, eigenvalues for the first two axes explained 97.8% of the variance. The STP extractants grouped in specific, but distinctly different, combinations. For example, strongest inverse relationships were EBC to EPC and Morgan, and k to resin and Olsen, and to OC and clay, indicative of weak P bonding on these surfaces. These distinctions are consistent with, and provide a rationale for, the relevance of Morgan as an environmental P test vis-a-vis other extractants of STP. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.#FRE#
