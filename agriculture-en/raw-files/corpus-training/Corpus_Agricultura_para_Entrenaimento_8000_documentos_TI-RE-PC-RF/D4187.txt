#ITI#Application of a new Bivalent Marek's disease vaccine does not interfere with infectious bronchitis or newcastle disease vaccinations and proves efficacious#FTI#
#IRE#A possible interference after Marek's disease (MD) vaccination using an experimental bivalent vaccine, consisting of a redesigned CVI-988/Rispens-type MDV-1 strain and herpesvirus of turkeys, with vaccination against infectious bronchitis (IB) virus (IBV) or Newcastle disease (ND) virus (NDV) was examined. Day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks were concomitantly vaccinated with the bivalent MD vaccine (either intramuscularly or subcutaneously) and with commercially available vaccines against ND or IB. Afterward chickens were challenged with either lethal MD virus (MDV) or NDV strains or with a pathogenic IBV strain. After challenge, neither mortality nor notable clinical signs of MD, ND, or IB were observed in the vaccinated birds. The experimental bivalent MDV vaccine proved efficacious against lethal MDV challenge and did not affect the efficacy of the NDV or IBV vaccines. In conclusion, no signs of interference or adverse effects were detected. Thus, the vaccines can be administered concomitantly on chickens' first day of life.
