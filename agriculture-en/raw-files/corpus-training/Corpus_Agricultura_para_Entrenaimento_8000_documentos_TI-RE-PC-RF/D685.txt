#ITI#Tuber transcriptome analysis reveals a novel WRKY transcription factor StWRKY70 potentially involved in potato pigmentation#FTI#
#IRE#Tuber flesh pigmentation, conferred by the presence of secondary metabolite anthocyanins, is one of many key agronomic traits for potato tubers. Although several genes of potato anthocyanin biosynthesis have been reported, transcription factors (TFs) contributing to tuber flesh pigmentation are still not fully understood. In this study, transcriptomic profiling of diploid potato accessions with or without tuber flesh pigmentation was conducted and genes of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway were found significantly enriched within the 1435 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and connectivity analysis pinpointed a subset of 173 genes closely related to the key biosynthetic gene StDFR. Of the eight transcription factors in the subset, group III WRKY StWRKY70, was chosen for showing high connectivity to StDFR and ten other anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and homology to known WRKYs of anthocyanin pathway. The transient activation assay showed StWRKY70 predominantly stimulated the expression of StDFR and StANS as well as the accumulation of anthocyanins by enhancing the function of the MYB transcription factor StAN1. Furthermore, the interaction between StWRKY70 and StAN1 was verified by Y2H and BiFC. Our analysis discovered a new transcriptional activator StWRKY70 which potentially involved in tuber flesh pigmentation, thus may lay the foundation for deciphering how the WRKY-MYB-bHLH-WD40 (WRKY-MBW) complex regulate the accumulation of anthocyanins and provide new strategies to breed for more nutritious potato varieties with enhanced tuber flesh anthocyanins. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
