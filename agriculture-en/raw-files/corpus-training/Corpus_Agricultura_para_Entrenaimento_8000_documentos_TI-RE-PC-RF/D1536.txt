#ITI#Phosphorus, potassium and leucaena pruning interactions on corn in Haiti#FTI#
#IRE#Few P and K fertility studies have been conducted on Haitian soils. Alley cropping is promoted in Haiti but has not been studied in relation to P and K fertility. The effects of P and K fertilizer and leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam) De Witt) pruning mulch applications on corn (Zea mays L.) were assessed in field experiments on Rhodudalfs over limestone at Salagnac, Lithic Hapludolls over limestone at Bergeau and Typic Hapludalfs over basalt at St. Georges, Haiti. Complete block designs arranged in incomplete factorials of P and K rates were carried out during three seasons. Additional treatments consisted of 30 Mg ha-1 of leucaena prunings applied with and without 60 kg P and 40 kg K ha-1. Grain yield and net income were analyzed and a surface response curve was fitted on treatments without pruning applications. The soils differed markedly in response to P and K with significant PXK interactions. Without leucaena prunings, response surface analysis predicted maximum yields with applications of 95-117 kg P ha-1 and 51-72 kg K ha-1 and maximum net returns with applications of 0.22-89 kg P ha-1 and 43-79 kg K ha-1. Leucaena pruning applications increased yield at all sites. Highest net income was obtained at Salagnac and St. Georges with leucaena prunings applied with P and K, at Bergeau with prunings applied without P and K, suggesting that alley cropping with judicial fertilizer use is a good economic alternative for low resource farmers. Soil parent material and mineralogy should be considered in making fertilizer recommendations. © Springer 2005.#FRE#
