#ITI#Stimulation of Soybean (Glycine max) Growth and Yield using Bradyrhizobium Inoculants in the Semi-arid Environment of Botswana#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Crop yields in the semi-arid regions are low due to climatic and soil related constraints. Soybean as one of the most important legume crops grown worldwide, has a role to contribute nitrogen to improve nutrient poor soils in Africa. A study was conducted to examine the effects of Bradyrhizobium spp inoculations on the growth and yield of soybean varieties in a glasshouse. Methods: The study was arranged in a randomized complete block factorial design, with factor A being two soybean varieties (Bimha and Status) while factor B was inoculation using four Bradyrhizobium strains and the uninoculated control. Result: Bradyrhizobium inoculation significantly (P<0.001) affected days to 50% flowering, days to emergence, nodule number, root dry weight and grain yield and yield traits. Parameters that were affected by both inoculant strain and variety included days to 50% flowering, days to emergence, number of pods per plant, pod weight and number of seeds per pod. The interaction effect of variety and Bradyrhizobium inoculant strain was observed only on number of pods per plants. Our study shows that soybean grows well when inoculated with Bradyrhizobium inoculants, in semi-arid conditions of Botswana. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
