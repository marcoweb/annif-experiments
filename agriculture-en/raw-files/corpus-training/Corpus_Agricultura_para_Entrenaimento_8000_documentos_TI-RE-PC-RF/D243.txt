#IRE#Adaptation of plants to environmental changes involves the mechanisms of long-distance signaling. In characean algae, these mechanisms comprise the propagation of action potential (AP) and the rotational cytoplasmic streaming acting in cooperation with light-dependent exchange of ions and metabolites across the chloroplast envelope. Both excitability and cyclosis exert conspicuous effects on photosynthetic activity of chloroplasts but possible influence of cyclosis arrest on the coupling of AP stimulus to photosynthetic performance remained unexplored. In this study, fluidic interactions between anchored chloroplasts were allowed or restricted by illuminating the whole internode or a confined cell area (2 mm in diameter), respectively. Measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (F′ and Fm’) in cell regions located close to calcium crystal depositions revealed that the AP generation induced long-lasting Fm’ oscillations that persisted in illuminated cells. The AP generation often induced the F′ oscillations, whose number diminished upon the transfer of internodal cells from total to local background light. The results indicate that the AP-induced changes in photosynthetic parameters, F’ in particular, have a complex origin and comprise the internal processes caused by the elevation of stromal Ca2+ concentration in the analyzed chloroplasts and the stages related to ion and metabolite exchange mediated by cytoplasmic streaming. It is supposed that the composition of flowing cytoplasm is heterogeneous due to the spatial alteration of calcified and noncalcified cell sites, but this heterogeneity is enhanced and can be visualized after the transient cessation and restoration of cytoplasmic streaming. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
