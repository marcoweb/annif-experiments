#ITI#Rice–wheat productivity and profitability with residue, tillage and green manure management#FTI#
#IRE#                             The rice–wheat system (RWS) practiced in northwestern parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains of India is highly productive, but conventional practices are resource (water, labour and energy) and cost intensive. A 4-year field study evaluated the effects of green manure (GM), crop residue and tillage on crop yields, economic profitability and soil fertility in a RWS. Four main plot treatments in rice included combinations of wheat stubble and Sesbania aculeata GM management: (1) puddled transplanted rice (PTR) with no wheat stubble, (2) PTR with 25% wheat stubbles (15–20 cm high) retained, (3) PTR with no wheat stubble plus GM, and (4) PTR with wheat stubble splus GM. Three sub-plots treatments in subsequent wheat included (1) conventional till wheat with rice straw removed (CTW                             R0                             ), (2) zero till wheat with rice straw removed (ZTW                             R0                             ) and (3) zero till wheat with 100% rice straw retained as surface mulch (ZTW                             R100                             ). The results showed that main rice yield was significantly higher (8.0%) with 50% less fertilizer N application in GM compared with conventional PTR with no GM. Rice treatments did not affect the grain yield of subsequent wheat. ZTW                             R100                              produced significantly higher mean wheat grain yield by 7.3% and 17.5% compared with CTW                             R0                              and ZTW                             R0                             , respectively. System productivity was 11.5% higher in PTR with wheat stubble + GM followed by ZTW                             R100                              compared with the conventional RWS and resulted in Rs 24,075 ha                             −1                              more net returns. Significant increases in soil organic carbon, available P and available K contents were recorded in ZTW                             R100                              over CTW                             R0                             . Recycling rice and wheat stubble in the field in RWS is also environment friendly as it avoids ill effects of straw burning.                          © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
