#ITI#Influence of seed inoculation with commercial bacterial inoculants (Bradyrhizobium japonicum) on growth and yield of soybean#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was carried out with three bacterial inoculants: HiStick® Soy, Nitragina, Nitrazon and the control. Number and dry weight of nodules were significantly higher with inoculation of bacterial inoculants compared to the control. In 2017, the most pods per plant were obtained after the use of Nitrazon or HiStick® Soy, while in 2018, after the use of HiStick® Soy or Nitragina. In 2018, the highest 1000 seed weight was obtained after the use of Nitragina. In 2017, the seed yield was the most favourably affected by the inoculants HiStick®Soy (3.31 t ha-1) and Nitrazon (3.37 t ha-1) and in 2018, by HiStick® Soy (3.92 t ha-1) and Nitragina (3.87 t ha-1). High Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) readings, were observed with HiStick® Soy. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
