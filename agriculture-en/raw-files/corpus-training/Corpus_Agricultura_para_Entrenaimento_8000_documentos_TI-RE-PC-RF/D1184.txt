#ITI#Ghosts of dry seasons past: Legacy of severe drought enhances mangrove salinity tolerance through coordinated cellular osmotic and elastic adjustments#FTI#
#IRE#The incidence and severity of global mangrove mortality due to drought is increasing. Yet, little is understood of the capacity of mangroves to show long-term acclimation of leaf water relations to severe drought. We tested for differences between mid-dry season leaf water relations in two cooccurring mangroves, Aegiceras corniculatum and Rhizophora stylosa before a severe drought (a heatwave combined with low rainfall) and after its relief by the wet season. Consistent with ecological stress memory, the legacy of severe drought enhanced salinity tolerance in the subsequent dry season through coordinated adjustments that reduced the leaf water potential at the turgor loss point and increased cell wall rigidity. These adjustments enabled maintenance of turgor and relative water content with increasing salinity. As most canopy growth occurs during the wet season, acclimation to the ‘memory’ of higher salinity in the previous dry season enables greater leaf function with minimal adjustments, as long-lived leaves progress from wet through dry seasons. However, declining turgor safety margins - the difference between soil water potential and leaf water potential at turgor loss - implied increasing limitation to water use with increasing salinity. Thus, plasticity in leaf water relations contributes fundamentally to mangrove function under varying salinity regimes. © 2023 The Authors.
