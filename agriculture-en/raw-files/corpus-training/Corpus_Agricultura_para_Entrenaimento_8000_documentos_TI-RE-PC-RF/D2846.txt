#ITI#Impact of Front Line Demonstrations of chickpea in Gujarat#FTI#
#IRE#Three hundred Front Line Demonstrations on chickpea were conducted on different aspects during 2000-01 to 2009-10. The yield gap between conventional practices and improved package of practices was much higher ranging from 21 kg/ha to 349 kg/ha. There is urgent need to make stronger extension services for educating the cultivators in the implementation of improved technology. Under varietal demonstration, the technology gap was much higher i.e. 349 kg/ha followed by management of fertilizers in chickpea (191 kg/ha).#FRE#
