#ITI#Rates and controls on denitrification in an agricultural soil fertilized with liquid lagoonal swine waste#FTI#
#IRE#Under laboratory conditions, we studied rates and controls on denitrification and denitrification potential (denitrifying enzyme activity, DEA) in agricultural soils in the southeastern United States that had been repeatedly fertilized with liquid lagoonal swine effluent. This is a waste management practice commonly employed by large-scale swine production facilities that have proliferated regionally in the past 10 years. The microbial community was rapidly responsive to the added waste, as denitrification N flux (N 2 + N2O) from intact soil cores increased from about 200 to as high as 2850 μg N m-2 h-1, usually within 1 day of application. Elevated rates of denitrification were short-lived (≤ 3 days), as the combination of coarse soil texture (rapid drainage) and low mineralization potential (low organic content) of the waste rapidly restored aerobic conditions. Although <2% of the fertilizer-N was lost to denitrification by the time rates had returned to pre-fertilization values after 8-12 days, soil NO3 --N levels increased from ≤ 5 μg N gdw soil-1 to as high as 43 μg N gdw soil-1, providing not only substrate for additional denitrification following rainfall, but also a mobile N source for both offsite transport by surface and groundwater and assimilation by plants. Both N2O and N2 production from denitrification were unresponsive to changes in soil moisture until field capacity was approached or exceeded. Temperature coefficients (Q 10) for DEA varied from 1.6 to 2.8 between 7 and 30°C, depending on the temperature interval, while high DEA between 20 and 40°C pointed to a denitrifying community well-adapted to regional summer soil temperatures. Glucose-C or NO3 --N amendments proved equally stimulatory to DEA in homogenized soils relative to water-only controls. However, addition of the combined substrates gave the best response, indicating that these chemical factors were equally important controls on potential denitrification in these soils once anaerobic conditions had become established. © Springer 2005.#FRE#
