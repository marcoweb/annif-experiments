#ITI#Physico-chemical, engineering and functional properties of two soybean cultivars#FTI#
#IRE#Information on the physico-chemical, engineering and functional properties of soybean is pertinent to design equipment for the grading, pretreatments and processing. It will also help to decide the right end-use of the valuable crop as it has various diverse applications. This study evaluated these properties of two popular cultivars of soybean grown in Punjab, India viz. SL-744 and SL-958 and the investigations revealed that the grains of SL-958 are bolder and heavier than SL-744 with lighter color, greater hydration capacity, swelling capacity and volume making it more suitable for applications which require soaking and heat processing. SL-744 exhibits higher water absorption and oil absorption capacities as well as foaming capacity hence it can be used in baking industry where these properties are desirable for improving the texture, consistency and flavor of the prepared products. © 2019; Agricultural Research Communication Centre, All rights reserved.#FRE#
