#IRE#Acacia mangium Willd. is one of the major tree species used in plantation forestry programs throughout Asia and the Pacific. The tree legume is prone to various seedling and foliage diseases found in nurseries and while in nurseries. This paper reports the incidence of powdery mildew caused by Oidium sp. on seedlings of A. mangium, maintained in root trainers and nursery seed beds of the Rain Forest Research Institute situated in Jorhat, Assam (India). This is the first report of powdery mildew on A. mangium from India.#FRE#
