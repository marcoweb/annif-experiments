#ITI#Effect of water management practice on pesticide behavior in paddy water#FTI#
#IRE#The fate and transport of three herbicides commonly used in rice production in Japan were compared using two water management practices. The herbicides were simetryn, thiobencarb and mefenacet. The first management practice was an intermittent irrigation scheme using an automatic irrigation system (AI) with a high drainage gate and the second one was a continuous irrigation and overflow drainage scheme (CI) in experimental paddy fields. Dissipation of the herbicides appeared to follow first order kinetics with the half-lives (DT50) of 1.6-3.4 days and the DT90 (90% dissipation) of 7.4-9.8 days. The AI scheme had little drainage even during large rainfall events thus resulting in losses of less than 4% of each applied herbicide through runoff. Meanwhile the CI scheme resulted in losses of about 37%, 12% and 35% of the applied masses of simetryn, thiobencarb and mefenacet, respectively. The intermittent irrigation scheme using an automatic irrigation system with a high drainage gate saved irrigation water and prevented herbicide runoff whereas the continuous irrigation and overflow scheme resulted in significant losses of water as well as the herbicides. Maintaining the excess water storage is important for preventing paddy water runoff during significant rainfall events. The organic carbon partition coefficient Koc seems to be a strong indicator of the aquatic fate of the herbicide as compared to the water solubility (SW). However, further investigations are required to understand the relation between Koc and the agricultural practices upon the pesticide fate and transport. An extension of the water holding period up to 10 days after herbicide application based on the DT90 from the currently specified period of 3-4 days in Japan is recommended to be a good agricultural practice for controlling the herbicide runoff from paddy fields. Also, the best water management practice, which can be recommended for use during the water holding period, is the intermittent irrigation scheme using an automatic irrigation system with a high drainage gate.
