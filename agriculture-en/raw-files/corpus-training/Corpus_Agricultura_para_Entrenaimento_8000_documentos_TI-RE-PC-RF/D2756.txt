#ITI#Genetic architecture of radiation induced variability for quantitative traits in chickpea (CICER arietinum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#Seed samples of two varieties of chickpea namely HPG-17and Himachal chana-1 were irradiated with 30kR, 40kR, 50kR doses of gamma - rays to induce variability for yield and related traits. Significant shift in mean values for quantitative traits was observed in M 2 and M 3 generations. Genetic parameters were higher for seed yield and related traits in M 3 generation of HPG-17 and M 2 generation of Himachal chana-1. The magnitude of parameters of variability was more in 30kR treated population of HPG-17 and 40kR treated population of Himachal chana-1. High heritability coupled with high genetic advance observed for plant height, biological yield and seed yield per plant in HPG-17 and for pod bearing branches per plant in Himachal chana-1, indicate that these traits are likely to respond effectively to phenotypic selection. Significant positive additive and dominance effects were observed for majority of traits studied in 40kR and 50kR treated populations of HPG-17 and for 30kR and 40kR treated populations of Himachal chana-1.#FRE#
