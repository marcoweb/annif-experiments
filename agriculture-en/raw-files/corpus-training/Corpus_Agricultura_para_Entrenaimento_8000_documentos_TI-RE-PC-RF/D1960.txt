#ITI#Phosphorous stock changes in agricultural soils: a case study in Turkey#FTI#
#IRE#Given that phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable and finite resource, there is an increasing need to sustainably use P in agriculture. To this end, accurately assessing P budgets in agricultural soils is critical. On one hand P deficiency negatively affects plant and animal growth, while on the other hand P surplus can cause significant problems that affect water quality (e.g. eutrophication and low oxygen level). The method to estimate the Phosphorus Budget as proposed by Eurostat and the OECD was developed under the assumption of zero changes in soil P stock (SSC-P), due to the lack of available data. However, studies have shown that SSC-P cannot be neglected to assess P efficiency properly. In this study, an approach is proposed that allows estimating SSC-P, as well as related indicators. The largest uncertainty in the method derives from the lack of evidence on the maximum achievable Phosphorus Use Efficiency (PUEmax). The national and regional P budgets of agriculture in Turkey were estimated using the improved methodology at the level of administrative regions for the period 2007–2011. Results give a range of regional SSC-P of −4.8 and 3.9 kg P ha−1 year−1 with a mean national SSC-P of −0.3 kg P ha−1 year−1 (assuming a PUEmax of 100 %). However, the average SSC-P for Turkey could be as large as −1.4 kg P ha−1 year−1 for a PUEmax of 80 %. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
