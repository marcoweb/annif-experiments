#ITI#Olive mill wastewater management in river basins: A case study in Greece#FTI#
#IRE#Olive mill wastewater (OMW) constitutes an important environmental pollution problem, especially in the Mediterranean, the main olive oil production region in the world. The aim of this study is to evaluate the management techniques currently in use in a river basin polluted by OMW, and to present centralised and decentralised generic scenarios plans. In both cases, Geographical Information Systems indicate the most appropriate technologies to be used. These plans can be applied to river basins, where various parameters can be determined.
