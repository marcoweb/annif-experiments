#ITI#Agromorphological characterisation and preliminary evaluation of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) conserved on farms in León province (Spain)#FTI#
#IRE#Chickpea is a traditional crop in the province of León (north-west Spain), where there are a wide range of cultivated varieties which are considered heterogeneous mixtures of genotypes. The aim of this research was to conduct a morphological and agricultural assessment of 119 chickpea ecotypes. The study was carried out in 2009 and 2010, using chickpeas collected in 2008 from traditional farms in the province of León. The results obtained showed differences in growth habit and plant height, as well as in seed characteristics and in yields. This preliminary assessment has enabled us to select 9 ecotypes presenting exceptional yield, aptitude for mechanisation and/or grain characteristics.#FRE#
