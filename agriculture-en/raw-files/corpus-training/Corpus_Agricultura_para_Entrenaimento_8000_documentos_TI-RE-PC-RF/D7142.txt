#ITI#Water production functions of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) irrigated with saline and alkali waters using double-line source sprinkler system#FTI#
#IRE#Expected yield losses as a function of quality and quantity of water applied for irrigation are required to formulate guidelines for the effective utilisation of marginal quality waters. In an experiment conducted during 2004-2006, double-line source sprinklers were used to determine the separate and interactive effects of saline and alkali irrigation waters on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The study included three water qualities: groundwater (GW; electrical conductivity of water, ECw 3.5 dS m-1; sodium adsorption ratio, SAR 9.8 mmol L-1; residual sodium carbonate, RSC, nil) available at the site, and two synthesized waters, saline (SW; ECw 9.4 dS m-1, SAR 10.3 mmol L-1; RSC nil) and alkali (AW; ECw 3.7 dS m-1, SAR 15.1 mmol L-1; RSC 9.6 meq. L-1). The depths of applied SW, AW, and GW per irrigation ranged from 0.7 to 3.5 cm; the depths of applied mixtures of GW with either SW (MSW) or AW (MAW) ranged from 3.2 to 5 cm. Thereby, the water applied for post-plant irrigations using either of GW, SW or AW ranged between 15.2 and 34.6 cm and 17.1 and 48.1 cm during 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, respectively and the range was 32.1-37.0 and 53.1-60.0 cm for MSW or MAW. Grain yields, when averaged for two years, ranged between 3.08 and 4.36 Mg ha-1, 2.57 and 3.70 Mg ha-1 and 2.73 and 3.74 Mg ha-1 with various quantities of water applied using GW, SW and AW, respectively, and between 3.47 and 3.75 Mg ha-1 and 3.63 and 3.77 Mg ha-1 for MSW and MAW, respectively. The water production functions developed for the two sets of water quality treatments could be represented as: RY = 0.528 + 0.843(WA/OPE) - 0.359(WA/OPE)2 - 0.027ECw + 0.44 × 10-2(WA/OPE) × ECw for SW (R2 = 0.63); RY = 0.446 + 0.816(OPE/WA) - 0.326(WA/OPE)2 - 0.0124RSC - 0.55 × 10-4(WA/OPE) × RSC for AW (R2 = 0.56). Here, RY, WA and OPE are the relative yields in reference to the maximum yield obtained with GW, water applied for pre- and post-plant irrigations (cm), and open pan evaporation, respectively. Crop yield increased with increasing amount of applied water for all of the irrigation waters but the maximum yields as obtained with GW, could not be attained even with increased quantities of SW and AW. Increased frequency of irrigation with sprinklers reduced the rate of yield decline with increasing salinity in irrigation water. The sodium contents of plants increased with salinity/alkalinity of sprinkled waters as also with their quantities. Simultaneous decrease in potassium contents resulted in remarkable increase in Na:K ratio. © 2009.#FRE#
