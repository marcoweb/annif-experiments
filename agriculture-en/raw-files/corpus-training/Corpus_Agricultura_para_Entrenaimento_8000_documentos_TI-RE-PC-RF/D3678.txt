#ITI#Antifungal activity of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde isolated from decalepis hamiltonii (Wight & Arn.) on seed-borne fungi causing biodeterioration of paddy#FTI#
#IRE#In vitro antifungal activity assay of different concentrations of 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde isolated from Decalepis hamiltonii against six important seed-borne fungal pathogens viz., Alternaria alternata, Drechslera tetramera, Fusarium oxysporum, F. proliferatum, Pyricularia oryzae and Trichoconis padwickii isolated from paddy seeds revealed that, the compound 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde showed significant antifungal activity. Among the fungi tested, F. proliferatum showed highest inhibitory activity, whereas P. oryzae showed least inhibitory activity. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) varied between 350 μg/ml and 650 μg/ml depending on the fungal species. Comparative evaluation of the active compound with the synthetic fungicide thiram at recommended dosage revealed that, the antifungal activity of the active compound obtained from the plant was almost equivalent. Evaluation for nutritional parameters and dry matter losses (DML) revealed that, total carbohydrates, water soluble proteins, lipids and dry matter losses were significantly confined in 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde treated paddy seeds compared with control seeds. This plant being an edible one can be exploited in the management of seed-borne pathogenic fungi and in the prevention of biodeterioration of grains and mycotoxin production during storage in an eco-friendly way.#FRE#
