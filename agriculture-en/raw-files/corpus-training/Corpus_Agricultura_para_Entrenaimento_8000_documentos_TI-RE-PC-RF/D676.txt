#ITI#An indole-3-acetic acid inhibitor mitigated mild cadmium stress by suppressing peroxide formation in rice seedling roots#FTI#
#IRE#Cadmium (Cd) is a widely distributed heavy metal pollutant that is detrimental to growth and development of plants. The secretion of indole-3-acetic acid is one of the defense mechanisms when plants inflict heavy metal stress. This study aimed to explore how 4-phenoxyphenylboronic acid, an effective IAA inhibitor, induces changes in IAA level, Cadmium accumulation, and activation of defense responses in rice seedling roots under different Cadmium concentrations. Our research results show that: 1) root growth was promoted with PPBa addition under mild Cadmium treatment. 2) the root IAA level improved with increasing Cadmium concentration, and PPBa had a significant inhibitory effect on IAA level. 3) PPBa had no effect on the Cadmium accumulation in rice seedling roots. 4) PPBa had a significant inhibitory effect on the generation of H2O2 under mild and moderate Cadmium treatment. 5) PPBa exacerbated the imbalance of osmotic substances in rice seedling roots under severe Cadmium treatment. This study helps us understand the tolerance and endogenous regulation of plants to heavy metal stress. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
