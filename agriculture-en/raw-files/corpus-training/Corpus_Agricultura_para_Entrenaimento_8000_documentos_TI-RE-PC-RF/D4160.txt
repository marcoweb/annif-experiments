#ITI#Species determination of fowl adenoviruses based on the 52K gene region#FTI#
#IRE#In the present study, the classification of fowl adenoviruses (FAdVs) based on a part of the 52K gene region was described. A total of 44 FAdV field samples from different countries and sources were detected using a recently developed SYBR Green-based real-time PCR. Amplified products were sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses were conducted on the basis of the 116-bp region. For comparison, the already published sequences of the 52K gene region of aviadenoviruses were used in the analyses. The phylogenetic analysis allowed the grouping of the FAdVs into the established five different FAdV species: Fowl adenovirus A to Fowl adenovirus E. The existence of the species was supported by high bootstrap values (>70%). This method provides the advantages of quantitation and high sensitivity for FAdV detection in combination with species assignment. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
