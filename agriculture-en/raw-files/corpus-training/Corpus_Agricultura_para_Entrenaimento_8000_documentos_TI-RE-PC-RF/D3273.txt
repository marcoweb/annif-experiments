#ITI#Seed hardening, foliar spraying and their combined effect on dry matter partitioning in green gram (Vigna radiata l.)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Mung bean is important pulse crop having low productivity. Considering the constraints, it is worthwhile to study the influence of different seed hardening and foliar spraying treatments on the production potential of mung bean. Methods: Mung bean var. GAM-5 was imposed with seed hardening treatments and also for foliar spray using CaCl2 2% & 1%, CCC 500 mg/L, CCC 1000 mg/L, NAA 25 mg/L, NAA 50 mg/L during summer season of 2015-16 and 2016-17. These treatments were evaluated for their dry matter partitioning at field conditions. Result: The leaf dry matter decreased in all the treatments after 60 DAS at the time of pod development upto harvest. There was a very less rate of increase in the stem and root dry matter from pod development stage till the harvest leading to an increase in pod weight. The translocation process must have been more prominent in the treatment CaCl2 2% seed hardening + 1% spraying at 30 DAS (T11) than rest of the treatments and was less in untreated control treatment indicating that photosynthesis and translocation efficiency increases by seed hardening and foliar spraying treatments with agrochemical and growth regulators for increasing the pod yield. Therefore, the treatment T11 was more efficient in dry matter production and its partitioning in leaves, stem, root and pods by allocating maximum dry matter to the pods.
