#ITI#Water stress induced proline accumulation and antioxidative enzymes in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea l.)#FTI#
#IRE#Thirty days grown seedlings of eight genotypes of groundnut viz. RHRG-6083, TAG-24, TG-60(LC), Karad-4-11, SB-XI, RHRG-6097, RHRG-6021, and RHRG-6055 were subjected to moisture stress by withholding irrigation for 15 days in pot culture experiment in order to evaluate its effect of on RWC, proline accumulation, soluble proteins, chlorophyll content and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), glutathione reductase (GR) and lipid peroxidation (MDA).The levels of proline, soluble protein and the activity of all four antioxidative enzymes were found to be increased with MDA content in all genotypes of groundnut during water stress, however the chlorophyll and RWC content were found to be decreased. This study revealed that under water stress condition SB-XI, TAG-24 and RHRG-6021 showed higher increase of proline content and activities of antioxidative enzymes with lower reduction in RWC and chlorophyll. These three genotypes are stable during stress and seems to be promising for drought tolerance. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
