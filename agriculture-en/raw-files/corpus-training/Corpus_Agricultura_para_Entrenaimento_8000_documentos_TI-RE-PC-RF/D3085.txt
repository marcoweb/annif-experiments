#ITI#Effect of Nitrogen and Phosphorus Fertilizers on Growth, Yield, Nodulation and Nutritional Composition of Bambara Groundnut [Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.]#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Bambara groundnut is an edible legume that is highly nutritious. This study was carried out to find the effect of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizers on the growth, yield, nodulation, the proximate and nutritional composition of bambara groundnut [Vigna subterranea (L.) Verdc.]. Methods: During the period of 2018, a glasshouse experiment was conducted in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) at Ladang 15, Faculty of Agriculture, Universiti Putra Malaysia. Different rates of N and P fertilizer were used. Kjeldahl method and HPLC, respectively, determined the protein and amino acid content in seed. Result: N and P fertilizer were found to play a dominating role in increasing the vegetative growth and yield of the plant. Plant height (20.65a), pod number (45.75a) and harvest index (41.61a) increased significantly with the application of N30 + P60 kg ha-1. Application of N30P60 kg ha-1 significantly influenced nodulation and nitrogen yield. Protein, fibre, Mg and amino acid content increased with N30P60 kg ha-1. The application of N30P60 mg kg-1 has increased the growth, yield, nodulation, proximate and nutritional composition of bambara groundnut. Â© 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
