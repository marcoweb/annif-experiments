#ITI#Nitric oxide enhances salt tolerance through regulating antioxidant enzyme activity and nutrient uptake in pea#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Salinity is one of the environmental stress factors that restrict the crop production by endangering agricultural areas. Nitric oxide (NO) protects plants from damage caused by oxidative stress conditions in various biological ways. Methods: In this greenhouse investigation during 2018, pea plants were irrigated with three levels of NaCl (0, 50 and 100 mM) solutions. NO solutions were prepared with three different doses (0, 75 and 100 µM SNP). These solutions were applied to the seeds before sowing and then to the leaves of the pea cultivars. The study was conducted to analyze the impact of NO on growth, malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2), antioxidant enzyme activity and nutrient uptake in two pea cultivars under salinity conditions. Result: Salinity reduced fresh-dry weight, relative water content (RWC) and chlorophyll a and b content of pea. However, NO enhanced these parameters under salt stress. Salinity increased tissue electrical conductance (TEC), H2 O2 and MDA content, which were decreased by combined application of NaCl and NO. Salinity caused an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity in pea, and NO made a significant improvement in their activities under salinity conditions. Salinity treatments decreased the ratio of K+/Na+ and Ca2+/Na+ in both cultivars and application of NO elevated them as compared to the control under salt stress. In conclude, exogenous NO treatment could help pea to tolerate salinity stress by increasing the chlorophyll content and regulating antioxidant enzyme activity and nutrient uptake. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
