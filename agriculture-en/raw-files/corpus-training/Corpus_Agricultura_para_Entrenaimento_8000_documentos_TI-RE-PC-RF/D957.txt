#ITI#Interspecific grafting promotes poplar growth and drought resistance via regulating phytohormone signaling and secondary metabolic pathways#FTI#
#IRE#Populus cathayana (C) grafted onto P. deltoides (D) (C/D) can promote growth better than self-grafting (C/C and D/D). However, the mechanisms underlying growth and resistance to drought stress are not clear. In this study, we performed physiological and RNA-seq analysis on the different grafted combinations. It was found that C/D plants exhibited higher growth, net photosynthetic rate, IAA content and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) than C/C and D/D plants under both well-watered and drought-stressed conditions. However, most growth, photosynthetic indices, and IAA content were decreased less in C/D, whereas ABA content, WUEi and root characteristics (e.g., root length, volume, surface area and vitality) were increased more in C/D than in other grafting combinations under drought-stressed conditions. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in leaves of C/D vs C/C (control, 181; drought, 121) was much lower than that in the roots of C/D vs D/D (control, 1639; drought, 1706), indicating that the rootstocks were more responsive to drought resistance. KEGG and GO functional enrichment analysis showed that the enhanced growth and drought resistance of C/D were mainly related to DEGs involved in the pathways of ABA and IAA signaling, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, especially the pathways for lignin and dopamine synthesis and metabolism. Therefore, our results further demonstrated the dominant role of rootstock in drought resistance, and enriched our knowledge on the mechanism of how interspecific grafting enhanced the growth and drought resistance in poplar.
