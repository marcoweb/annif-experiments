#ITI#Yield performance and content of selected organic compounds in Trifolium pratense treated with various biostimulants against the background of nitrogen fertilisation#FTI#
#IRE#The present work is an attempt to assess the effect of biostimulants of various origins and nitrogen regime on yield performance, chlorophyll content, protein content and soluble carbohydrate in red clover. A field experiment was arranged as a randomized subblock design (split-plot) in Poland in August 2013. The following factors were examined: type of biostimulant; nitrogen application rate: 0 (control) and 30 kg. ha-1. Biostimulants significantly increased red clover biomass yields. All the examined biostimulants contributed to an increase in the amount of organic components in red clover dry matter. Nitrogen applied at the rate of 30 kg. ha-1 significantly increased red clover yield, chlorophyll content in red clover leaves and protein compounds but it also significantly reduced soluble carbohydrates in the dry matter of test plants.
