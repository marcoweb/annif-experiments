#ITI#Differentiation of infectious bursal disease viruses isolated in Croatia#FTI#
#IRE#Infectious bursal disease viruses (IBDVs) in 26 IBDV-positive bursa samples collected in Croatia during the period 1996-2000 and in two commercially available vaccines were differentiated by the presence or absence of the CfoI, SacI, SspI, StuI, and TaqI restriction sites in the 422-bp fragment of segment A of the VP2 gene (nt 732-1153). The fragments from 14 (54%) field isolates were TaqI+ StuI+ SspI+ and Sad- CfoI-, indicating their very virulent (w) character. The presence of CfoI restriction site in 10 (38%) field isolates is uncommon for vvIBDV strains. It was detected in only the 88180 vvIBDV strain. Nevertheless, these isolates can be classified as vv strains according to TaqI+ StuI+ SspI+ SacI-restrictions. Two SacI+ StuI+ CfoI+ TaqI- SspI- field isolates (8%) could be classified as non-vvIBDVs. The StuI+ restriction is common to vvIBDV strains. However, the StuI recognition sequence is present in the F52/70 classic European and 002-73 attenuated strains as well. The SacI+ CfoI+ StuI- SspI- restrictions and the lack of the TaqI restriction at nt position 832 show that the IBDV in GUMBOKAL® IM-SPF vaccine corresponds to the attenuated and/or vaccine strains. The TaqI restriction at nt position 875 suggests that the IBDV in GUMBOKAL® SPF vaccine could belong to the mild strains.#FRE#
