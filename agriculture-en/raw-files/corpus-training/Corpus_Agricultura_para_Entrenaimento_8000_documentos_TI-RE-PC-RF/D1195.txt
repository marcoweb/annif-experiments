#ITI#Nitrate accumulation and greenhouse gas emissions during compost storage#FTI#
#IRE#Greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4 and N2O) are emitted during livestock manure handling, including composting, storage and land application. However, published data on emission rates of these gases during storage are sparse. In this study, the levels of GHG emissions and N levels during compost storage were investigated. The compost materials were produced by composting livestock manure for 133 d with 0, 10, 20 and 30% phosphogypsum (PG) or 10, 20 and 30% sand amendment. These compost materials were then stored on a clay pad for 233 d. Results from this study indicated that TN content did not change but mineral N content increased significantly during the 233 d storage for all treatments. The higher mineral N content in compost increases its agronomic value. There were only trace amounts of CH4 and N 2O emissions. The C loss during storage was mainly as CO2 and accounted for about 2.9 to 10% of total C initially in the compost. This information is vital to livestock manure life cycle analysis, and can be used to develop best manure management strategies that reduce GHG emissions from livestock production.
