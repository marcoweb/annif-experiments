#ITI#Variety × nutrient management interaction in greengram for important yield attributes under rainfed red lateritic inceptisol#FTI#
#IRE#                             The effect of five nutrient management practices on the yield and yield attributes, nutrient uptake and rain water use efficiency in four greengram varieties (Dhauli, Pusa-9531, OBGG-52 and Nayagarh Local) in rainfed upland inceptisol with sandy-loam soil was studied in factorial RBD with three replications during Kharif 2009 to 2012. Significant variety × nutrient interaction was observed with respect to seed yield, nodulation and other yield attributing characters. Based on the mean data over four years (2009-2012), highest seed yield of 5.84 q ha                             -1                              was observed in Pusa 9531 with lime+50% organic+ 50% inorganic treatment followed by Dhauli (5.53 q ha                             -1                             ) with the same nutrient treatment. Highest RWUE was found in Lime + 50% organic + 50% inorganic treatment in all the varieties followed by 100% organic treatment in Dhauli, Pusa-9531 and OBGG-52 but in 50% organic + 50% inorganic treatment in case of Nayagarh Local. The uptake of N, P and K was also observed to be the highest in Lime + 50% organic + 50% inorganic treatment in all the varieties.                          © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
