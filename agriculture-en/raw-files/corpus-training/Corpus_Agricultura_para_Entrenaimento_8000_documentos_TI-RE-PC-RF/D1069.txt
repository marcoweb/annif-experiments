#ITI#Dynamics and interplay of photosynthetic regulatory processes depend on the amplitudes of oscillating light#FTI#
#IRE#Plants have evolved multiple regulatory mechanisms to cope with natural light fluctuations. The interplay between these mechanisms leads presumably to the resilience of plants in diverse light patterns. We investigated the energy-dependent nonphotochemical quenching (qE) and cyclic electron transports (CET) in light that oscillated with a 60-s period with three different amplitudes. The photosystem I (PSI) and photosystem II (PSII) function-related quantum yields and redox changes of plastocyanin and ferredoxin were measured in Arabidopsis thaliana wild types and mutants with partial defects in qE or CET. The decrease in quantum yield of qE due to the lack of either PsbS- or violaxanthin de-epoxidase was compensated by an increase in the quantum yield of the constitutive nonphotochemical quenching. The mutant lacking NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH)-like-dependent CET had a transient significant PSI acceptor side limitation during the light rising phase under high amplitude of light oscillations. The mutant lacking PGR5/PGRL1-CET restricted electron flows and failed to induce effective photosynthesis control, regardless of oscillation amplitudes. This suggests that PGR5/PGRL1-CET is important for the regulation of PSI function in various amplitudes of light oscillation, while NDH-like-CET acts' as a safety valve under fluctuating light with high amplitude. The results also bespeak interplays among multiple photosynthetic regulatory mechanisms. © 2024 The Authors. Plant, Cell & Environment published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.#FRE#
