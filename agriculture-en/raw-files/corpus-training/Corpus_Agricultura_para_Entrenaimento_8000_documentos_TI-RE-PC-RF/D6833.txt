#ITI#Characterizing pivot sprinklers using an experimental irrigation machine#FTI#
#IRE#In this work, a Fixed Spray Plate Sprinkler (FSPS) and two Rotating Spray Plate Sprinklers (RSPS) were compared in terms of wetted diameter, wind drift and evaporation losses (WDEL), static water precipitation pattern and dynamic water application profile. An experimental irrigation machine reproducing a pivot section was constructed and used to perform experiments in static and dynamic (linear displacement) modes. Water application from FSPS often resulted in a bi-modal pattern, while RSPS produced bell-shaped or triangular patterns. At a nozzle elevation of 2.4 m and an operating pressure of 140 kPa the wetted diameter was 1.6 m larger for the RSPS than for the FSPS. The differences between the two RSPS amounted to 0.5 m on the average. Reducing the nozzle elevation from 2.4 to 1.0 m resulted in a 2.6 m decrease in the wetted diameter. The use of RSPS may result in reduced surface runoff losses, due to the increased wetted diameter and the reduced peak precipitation rate. WDEL for RSPS were statistically related to wind speed, although no significant differences were found between both types of RSPS or between the two nozzle elevations. According to the experimental results, reducing the nozzle elevation will not result in reduced WDEL, but will increase the chances for runoff. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
