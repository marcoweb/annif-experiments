#ITI#Adaptive function of duodichogamy: Why do chestnut trees have two pollen emission phases?#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Intersexual mating facilitation in flowering plants has been largely underexplored. Duodichogamy is a rare flowering system in which individual plants flower in the sequence male-female-male. We studied the adaptive advantages of this flowering system using chestnuts (Castanea spp., Fagaceae) as models. These insect-pollinated trees produce many unisexual male catkins responsible for a first staminate phase and a few bisexual catkins responsible for a second staminate phase. We hypothesized that duodichogamy increases female mating success by facilitating pollen deposition on stigmas of the rewardless female flowers through their proximity with attractive male flowers responsible for the minor staminate phase. Methods: We monitored insect visits to 11 chestnut trees during the entire flowering period and explored reproductive traits of all known duodichogamous species using published evidence. Results: In chestnuts, insects visited trees more frequently during the first staminate phase but visited female flowers more frequently during the second staminate phase. All 21 animal-pollinated duodichogamous species identified are mass-flowering woody plants at high risk of self-pollination. In 20 of 21 cases, gynoecia (female flower parts) are located close to androecia (male flower parts), typically those responsible for the second minor staminate phase, whereas androecia are often distant from gynoecia. Conclusions: Our results suggest that duodichogamy increases female mating success by facilitating pollen deposition on stigmas by means of the attractiveness of the associated male flowers while effectively limiting self-pollination. © 2023 The Authors.
