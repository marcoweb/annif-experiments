#ITI#Nitrogen concentration in cottonseed as an indicator of N availability#FTI#
#IRE#Research on corn and winter wheat has shown that a critical N concentration in the grain exists above which a yield response to N fertilizer is unlikely. This indicator can be used for post-harvest evaluation of N sufficiency and for mapping N availability in the field, which may be helpful for making future N fertilizer decisions. The purpose of this study was to determine if a critical N concentration in the seed exists for cotton. The study was conducted in the Georgia Coastal Plain during 1998, 1999, and 2001, using a different variety of cotton in each year. In 1998, 12 N fertilizer rates ranging from 38 to 203 kg ha-1 were applied to Delta Pineland 90 at three locations within one field that differed in soil organic matter and clay concentration, and in 1999 and 2001, 6 N fertilizer rates ranging from 22 to 179 kg ha-1 were applied to Stoneville 474 and Delta Pineland 458 in a different field. At all locations, the N concentration in the cottonseed increased linearly with increasing N fertilizer rates. Maximum yields were obtained at less than maximum seed N concentration. Lower seed N concentrations indicated some degree of N deficiency. Based on these results, it appears that a critical N concentration of 35 g kg-1 exists for cottonseeds, above which no yield response to N fertilizer is likely. Information on the spatial distribution of cottonseed N concentrations could therefore help to evaluate the adequacy of N fertilization for cotton, thereby providing a basis for adjustment of N fertilization rates in future crops.#FRE#
