#ITI#Decision support framework for assessment of non-point-source pollution of groundwater in large irrigation projects#FTI#
#IRE#Agriculture is the main non-point polluter of groundwater in irrigated areas as fertilizers and other agrochemicals are the main contaminants in the water that drains out of the root zone to recharge the aquifer. Nitrates from fertilizers, dissolved in percolation losses from rice fields, are the source of pollution considered. The concentration of nitrates in the percolated water depends on the distributed field water and nitrogen balances over the area. Its concentration in the groundwater depends on the total recharge, pollution loading, groundwater flow and solute transport within the aquifer. The development and application of a GIS based decision support framework that integrates field scale models of these processes for assessment of non-point-source pollution of groundwater in canal irrigation project areas is presented. The GIS is used for representing the spatial variations in input data over the area and map the output of the recharge and nitrogen balance models. The latter are used to provide the spatially distributed recharge and pollutant load inputs to the distributed groundwater flow and transport models, respectively. Alternate strategies for water and fertilizer use can be evaluated using this framework to ensure long-term sustainability of productive agriculture in large irrigation projects. The development and application of the framework is illustrated by taking a case study of a large canal irrigation system in India. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.#FRE#
