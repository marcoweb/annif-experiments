#ITI#Effects of Different Doses of Poultry Manure Application on Yield Components and Yield of Different Faba Bean (Vicia faba L.) Varieties#FTI#
#IRE#Background: A study was conducted to determine the effects of different doses of poultry manure application on the yield and some yield components of faba bean crop under ecological conditions of Siirt province, Southern Eastern Anatolian Region of Turkey. Methods: The study was carried out in randomized complete block design with 3 replications. The main plots were varieties and the sub-plots were poultry manure doses. At 15 days prior to sowing, 0 (control), 500, 1000, 1500 kg ha-1 of poultry manure was spread and mixed with a rake. Result: All observed parameters were effected from poultry manure doses. Application of 1000 kg/ha poultry manure was found superior in terms of yield and yield related parameters. Grain yield was highest at 1000 kg/ha poultry manure application in 2017 and 2018, (2119 kg/ha and 2083 kg/ha, respectively). Salkım variety was superior in terms of grain yield and most of the other parameters. Both varieties were yielded higher and most of the parameters were higher in 2017 compared to 2018. As a result of the study, cropping “Salkım” faba bean variety with 1000 kg/ha poultry manure application in South Eastern Anatolia or similar ecologies was proposed for higher grain yields. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
