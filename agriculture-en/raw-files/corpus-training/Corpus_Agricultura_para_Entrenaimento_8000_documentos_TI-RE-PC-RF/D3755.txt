#ITI#Efficacy of some bioinsecticides against bruchidius incarnatus (Boh.) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) infestation during storage#FTI#
#IRE#Potential activities of three essential oils (cumin, clove and mustard) and of microbial agents (Paecilomyces fumosoroseus, Nomuraea rileyi, Lecanicillium (Verticillium) lecanii and their combinations against Bruchidius incarnatus (Boh.) were evaluated. In choice test, mustard and clove oils revealed a strong repellent activity after 7 days (89% and 71%, respectively) against B. incarnatus beetles. Cumin oil showed the lowest repellency (47%). Accumulative mortality of beetles increased gradually with the increase of exposure intervals. Mustard oil treatment gave the highest mortality percentage of 76% after 168 h from treatment followed by clove treatment which amounted to 63% and the lowest percentage of 42.8% was recorded in case of cumin oil. Mustard oil was the most effective in enhancing the potency of P. fumosoroseus and N. rileyi and decreased LC50 of the target insect (100 and 102×10 7, respectively). The persistent effect of formulated mustard oil with either P. fumosoroseus or N. rileyi fungi on foam covering gunny bags displayed several different modes of action, by reducing oviposition and adult emergence (F1) of B. incarnatus. The oviposition was completely inhibited when stored broad bean seeds were treated with mustard oil + P. fumosoroseus during 20, 40 and 60 days of storage. Application of mustard oil combined with P. fumosoroseus on foam covering gunny bags provided promising oviposition deterrency, toxicity and suppressing B. incarnatus infestation, persistence and protecting broad bean seeds from beetles' infestation for 120 days during storage.#FRE#
