#ITI#Structural equation modeling for the estimation of interconnections between the P cycle and soil properties#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this study was used a basic hypothetical structural model with latent variables to analyze the interconnections between the pools of stable P (inorganic P (Pi) and organic P (Po)), labile P (Pi and Po) and available P (Mehlich-1 P) and the pools of organic matter (OM) content and physicochemical properties in tropical soils of differing pedogenesis. We used structural equation modeling for designing models for two groups of soil: (1) mineral soils with low to medium organic matter content and (2) mineral soils with high organic matter content and organic soils. The proposed structural models were consistent with the hypothesis of dependence between the pools of P and organic matter as well as physicochemical properties in tropical soils. In general, stable and labile P pools acted as P sources for the available P pool; furthermore, the strength of these structural relationships was strongly associated with soil organic matter content. Yet the pool of physicochemical properties behaved as a sink of P for the labile P pool, however with a beneficial effect in maintaining the stable P pool. The pools of P and OM are strongly bonded in tropical soils under different pedogenesis. All structural models evidenced that various forms of P in different levels of lability could contribute in keeping the supply of bioavailable P, yet its magnitude would be regulated by P buffer capacity of each soil. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
