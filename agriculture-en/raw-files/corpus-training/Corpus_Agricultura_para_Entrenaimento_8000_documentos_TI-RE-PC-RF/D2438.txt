#ITI#Biochemical changes in naturally aged seeds of soybean genotypes with good and poor storability#FTI#
#IRE#Seed deterioration during storage is associated with various metabolic and chemical alterations that vary among genotypes in soybean. In the present study, five genotypes with good storability viz., kalitur, MACS 1416, EC 18761, CO1 and DSB21 and five genotypes with poor storability viz., JS 71-05, DS 228, MAUS 61, NRC 93 and DSB 24 were selected and evaluated for biochemical changes to identify the best donors for storability. Among the genotypes, all the poor storer genotypes showed faster accumulation of free amino acids, free fatty acids and malondialdehyde content as a result of oxidative stress. Poor storer genotypes also showed the increased lipoxygenase I & II enzymes activity. All the good storer genotypes showed higher anti-oxidative enzymes activity causing slower lipid peroxidation. Among the good storers, kalitur showed favourable biochemical features for storability while MAUS-61 was identified as poor storer exhibiting less favourable biochemical features.
