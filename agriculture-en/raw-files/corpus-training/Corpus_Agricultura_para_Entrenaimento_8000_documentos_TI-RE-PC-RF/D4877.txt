#ITI#Antibody response of chickens to serotype 1, 2, or 3 Marek's disease vaccines based on ELISA with infected cells as antigen#FTI#
#IRE#An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to evaluate the antibody response of commercial White Leghorn chickens to vaccination against Marek's disease (MD) at hatch (day 0) with serotype-1 (Rispens), -2 (SB-1), or -3 (turkey herpesvirus, HVT) vaccine virus and to challenge on day 21 with MD virus. Antigens for the test were whole chicken embryo fibroblast cells infected with Rispens, SB-1, or HVT. The chickens were progeny of stock that had been vaccinated with HVT, and on day 21 the nonvaccinated group had higher levels of maternal antibodies to HVT than to other antigens (P < 0.05). Only SB-1 vaccine had induced antibodies by day 21, and this was detected only against homologous antigens. On day 49, all three vaccines had induced higher levels of antibodies to homologous than to heterologous antigens. Marek's Disease virus (MDV) induced antibodies to all three antigens, but challenging vaccinated chicks did not significantly increase levels of antibodies on day 81 to any of the three antigens. It was concluded that an ELISA using whole cells as antigens would have potential value for monitoring the antibody response induced by MD vaccines and virulent MDV.#FRE#
