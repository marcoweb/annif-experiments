#ITI#Effect of long-term application of organic amendment on C storage in relation to global warming potential and biological activities in tropical flooded soil planted to rice#FTI#
#IRE#The impact of long term organic amendments on the functional microbial activities, soil carbon (C) storage in relation to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from rice field was investigated in a tropical Aeric Endoaquept. The treatments included unamended control, farmyard manure (FYM), green manure (GM) (Sesbania aculeata), FYM + GM and rice straw (RS) + GM combination. Our results suggest that the FYM + GM treatment has increased the global warming potential (GWP) by 110 % as well decreased the C efficiency ratio by 24 % in comparison to control. On the other hand, under RS + GM treatment the soil organic C and total C contents were significantly higher to the tune of 34 and 53 %, respectively. Our studies clearly reveal that the application of RS + GM at 1:1 [Nitrogen (N) basis] could probably be the best soil amendment to sequester the soil organic C. Such amendments may not only have practical application value but also lead to higher yield capacity and minimize emission of GHG under flooded tropical rice soil systems.
