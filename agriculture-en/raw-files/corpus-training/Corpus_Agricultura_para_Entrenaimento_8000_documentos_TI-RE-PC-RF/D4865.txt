#ITI#Effects of temperature and stabilizer on the viability of a live attenuated avian metapneumovirus vaccine#FTI#
#IRE#A commercial live attenuated, freeze-dried avian metapneumovirus vaccine, PneumomuneTM, was assessed for its viability at three different temperatures (5.6 C, 21 C, and 37 C). No significant reduction in virus titer was observed when the vaccine was stored at 5.6 C for a period of 24 hr. However, reductions in virus titer of 1 log10 and 2 log10 were observed after 24 hr at 21 C and 37 C, respectively. Batch-to-batch variation in virus reduction was also observed. The addition of a dye or a vaccine stabilizer to the vaccine preparation did not have any deleterious effect on the survival of vaccine virus.#FRE#
