#ITI#Effect of Simulated Waterlogging Condition Imposed at Early Vegetative Growth on Final Yield in Greengram (Vigna radiata)#FTI#
#IRE#Background: ‘Rain’ plays a very important role since most of the agricultural productivity is rainfall dependent. However at the same time unpredictable and untimely rainfall are also responsible for crop loss. In India, our North-eastern region receives the highest amount of rainfall. Even in pre-monsoon season, our region receives very high amount of rainfall which hampers the crop production, especially the summer season greengram. Hence, an effort had been made to screen some genotypes of summer greengram, tolerant to waterlogging condition. A study was carried out during the summer season to evaluate the physiological performance of some greengram genotypes as influenced by waterlogging condition of varying duration imposed at early vegetative stage of growth. Methods: From an initial screening of forty genotypes in laboratory condition, five genotypes were selected based on germination percentage, seedling length and vigour index. These five genotypes were further evaluated in a pot experiment with four treatment combinations comprising of control (T1), waterlogging for 4 days (T2), waterlogging for 8 days (T3) and waterlogging for 12 days (T4). Waterlogging conditions were created in the pots at the time of sowing. Result: Water logging caused adverse effect on growth and development of all the genotypes, with the longest waterlogging showing severe deleterious effect. The parameters viz. germination percentage, leaf chlorophyll content, leaf area, plant height, nitrate reductase activity, number of seeds pod-1, pods plant-1, root length, number of root nodules plant-1 and harvest index were found to decline under waterlogged condition whereas, lipid peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity showed higher values under waterlogged condition. The performance of the genotype Sadiya Local was found to be the best from the point of view of tolerance as indicated by higher seed yield followed by AKM 12-28. The better performance of this genotype appeared to be related to the higher values for some traits viz. germination percentage, leaf chlorophyll, nitrate reductase activity, superoxide dismutase activity, number of pods plant-1 and harvest index. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
