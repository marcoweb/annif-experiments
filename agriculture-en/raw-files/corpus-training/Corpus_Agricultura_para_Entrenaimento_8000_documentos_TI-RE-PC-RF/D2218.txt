#ITI#Simulation of a regional soil nitrogen balance in Swiss croplands#FTI#
#IRE#Nitrogen (N) management in cropping systems needs adjustments because constraints to crop production are mostly related to high inputs and low recovery of N fertilizers. We used the DayCent model to predict regional N inputs, outputs, and balances of Swiss soils under (1) a range of N fertilizer input levels (0–300% of recommended crop-specific rates) and (2) organic fertilization, reduced tillage or cover cropping at the recommended input of N. The crops included wheat, maize, and root/tuber crops and legumes. Decreasing N inputs reduced the environmental impact by 13.5–51.3 kg N ha- 1, but it also reduced the yield by 6.8–44.8 kg N ha- 1. Increasing N inputs led to an increase in yield by 5.6–29.5 kg N ha- 1, but with additional losses of 14.9–181.8 kg N ha- 1 into the environment. Harvested crop N and NO3- leaching accounted for 30–59% and 27–62% of fertilizer-derived changes in total N output, respectively. Converting conventional to organic cropping led to a mean increase in soil N balance by 0.3–62.6 kg N ha- 1. The soil N balance increased the most by using partially decomposed organic fertilizer in combination with cover cropping and reduced tillage. However, this positive N balance was mainly due to a reduction in N removal with harvest and NO3- leaching. The use of highly decomposable organic matter and cover cropping did not lead to any N yield penalty while decreasing NO3- leaching. These results highlight that organic practices combined with reduced tillage and cover cropping can optimize the use and recovery of N resources. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
