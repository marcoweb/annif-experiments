#ITI#Nitrogen balance and accumulation pattern in three contrasting prairie soils receiving repeated applications of liquid swine and solid cattle manure#FTI#
#IRE#The expansion of intensive livestock operations in western Canada has increased concerns about overloading of nutrients in manured lands. The magnitude of nutrient accumulation and its distribution in the soil profile varies with soil-climatic conditions. The objective of this study was to determine loading and distribution of manure-derived nitrogen (N) in the soil profile as influenced by repeated manure applications. Four field experiments were conducted at three sites (Dixon, Melfort and Plenty) in Saskatchewan under longer-term manure management. The four field experiments provide contrasts in soil type, climatic conditions, manure type, application and cropping history to enable the effect of these factors to be evaluated. Liquid hog manure (LHM-Experiment 1) and solid cattle manure (SCM-Experiment 2) treatments were applied annually over 8 years at Dixon (Black Chernozemic loam soil-Udic Boroll in sub-humid climate), while only LHM was applied at Plenty (Dark Brown Chernozemic heavy clay soil-Typic Boroll in semi-arid climate) over 6years (Experiment 3), and at Melfort (Dark Gray Luvisol silty clay loam soil-Mollic Cryoboralf in humid climate) over 5 years (Experiment 4). Soil samples were collected in the spring and autumn of 2003 and 2004, and were analyzed for organic N, ammonium-N (NH4+-N) and nitrate-N (NO 3--N) concentrations. Plant samples were collected to determine the impact of manure application rate on plant N uptake and crop N removal. The annual application of LHM (37,000 L ha-1 yr -1) and SCM (7.6 Mg ha-1 yr-1) at agronomic rates at Dixon (added N balances crop demand for that year), or larger rates of LHM (111,000 L ha-1) applied once every 3 years (Melfort) did not significantly elevate NO3--N in soil compared to the unfertilized control. Lower crop removal and reduced leaching of NO 3--N due to drier conditions as occurred at the Plenty site contributed to greater accumulation of nitrate in the top 60 cm at equivalent rates compared to the other two sites. At large manure rates, excess N from the balance estimates could not be accounted for in soil organic N and was assumed to be lost from the soil-plant system. At the Dixon LHM site, deep leaching of NO3--N was observed at the excessive rate (148,000 L ha-1 yr-1) up to the 150 cm depth, compared to the control. At Dixon, the large annual application rate of SCM (30.4 Mg ha -1 yr-1) did not significantly increase NO 3--N in the 0-60 cm soil compared to the control, which was attributed to lower mineralization of organic N from the SCM. Over the short and medium term, LHM application at large rates every year poses a greater risk for loading and deep migration of NO3--N in soil than large rates of SCM. Larger single applications made once every 3 years were not associated with accumulation or deep leaching. To prevent loading, rates of applied manure nitrogen should be reduced when crop N removal potential is diminished by high frequency of drought. Â© 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.#FRE#
