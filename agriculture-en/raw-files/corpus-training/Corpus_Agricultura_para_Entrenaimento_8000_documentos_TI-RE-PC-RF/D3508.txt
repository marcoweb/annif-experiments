#ITI#Spray classification for selected flat fan nozzles#FTI#
#IRE#The flat fan nozzles made by Mikołajczak Agro Technology Company (MMAT) (standard RS, and pre-orifice AZ), in the ISO sizes of: 02, 03, and 04 were evaluated. The spray quality parameters: D V10, D V50, D V90, and RS, in the working pressure range of: 150, 300 and 450 kPa, were determined. The coefficient of volume fraction droplets smaller than 100 μm was also calculated. The spray classification of MMAT nozzles was defined according to ASAE standards. This information should be useful for the sprayer operator when making a selection of a field sprayer's working parameters according to the pesticide use guide.#FRE#
