#ITI#Effects of bio-rational insecticides on selected biological aspects of the egyptian cotton leafworm spodoptera littoralis (boisd.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)#FTI#
#IRE#Effectiveness of 8 bio-rational insecticides, Dipel 2x, BioFly, Agrin, BioGaurd, Spinosad, Neemix, Mectin and Match were tested at recommended dose, half of recommended dose and quarter of recommended dose against 1st, 3rd and 5th instar larvae and the egg masses (24, 48 and 72 h old) of the Egyptian cotton leafworm Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) under laboratory conditions. All the bio-rational insecticides provided higher mortality in the first instar larvae comparing to the third and fifth instar larvae, although Match, Mectin and Spinosad showed also excellent efficacy against third larval stage of S. littoralis at all tested concentrations. Also, Match showed 100% mortality of fifth instar larvae at all tested concentrations.The mortality rates of S. littoralis eggs of different ages (24, 48 and 72 h old) when dipped in recommended dose of each insecticide diluted in water were investigated. At recommended dose of all insecticides eggs of different ages were highly affected and the reductions of hatchability were 83.4, 85.0 and 71.7%, respectively in Spinosad compared to the control. In general, eggs 48 and 72 h old were less sensitive than younger eggs 24 h old. The latent effect of bio-rational insecticides on egg hatchability of S. littoralis was observed only in Match and Neemix with the average being 55.0% and 51.6% respectively.Our results suggest that Match, Mectin and Spinosad are potentially effective compounds for control of S. littoralis.#FRE#
