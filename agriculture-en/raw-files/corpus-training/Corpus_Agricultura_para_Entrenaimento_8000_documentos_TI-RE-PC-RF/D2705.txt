#ITI#Evaluation of combined effect of micronutrients and rhizobial inoculation on mungbean productivity#FTI#
#IRE#Micronutrients play an important role in increasing yield of pulses and oilseed legumes through their effects on the plant itself and on the nitrogen fixing symbiotic process. Indian soils have become deficient not only in major plant nutrients like (NPK) but also scarce in some micronutrients like zinc, iron, molybdenum and boron. These situations suggest the need of application of micronutrients along with biofertilizers under intensive cultivation of legumes as it is directly involved in biological nitrogen fixation through nitrogenase enzyme activity. In the present research investigation, different micronutrients iron, molybdenum and their combination in the form of ferrous sulphate, ammonium molybdate and ferrous sulphate+ammonium molybdate @2.0, 2.0 and 2.5 kg/h are added into micronutrient deficient soil for plant growth promotion of mungbean under pot house condition. Among various treatments, ammonium molybdate application @2.0kg/h along with rhizobial isolate HSR1 and PSB increases nodulation (28.6%), plant biomass (18.5%), seed yield (41%) as compared to sole application of biofertilizer. © 2020, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
