#IRE#Background: In order to reveal the pollination biological characteristics of Lespedeza davurica, wild L.davurica from eight regions of Shanxi Province was used as test materials to study their floral dynamic, pollen storage and other aspects. Methods: During 2019, the flowering dynamics of wild L. davurica collected from eight regions of Shanxi Province were observed by selecting the better-grown L.davurica. Freshly bloomed flowers were picked, and their pollen was set up for two treatments, dry and undried, for pollen storage experiments. Pollen viability was determined by the TTC (expand for first instance) and MTT (expand for first instance) methods and stigma receptivity was determined by the hydrogen peroxide-benzidine method. Result: The results showed us the following points: the flowers of L. davurica were pale yellow, large and fragrant; it usually opens from the base to the top with distinctly asymmetrical petals; it opens during the day and closes at night; the number of flowers reached its peak between 12:00 and 14:00. After measuring the pollen viability of L. davurica, we found that dry storage at-20°C was the most effective treatment. And with the increase of temperature and decrease of humidity, the pollen viability and stigma receptivity of L. davurica increased continuously and the highest viability value occurs between 12:00 and 14:00. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
