#ITI#Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase isoenzymes play an important role in the filling and quality of Arabidopsis thaliana seed#FTI#
#IRE#Three plant-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC1 to PPC3) and two phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase (PPCKs: PPCK1 and 2) genes are present in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. In seeds, all PPC genes were found to be expressed. Examination of individual ppc mutants showed little reduction of PEPC protein and global activity, with the notable exception of PPC2 which represent the most abundant PEPC in dry seeds. Ppc mutants exhibited moderately lower seed parameters (weight, area, yield, germination kinetics) than wild type. In contrast, ppck1-had much altered (decreased) yield. At the molecular level, ppc3-was found to be significantly deficient in global seed nitrogen (nitrate, amino-acids, and soluble protein pools). Also, N-deficiency was much more marked in ppck1-, which exhibited a tremendous loss of 95% and 90% in nitrate and proteins, respectively. The line ppck2-had accumulated amino-acids but lower levels of soluble proteins. Regarding carboxylic acid pools, Krebs cycle intermediates were found to be diminished in all mutants; this was accompanied by a consistent decrease in ATP. Lipids were stable in ppc mutants, however ppck1-seeds accumulated more lipids while ppck2-seeds showed high level of polyunsaturated fatty acid oleic and linolenic (omega 3). Altogether, the results indicate that the complete PEPC and PPCK family are needed for normal C/N metabolism ratio, growth, development, yield and quality of the seed. © 2022 The Authors#FRE#
