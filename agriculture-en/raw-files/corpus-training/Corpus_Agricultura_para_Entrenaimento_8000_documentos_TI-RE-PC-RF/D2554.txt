#ITI#Standardization of fertigation technology for transplanted pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.]#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted during kharif, 2015-16 at Agricultural College Farm, Raichur to ‘standardize fertigation technology for higher productivity of transplanted pigeonpea [Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.] on vertisols’ in the north-eastern dry zone of Karnataka. The results revealed higher number of pods (693.31) seed weight (12.16 g plant-1) stalk (5301 kg ha-1) and seed yields (3340 kg ha-1) with drip fertigation of recommended N and P2O5 (25:50 kg ha-1) in five splits using water soluble fertilizers (WSF) compared to other drip fertigation of water soluble and normal fertilizers at different levels of splits. Whereas significantly lower number of pods, seed weight and yield attributes were recorded with normal practice of soil application of commercial fertilizers without irrigation. Application of water soluable fertilizer (WSF) at 100 per cent RDF in 5 splits through drip method of irrigation also recorded higher gross returns (Rs.1,83,700 ha-1), net returns (Rs. 1,41,983 ha-1) and BC ratio (4.40) compared to all other treatments. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
