#ITI#Nutrient flows and balances in urban and peri-urban agroecosystems of Kano, Nigeria#FTI#
#IRE#Nutrient balances are useful indicators to assess the sustainability of farming systems. This study study investigates inflow and outflow of major nutrients in urban and periurban production systems in Kano, Nigeria. To this end, 16 households representing three different urban and peri-urban (UPA) farming systems were studied using the MONQI toolbox (formerly known as NUTMON) to calculate nutrient flows and economic performances. The farm nitrogen (N) balance was positive at 56.6, 67.4 and 56.4 kg farm-1 year-1 for commercial garden and crop-livestock (cGCL), commercial gardening and semi-commercial livestock (cGscL) and commercial livestock subsistence field cropping (cLsC) farm types, respectively. The same trend was observed for phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in all farm types except an annual negative K balance of 16 kg farm-1 in cGCL. Across the different activities within the farms, land uses had positive N (359, 387 and 563 kg N ha-1 year-1) and P (74, 219 and 411 kg P ha-1 year-1) balances for all farm types, but again a negative K balance in cGCL with an average loss of 533 kg K ha-1 year-1. Partial nutrient balances in livestock production indicated a positive balance for all nutrients across the farms types but were slightly negative for P in cLsC. Commercial livestock keeping (cLsC) was economically more profitable than the other farm types with an average annual gross margin (GM) and net cash flow (NCF) of $9,033 and $935. Cropping activities within cGCL and cGscL had GMs of $1,059 and $194 and NCFs of $757 and $206, respectively, but livestock activities in both farm types incurred financial losses. Potassium inputs were limited under vegetable and crop production of cGCL, threatening long-term K nutrient availability in this system. Overall, the results indicated large annual surpluses of N and P in urban and peri-urban vegetable and crop production systems which pose a potential threat when lost to the environment. Appropriate policies should aim at promoting sustainable production through efficient nutrient management in the Kano UPA sector. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
