#ITI#Unveiling the efficacy of pre-emergent application of young Eucalyptus globulus leaves as a weed control strategy: Bridging macroscopic effects and cellular responses#FTI#
#IRE#Allelopathy, the inhibition of neighbouring plant growth by certain plants, can be particularly useful if applied in a targeted way for weed management. So, this study aimed to assess and characterize the herbicidal activity of fresh and dried leaves from young Eucalyptus globulus Labill. trees applied as a soil amendment. For this, fresh and dried leaves (FL and DL, respectively) were incorporated into the soil at different concentrations (0, 1, 5, and 10% w/w), where Portulaca oleracea L. seeds were sown. After 5 weeks of exposure, results revealed that the soil incorporation of DL at 10% (w/w) presented the strongest herbicidal properties, inhibiting seed germination by 63% and inducing the loss of cell viability. To unravel the possible mode of action and the main targets at both cellular and subcellular levels, an in vitro experiment was performed. Purslane seeds were sown in a nutritive medium containing different dilutions of an aqueous extract prepared with dried eucalyptus leaves. After 5 days of exposure, germinated seedlings were processed for transmission electron microscopy and histological analyses as well as for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in vivo detection by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results revealed that the allelochemical release from DL induced ROS overproduction, resulting in the loss of cell integrity and organization, which was characterized by damage to several cellular sub-structures, along with enhanced accumulation of lipid droplets. Overall, the incorporation of DL into the soil can represent a sustainable alternative to reduce synthetic herbicide application and subsequent environmental contamination. © 2023 The Authors#FRE#
