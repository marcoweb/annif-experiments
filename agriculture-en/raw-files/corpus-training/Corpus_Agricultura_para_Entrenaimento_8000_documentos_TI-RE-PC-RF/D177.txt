#ITI#Physiological defense and metabolic strategy of Pistia stratiotes in response to zinc-cadmium co-pollution#FTI#
#IRE#Pistia stratiotes is a cadmium (Cd) hyperaccumulating plant with strong bioaccumulation and translocation capacity for Cd. A hydroponic experiment was used to evaluate the combined effect of Zinc (Zn) and Cd at different concentrations on leaf growth and metabolism of P. stratiotes. This study revealed the physiological defense and metabolic strategy of responses to Zn–Cd co-pollution. With the Zn50Cd1, Zn50Cd10, Zn100Cd1, and Zn100Cd10 treatments for 9 d, the relative crown diameter, relative leave number, and ramet number of the plant had no significant difference with the control. Under the compound treatments containing Zn50Cd50 and Zn100Cd50, the activity of the glyoxalase system and amino acid metabolism in the leaves were inhibited. The leaf photosynthetic apparatus increased heat dissipation to reduce the damage to the photosystem II (PS II) reaction center caused by excess excitation energy under Zn–Cd stress. This safeguarded the balance between the absorption and utilization of light energy. Compared to the control, the Zn and Cd co-pollution for 9 d had no effect on the reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) contents. There was no effect on the dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities, but there was increased ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity and oxidized ascorbic acid (DHA) content. These increased the antioxidant capacity of the ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle. The treated plants also had increased levels of carnosol and substances related to lipid metabolism including 9, 10-Dihydroxystearate, Prostaglandin G2, Sphingosine, and 13-L-Hydroperoxylinoleic acid, maintaining the cell stability and resistance to the Zn–Cd stress. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
