#ITI#Increased drought resistance in state transition mutants is linked to modified plastoquinone pool redox state#FTI#
#IRE#Identifying traits that exhibit improved drought resistance is highly important to cope with the challenges of predicted climate change. We investigated the response of state transition mutants to drought. Compared with the wild type, state transition mutants were less affected by drought. Photosynthetic parameters in leaves probed by chlorophyll fluorescence confirmed that mutants possess a more reduced plastoquinone (PQ) pool, as expected due to the absence of state transitions. Seedlings of the mutants showed an enhanced growth of the primary root and more lateral root formation. The photosystem II inhibitor 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)−1,1-dimethylurea, leading to an oxidised PQ pool, inhibited primary root growth in wild type and mutants, while the cytochrome b6f complex inhibitor 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropylbenzoquinone, leading to a reduced PQ pool, stimulated root growth. A more reduced state of the PQ pool was associated with a slight but significant increase in singlet oxygen production. Singlet oxygen may trigger a, yet unknown, signalling cascade promoting root growth. We propose that photosynthetic mutants with a deregulated ratio of photosystem II to photosystem I activity can provide a novel path for improving crop drought resistance. © 2023 The Authors.
