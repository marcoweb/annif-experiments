#ITI#Effect of incorporation of crop residues and organic manures on adsorption/desorption and bio-availability of phosphate#FTI#
#IRE#Transformations of applied phosphorus (P) to unavailable residual soil P is the major cause of limited P supply in most of the P-deficient soils. The effect of the incorporation of crop residues (rice straw [RS] and wheat straw [WS]) and organic manures (farmyard manure [FYM] and green manure [GM]) on P release in soil and its bio-availability to various summer and winter crops was investigated in laboratory and screen house experiments. Surface (0-0.15 m) soil samples collected after 32 years of differential fertilization to maize-wheat-cowpea fodder crop rotation, were examined for adsorption/desorption behavior of P, after incubating with organics of varying C:P ratios. Incorporation of crop residues increased P adsorption maxima as well as resistance to P release in soils. Increased buffering capacities in crop residue-incorporated treatments decreased P desorption in soil, whereas the incorporation of organic manures decreased P sorption, maximum buffering capacity (MBC), bonding energy, and increased P concentration in soil solution. Although the incorporation of crop residues decreased P release in soil its bio-availability in the soil-plant system was crop-specific and varied with the time of incorporation of organics. Raya showed increased P uptake with incorporation of both RS and WS, whereas in the case of berseem increased P uptake occurred only with wheat straw. Phosphorus uptake in rice, maize, and soybean decreased with the incorporation of both RS and WS. Incorporation of crop residues 1 day before the sowing of summer crops decreased P uptake, whereas incorporation 3 weeks prior to the sowing of winter crops improved P bio-availability. Incorporation of organic manures with a narrow C:P ratio, however, improved P uptake in all the crops under investigation, in both the seasons. The results thus emphasized that adsorption parameters calculated from the examination of soil samples should not be used independently for making fertilizer P recommendations. Crop effects (root exudates) and their interaction with P reaction products in soil and synchronization in P release from organics and crop uptake need to be considered to understand the virtual behavior of P bio-availability in the soil-plant system.
