#ITI#Assessment of yield and quality characteristics of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars with different fall dormancy rating#FTI#
#IRE#This research was conducted to determine performances of seven alfalfa cultivars with different fall dormancy rates in terms of dry matter yield and some quality parameters under Mediterranean conditions throughout the years of 2007-2009. In the study, cultivars were evaluated for dry matter yield (DMY), leaf/stem ratio (LSR), crude protein (CP) content, crude protein yield (CPY), acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), digestible dry matter (DDM) content and relative feed value (RFV). According to average of two year results, there were significant differences among alfalfa cultivars in terms of all characters studied. Mean DMY, LSR, contents of CP, ADF, NDF, DDM and RFV were determined as 18.147 t ha-1, 0.82, 17.4 %, 41.0 %, 49.0 %, 56.9 % and 114. The highest DMY averaged over two years was obtained from cultivar Nimet while lowest one was obtained from Magnum 5. As a dormant cultivar, Magnum 5 was superior in terms of LSR and CP content to the other alfalfa cultivars and it was lower in ADF and NDF content than the others. It was concluded that cultivar Nimet with the highest DMY and CPY yields can be recommended as a non-dormant cultivar for farmers in regions of Turkey with the Mediterranean climate. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
