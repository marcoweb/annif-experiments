#ITI#Reproductive habits are a main component of integral water-use efficiency on common bean#FTI#
#IRE#Water-Use Efficiency (WUE) integrally determined as seed production per unit of water consumed is a trait of recent interest; however, until now little research has been performed to evaluate the importance of different components as reproductive habits in such trait. The aim of this study was to determine if reproductive habits are a main component of integral WUE on common bean. Pinto Saltillo cultivar of high WUE in spring-summer and autumn-winter cycles generated 39.4 and 43.9 % fewer flowers than the cultivar susceptible to limited water conditions; nevertheless, a lower rate of abortion along with more efficient reproductive habits as the capacity to produce 1.6 seeds more per pod on average permitted Pinto Saltillo to have a higher integral WUE; therefore, reproductive habits had a great impact on the trait here studied and these should be considered on the breeding programs.
