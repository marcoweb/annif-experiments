#ITI#Combining ability studies under salinity stress and unstressed condition in chickpea#FTI#
#IRE#The present study was carried out to generate some information on the genetic basis for salinity tolerance in chickpea. Results indicated that the additive as well as non-additive gene action was important for all the traits under unstressed as well as salinity stress condition. Parent Pusa 1103 was a good combiner for RWC, MSI, seed yield and harvest index both under unstressed and salinity stress condition. DG 72 was a good combiner for RWC and parent SAKI 9516 for days to maturity both under unstressed and salinity stress. Two crosses Pusa 1103 x DG 72 and cross Pusa 1103 x DG 54 were best among all the crosses studied for seed yield per plant. While selecting best crosses for salinity stress tolerance besides giving more importance to salinity indices the seed yield per plant need to be considered. The present findings will help the chickpea breeder in deciding the breeding program aimed at improvement of salinity stress tolerant varieties in chickpea.
