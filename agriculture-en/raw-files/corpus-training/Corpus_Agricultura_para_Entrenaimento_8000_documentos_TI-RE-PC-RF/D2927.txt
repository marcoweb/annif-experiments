#ITI#Technological and extension yield gaps in greengram in Pali district of Rajasthan, India#FTI#
#IRE#The technological gap between existing and recommended technologies of greengram crop was studied during 2012, 2013 and 2014. The study in total 40 frontline demonstrations was conducted on farmers’ fields in five adopted villages. The findings of the study revealed that improved technology recorded a mean yield of 982 kg/ha which was 35.5% higher than obtained with farmers’ practice (755 kg/ha). The study exhibited mean extension gap of 267 kg/ha, technology gap of 368 kg/ha with mean technology index of 27.3%. An additional investment of Rs. 1470/ha coupled with recommended nutrient, water management, plant protection measures, scientific monitory and non-monetary factors resulted in additional mean returns of Rs.10970/ha. Higher mean net income of Rs. 46030/ha with a Benefit: Cost ratio of 4.3 was obtained with improved technologies in comparison to farmers’ practices (Rs. 38775/ha).The frontline demonstrations conducted on greengram at the farmers’ field revealed that the adoption of improved technologies significantly increased the yield as well as yield attributing traits of crop and also the net returns to the farmers. © 2017, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
