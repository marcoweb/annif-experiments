#ITI#Water budget components estimation for a mature citrus orchard of southern China based on HYDRUS-1D model#FTI#
#IRE#Minimizing the adverse impacts of soil erosion and seasonal drought are critical to sustain production for citrus orchards on red soil slopes in Southern China. Investigation of water budget between water supply and crop water demand is important to develop specific soil and water conservation measures to effectively utilize rainwater and irrigation in dry season. In this study, the surface runoff and soil water content at depths of 10 cm,20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 60 cm, and 100 cm in the soil were monitored, and HYDRUS-1D model was employed to estimate the evapotranspiration and deep percolation at a mature citrus orchard in southern China. The results show that the annual effective rainfall in citrus orchards in the study area during 2010–2015 was 560.8–1071.2 mm, with an average of 812.4 mm. The average effective rainfall from April to September was more than 70 mm per month, and the total amount accounted for 66.63 % of the annual effective rainfall. Deep percolation could account for 18.85 %–65.65 % of the effective rainfall, which was the main factor affecting the effective rainfall. The water demand of citrus was 645.4–994.9 mm, with an average of 843.2 mm. The average water demand of 6 years from May to August was over 90 mm per month, accounting for 55.34 % of the whole growth period, which was the key period of citrus water demand. Seasonal water deficit may occur in both high and low rainfall years in the study area, and the frequency and degree of water shortage are prominent from July to October. According to a water demand analysis, surface runoff collected by rainwater harvesting for irrigation can satisfy the water shortage for citrus during the fruit growth period. Measures to reduce deep percolation should also be considered to increase the effective rainfall for sloping citrus orchards. © 2020#FRE#
