#ITI#Efficacy of five commonly used disinfectants against turkey arthritis reovirus#FTI#
#IRE#Since late 2009, an unusual problem of reovirus-related lameness has been seen in market-age tom turkeys in the upper Midwest area of the United States. In this study, we determined the efficacy of five commonly used disinfectants (Virocid, Keno X5, Synergize, One Stroke, and Tek Trol) against turkey arthritis reoviruses (TARVs). For comparison, turkey enteric reovirus (TERV) and chicken arthritis reovirus (CARV) were also included. At their recommended concentrations, all five disinfectants were found to be effective virucidals, inactivating 99.99% of all viruses within 10 min. However, oxidizing agents and quaternary ammonium compounds + aldehyde types of disinfectants were more effective, killing the viruses in a shorter time (2-5 min) than the other types of disinfectants. These results indicate that these disinfectants can be an effective tool in the control of these viruses. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
