#ITI#Influence of vermicompost and split applied nitrogen on growth, yield, nutrient uptake and soil fertility in pole type french bean (Phaseolus vulgaris l.) in an acid alfisol#FTI#
#IRE#A field experiment was conducted for two years at Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University, Palampur on the influence of vermicompost and split applied nitrogen in pole French bean. Twelve treatment combinations comprising of organic manures, nitrogen fertilization and methods of application were evaluated. The performance of yield and yield related traits increased significantly with application of vermicompost, 125% of recommended nitrogen through split application. Use of vermicompost + 125% nitrogen resulted in highest seed yield (10.43 q/ha) and NPK uptake. Seed yield and NPK uptake with application of vermicompost + 75% N was at par with that of recommended application of N indicating thereby saving of 25% of nitrogen fertilizers. Split applied nitrogen at 125% of recommended dose resulted in 50% increase in seed yield over basal application. Hence, application of vermicompost and split applied nitrogen is a better option to harness high seed productivity and to maintain soil fertility. © 2018, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
