#ITI#Efficacy of Different Insecticides/Botanicals against Pea Stemfly, Ophiomyia phaseoli (Tryon)#FTI#
#IRE#Studies were conducted at Instructional farm, College of Agriculture, SKRAU, Bikaner during rabi, 2016-17. Among the nine insecticides/ botanicals evaluated against O. phaseoli, the treatment of cartap-hydrochloride was found the most effective followed by phorate 10, acephate, oxydemeton-methyl, quinalphos and dimethoate whereas, NSKE was found the least effective followed by neem oil (0.5%) and azadirachtin (5.0 ml/ltr). The maximum seed yield was obtained in the treatment of cartap-hydrochloride whereas, it was minimum in control. The maximum incremental benefit-cost ratio was obtained in the treatment of acephate (33.22) while, minimum in NSKE. The maximum net return of RS. 25846 ha-1 was obtained from the treatment of cartap-hydrochloride while, the minimum net return of Rs. 3856 ha-1 was obtained from NSKE.
