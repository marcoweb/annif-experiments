#ITI#Mycoflora Associated with Decomposition of Rice Stubble Mixed with Soil#FTI#
#IRE#Fungi inhabiting rice stubble mixed with soil were isolated by dilution plate technique. Moisture content of decomposed rice stubble mixed with soil was 25.32% in the month of August and minimum (5.35%) in the month of April and pH varied between 6.8-7.2. The highest (47.68 x 104) fungal population in 1 g of rice stubble mixed with soil was recorded in the month of October and the lowest (16.88 x 104) in the month of May. A total of twenty-nine fungal species were recorded during the entire period of decomposition. Dueteromycetous fungi constituted 75.86 per cent of total fungal population followed by zygomycetous, oomycetous and ascomycetous fungi. Monthly variation in fungal population was correlated with substrate availability and climatic factors. Dominance of Rhizopus stolonifer, Aspergillus flavus and Trichoderma harzianum was recorded during the decomposition while Pestalotia mangiferae, Torula graminis and Alternaria solani were obtained as rare fungal species. © 2008, Versita.
