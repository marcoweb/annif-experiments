#ITI#Spent mushroom compost as a nitrogen source for spring barley#FTI#
#IRE#Spent mushroom compost (SMC) contains a range of plant nutrients, including nitrogen (N), a large proportion of which originate from arable crops. Using SMC as an organic fertilizer for crops recycles these nutrients. Effective use of SMC in fertilizer regimes requires knowledge of the nitrogen fertilizer value (NFV) of the SMC, which is the amount of mineral fertilizer N required to give the same N yield, or marketable yield, as an application of SMC. The objectives of these experiments were to evaluate the effect of SMC on spring barley grain yield and quality and to determine its NFV. Experiments were carried out on two soils, light- and medium-textured, over 3 years (2008–2010). The experiments compared the yield response and N uptake of spring barley to fertilizer N with and without SMC. SMC application gave similar or higher grain yield and N uptake compared to fertilizer only treatments at corresponding fertilizer N rates. SMC had no significant (P > 0.05) effect on the economic optimum fertilizer N rate but the maximum yield was significantly (P < 0.05) higher where SMC was applied in two of the six experiments. Effects of SMC on grain quality were small. Results indicated that the NFV, expressed as a proportion of the total N applied in SMC, ranged from 0.05 to 0.29 kg kg−1 N applied in SMC, with a mean of 0.15 kg kg−1. It is concluded that SMC can contribute to the nitrogen nutrition of small grain cereal crops in high yield potential environments. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
