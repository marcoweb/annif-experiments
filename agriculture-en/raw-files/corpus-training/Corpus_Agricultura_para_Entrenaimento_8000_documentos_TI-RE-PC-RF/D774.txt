#ITI#Sodium nitrophenolate mediates brassinosteroids signaling to enhance cold tolerance of cucumber seedling#FTI#
#IRE#Cold stress (CS) significantly limits cucumber yield. However, it remains unclear whether and how sodium nitrophenolate (CSN) regulates plant responses to cold stress. Here, H2O, CSN, 24-epibrassinolide (EBR), and CSN + EBR were sprayed on cucumber seedlings before or after CS, and on control plants. We found that CSN, EBR, or EBR + CSN pre-treatment improved seedling growth under normal conditions (control condition) and cold tolerance under CS conditions. EBR pre-treatment promoted the expression of approximately half of the genes involved in BR synthesis and signaling and CsICE-CsCBF-CsCOR under CS. However, CSN pre-treatment promoted almost all the expression of BR synthesis and signaling genes, and CsICE-CsCBF-CsCOR genes, which showed the highest expression in early CS, remarkably improving the cold tolerance of cucumber. Interestingly, EBR and CSN had a superimposed effect on the expression of BR synthesis and signaling and CsICE-CsCBF-CsCOR genes, which rapidly increased their expression under normal temperature. Spraying EBR after CS accelerated seedling recovery, whereas CSN had the opposite effect. However, spraying CSN combined with EBR accelerated the recovery of CS-injured seedlings and was better than spraying EBR alone. Although CS-injured seedlings were negatively influenced by CSN, pre-treatment with CSN accelerated seedling growth and increased cold tolerance, suggesting that the effect of CSN was related to whether the seedlings were damaged by CS. In conclusion, we firstly found that CSN enhanced cold tolerance by activating BR signaling, contributing to the gene expression of ICE-CBF-COR and that CSN + EBR contributed to cold tolerance and CS-injured seedling recovery in cucumber. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
