#ITI#Field soil and ditch sediment phosphorus dynamics from two artificially drained fields on poorly drained soils#FTI#
#IRE#The installation of artificial drains alters soil permeability such that migrating water interacts with soil and sediment biogeochemistry to mobilise or attenuate phosphorus (P). Soil and ditch sediment P chemistry was explored at two artificially drained sites with similar land use, management and drainage class. Site A was characterised by high total P content (282–1437 mg kg−1) and elevated water soluble P (WSP) (10.11 mg kg−1) in a Humic topsoil. Subsurface horizons contained high amounts of leached aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe) and P sorption capacities expressed by the Freundlich K term increased with depth from 338 to 942 mg kg−1. Site B was characterised by low TP (58–476 mg kg−1) and low P sorption capacities (40–173 mg kg−1) that decreased with depth, owing to a high% sand and low Al. Bankside and sediment in the ditch were mostly higher or comparable to P sorption properties measured in subsurface soil horizons from adjacent fields. Dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations were monitored in the open ditch, end-of-pipe and in-field piezometers and highest values were recorded in the open ditch (0.03–0.183 mg l−1) at Site A, potentially due to diffuse and point sources on the farm. Higher P concentrations were recorded at end-of-pipe locations compared to piezometers at similar depth, and attributed to a larger contributing area reaching the pipe from the surface and surrounding subsurface layers. Attenuation of WSP by subsoil at Site A was evidenced by low piezometer values (0–0.003 mg l−1). Low P sorption in the ditch at Site B suggests that dredging could expose low P sorbing layers, but adding topsoil could enhance P sorption. Drainage design, maintenance, and measures for P mitigation require an assessment of surface and subsurface P dynamics to ensure a ‘right measure right place’ approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
