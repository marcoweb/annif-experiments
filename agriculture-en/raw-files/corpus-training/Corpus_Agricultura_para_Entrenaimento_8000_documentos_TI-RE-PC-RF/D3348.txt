#ITI#Growth Promotion and Charcoal Rot Management in Chickpea by Trichoderma Harzianum#FTI#
#IRE#The strains of Trichoderma harzianum were assessed for their effect on chickpea growth and control of charcoal rot caused by Macrophomina phaseolina in greenhouse assay. T. harzianum strain 25-92 significantly increased the fresh and dry weights by 50-63% and 24-42%, respectively, whereas strain 29-92 increased the fresh weight of chickpea cv. Radhey and Vishwas by 12-30% but not the dry weight in the absence of M. phaseolina. A marked increase in root length was caused by both the strains. In M. phaseolina infested pots, number of lateral roots and branching decreased with nonsignificant change in weight. Significant (P = 0.05) reduction in charcoal rot disease was observed in the pots amended with T. harzianum at all the concentrations. Moreover, 60-40% reduction in disease was recorded after 14 and 28 days in chickpea varieties Radhey and Vishwas. The resistant variety Vijay does not show significant disease. The reduction in disease was more pronounced at higher inoculum concentrations of T. harzianum (107-108 cfu/g). Overall, Trichoderma strain 25-92 improved plant growth and reduced damage in presence of the pathogen. Besides disease control the growth promoting properties of the strain improve the efficacy for commercial application. Â© 2008, Versita. All rights reserved.#FRE#
