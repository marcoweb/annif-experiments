#ITI#Impact of Exogenous Plant Growth Regulators on Physiological Traits, Tendril and Flowering in Horsegram (Macrotyloma uniflorum Lam) under Kharif Season#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Horsegram is an important pulse crop grown as Rabi crop in Tamil Nadu. Kharif sown crop could not flowers may be because of more number of tendrils produced as compare to Rabi sown crop. Hence, an attempt was made to reduce the number of tendrils and induce flowering in horsegram during Kharif season by plant growth regulators. Methods: A field experiment was conducted to study the impact of plant growth regulators viz., salicylic acid (100 ppm), chlormequat chloride (CCC-250 ppm), mepiquat chloride (250 ppm), tri iodo benzoic acid (TIBA-200 ppm) and nitrobenzene (0.2%) on physiological traits and tendril growth associated with flowering in horsegram during Kharif. Different treatments were applied through foliar application at 25 Days after sowing. Result: Among the PGRs, foliar application of TIBA registered the lowest number of tendrils (2.3) followed by CCC (3.0) compared to other treatments. Higher root length of 16.8 cm and RWC of 82.3% was found in CCC treatment. CCC also registered the highest photosynthetic rate (27.15 µmol m-2 s-1), transpiration rate (18.06 mmol m-2 s-1) and lowest leaf temperature (26°C) compared to other treatments. The highest soluble protein content of 13.1 mg g-1 was also estimated in CCC treatment followed by mepiquat chloride (12.51 mg g-1). Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity did not show any significant difference between the treatments. Number of flowers buds formed per plant was zero and hence the flowering did not take place in any treatments. Among the plant growth regulators used, TIBA and CCC registered its positive action on reduced the number of tendrils and leaf temperature, but not enough to induce flowering under Kharif season. © 2022, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
