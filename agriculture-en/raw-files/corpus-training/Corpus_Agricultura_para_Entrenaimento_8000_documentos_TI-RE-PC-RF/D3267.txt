#ITI#Effect of Zinc Sources on Nutrient Content and Uptake in Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merril] under the Acidic Soil Conditions of Nagaland#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Soybean is an important legume as well as oil seed crop grown in a varied range of climate and soils. Zinc is an important micronutrient required for plants, animals and human. Its deficiency in soil is a worldwide concern for production of food crops. Therefore two years reseach in two locations were conducted in 2019 and 2020 to study the nutrient content and uptake of NPK and Zn in soybean with zinc fertilization. Methods: A two years research was conducted in two locations under the acidic soil conditions of Nagaland. Nutrient content and uptake of N, P, K and Zn were recorded at first, second year and pooled. The location, climate, altitude and soil fertility status were recorded in both the sites. Altogether there were 13 treatments and 3 replications.The experimental design used was simple RBD. The datas were recorded, analysed and computed statistically. Result: The nutrient uptake of N, K and Zn except P in soybean were significantly found to be increased @ 5 kg ha-1 ZnSO4 H2 O + RDF (T9) followed by T8 and T10 as compared to control in both the years and pooled.
