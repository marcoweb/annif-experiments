#ITI#Mathematical quantification of interactive complexity of transcription factors involved in proline-mediated regulative strategies in Oryza sativa under chromium stress#FTI#
#IRE#Involvement of transcription factor (TFs) in governing genes at transcription or post transcription level is known to have affirmative impact on plant physiological and morphological development, especially during environmental abuse. Application of exogenous proline (Pro) is one among the effective approaches to strengthen plant resistance against stresses. However, Pro-mediated regulative strategies of TFs in responses to the chromium (Cr) in rice plants through the gene interaction network are still not clear. In the current study, Pro-mediated interactive complexity of various TFs (i.e., MYB, NAC, WRKY, bHLH, and bZIP) under hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] was investigated using Agilent 4 × 44 K rice gene chip and gene interactive probability model (GIPM). Results showed that exogenous Pro had a negligible effect on Cr uptake in rice plants, while a small positive response in biomass accretion of rice seedlings was observed under Cr(VI)+Pro treatments which was to certain extend greater than single Cr(VI) treatments. Rice microarray analysis showed that Cr(VI) significantly (p < 0.05) repressed the expression of TFs in the rice roots and shoots, while the application of exogenous Pro significantly (p < 0.05) up-regulated the expression levels of some TFs in rice tissues. Mathematical modularization indicated that Pro-mediated interaction between MYB and NAC carried more weightage than other TFs in rice roots and shoots under Cr(VI) stress. Overall, our study provides convincing evidence to confirm a positive role of exogenous Pro on reducing the negative impact exerted by Cr(VI) on rice plants through regulating expression and interaction of different TFs. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
