#ITI#Yield of Spring Grown Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) under Different Doses of Soil Applied Phosphorus in An Agroecology of Semi-arid Highlands with Mediterranean Climate#FTI#
#IRE#Background: This study was carried out to determine the effects of different phosphorus doses on the flowering, yield and yield components of spring grown chickpea crop under the ecological conditions of Siirt province in the experimental field of Siirt University, Faculty of Agriculture, Field Crops Department during two seasons in 2018 and 2019. Methods: The study was carried out in randomized complete blocks design with three replications. Before planting, 140 kg ha-1 of DAP fertilizer (18.46.0) was spreaded and incorporated into the soil with a rake. Following emergence of plants, TSP fertilizer (0.42.0) was spreaded to the plots at doses of 0, 30, 60, 90 kg ha-1 P2 O5 into the mellow humid soil. Result: All observed parameters were effected from phosphorus application doses. Based on different P doses, two years’ average plant height, first pod height; main branch number, flower number per plant, pod number per plant, grain number per plant, 100 grain weight and grain yield values were determined as 51,25-55,91 cm; 29,17-35,98 cm; 2,10-2,97 piece plant-1; 39,00-57,86 piece plant-1; 18,87-27,92 piece plant-1; 18,00-27,33 piece plant-1; 29,92-33,41 g and 969-1565 kg ha-1, respectively. Highest values for all parameters were obtained from 60 kg ha-1 P2 O5 but further dose (60 kg ha-1 P2 O5) resulted with reduction from top values for all parameters. © 2021, Agricultural Research Communication Centre.
