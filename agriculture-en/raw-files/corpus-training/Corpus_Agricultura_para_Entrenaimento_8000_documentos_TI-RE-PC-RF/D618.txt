#ITI#Comprehensive quality evaluation of two different geography originated Angelica sinensis Radix based on potential production area development and resource protection#FTI#
#IRE#Angelica sinensis Radix (ASR) is mainly produced in the southern region of Gansu, China, and is a famous edible and medicinal herb. Noticeably, Aba region in Sichuan, China has similar geographical and climatic conditions to the southern region of Gansu, China, and has the potential to further develop the ASR planting industry chain. This study was the first to use an innovative method that combines GC-MS, HPLC-DAD fingerprints, and stoichiometric analysis to compare and explore the feasibility of using the Aba region as a source of high-quality ASR supplements. GC-MS analysis showed that the composition of ASR essential oil(AEO) in these two regions was highly similar (>99%). The HPLC data showed that the main sources of differences in ASR components between the two regions were coniferyl ferulate, E-ligustilide, Z-ligustilide, and Butylidenephthalide, which have great potential in anti-depression, regulating gut microbiota, and other aspects. The ASR in Aba region was rich in these components, and its biological activity might be higher to some extent than that in southern Gansu. This study confirmed the potential of the Aba region in Sichuan to become a high-quality production area for ASR, which was conducive to the expansion of ASR resources and the development of related industrial chains.
