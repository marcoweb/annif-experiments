#ITI#CDC48 regulates immunity pathway in tobacco plants#FTI#
#IRE#The CDC48 protein, highly conserved in the living kingdom, is a player of the ubiquitin proteasome system and contributes to various cellular processes. In plants, CDC48 is involved in cell division, plant growth and, as recently highlighted in several reports, in plant immunity. In the present study, to further extend our knowledge about CDC48 functions in plants, we analysed the incidence of its overexpression on tobacco development and immune responses. CDC48 overexpression disrupted plant development and morphology, induced changes in plastoglobule appearance and exacerbated ROS production. In addition, levels of salicylic acid (SA) and glycosylated SA were higher in transgenic plants, both in the basal state and in response to cryptogein, a protein produced by the oomycete Phytophthora cryptogea triggering defence responses. The expression of defence genes, notably those coding for some pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, was also exacerbated in the basal state in transgenic plant lines. Finally, tobacco plants overexpressing CDC48 did not develop necrosis in response to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection, suggesting a role for CDC48 in virus resistance. © 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS#FRE#
