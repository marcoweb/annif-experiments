#ITI#Heterosis and combining ability studies for economic traits in garden pea (Pisum sativum L.)#FTI#
#IRE#A line × tester analysis comprising of 7 promising lines and three testers having wider genetic base was carried out for pod yield and related horticultural traits in garden pea (Pisum sativum L.) Among parents, line 17, line 14 and Palam Triloki were observed as best general combiners for pod yield and majority of component traits. Cross, line 17 x Arkel showed high heterosis and SCA effects for pod yield and related horticultural traits. The cross combination line 17 x Palam Triloki was most promising for early flowering and green pod picking. For most of the traits including pod yield per plant nonadditive gene actions were of prime importance. © 2019, Agricultural Research Communication Centre. All rights reserved.#FRE#
