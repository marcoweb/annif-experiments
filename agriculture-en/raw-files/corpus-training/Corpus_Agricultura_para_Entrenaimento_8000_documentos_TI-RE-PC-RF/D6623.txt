#ITI#Where the straw-derived nitrogen gone in paddy field subjected to different irrigation regimes and straw placement depths? Evidence from 15N labeling#FTI#
#IRE#Straw-derived N is an organic N source, that plays an important role in agroecosystems. However, quantitatively tracing the release and fate of exogenous straw-derived N in a rice-soil system amended by irrigation regime and straw placement depth is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to determine the release and fate of straw-derived N in the rice-soil system under different irrigation regimes and straw placement depths. 15N-labeled rice straw was used for two consecutive years in a field experiment in Northeast China, and four treatments were established: (i) controlled irrigation + shallow straw return (5 cm depth, CSD1); (ii) controlled irrigation + deep straw return (15 cm depth, CSD2); (iii) flooded irrigation + shallow straw return (5 cm depth, FSD1); and (iv) flooded irrigation + deep straw return (15 cm depth, FSD2). We found that the temporal patterns of straw N release were best described by the one-pool model, which was helpful to predict the straw-derived N fluxes during straw decomposition under different irrigation regimes and straw placement depths. Controlled irrigation and shallow straw placement depth increased the straw N release rate, which was consistent with their effects on straw mass loss, especially in the first rice season, showing a decreasing order of CSD1 > CSD2 > FSD1 > FSD2. Irrigation regime and straw placement depth significantly affected the fate of straw-derived N in the rice-soil system. Controlled irrigation will not only increase plant utilization rates of straw-derived N at different straw placement depths but also promote soil sequestration of straw-derived N and reduce the loss of straw-derived N. Additionally, we also found that placing straw at a shallower depth can also increase straw-derived N utilization by plants. Coupling controlled irrigation and placing straw at a shallower depth (CSD1) resulted in the highest utilization of straw-derived N by plants. However, it is worth noting that placing straw at a shallower depth also increases the loss of straw-derived N, which may increase the risk of environmental pollution in a soil-rice system. This study expanded the theory of straw N release and effective utilization in agroecosystems, which is helpful to better predict gross N fluxes and fates of straw-derived N in the agroecosystem to formulate a scientific and reasonable mode of field management with straw return. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.#FRE#
