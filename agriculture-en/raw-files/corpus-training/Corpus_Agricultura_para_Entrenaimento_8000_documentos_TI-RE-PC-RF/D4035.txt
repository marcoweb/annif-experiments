#ITI#Diagnosis of leucocytozoon caulleryi infection in commercial broiler breeders in South Korea#FTI#
#IRE#This report confirms a recent outbreak of a Leucocytozoon caulleryi infection in a commercial broiler breeder flock in South Korea. Seven, 18-day-old broiler breeders (Gallus gallus) were necropsied following a history of depression, sudden death, and subcutaneous hemorrhages. On necropsy, subcutaneous hemorrhages were identified in the wings and legs, pectoral and thigh muscles, thymus, epicardium, pancreas, and kidneys. On histopathology, there were numerous schizonts and merozoits of a Leucocytozoon sp. noted in the heart, spleen, liver, kidneys, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius. Molecular analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase b confirmed that the causative agent was Leucocytozoon caulleryi. Although L. caulleryi was diagnosed previously in South Korea, there had been no reports of L. caulleryi over the past several decades. Â© American Association of Avian Pathologists.#FRE#
