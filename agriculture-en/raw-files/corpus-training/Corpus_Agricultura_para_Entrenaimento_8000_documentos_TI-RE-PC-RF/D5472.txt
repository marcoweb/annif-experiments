#ITI#Absence of humoral response in flamingos and red-tailed hawks to experimental vaccination with a killed West Nile virus vaccine#FTI#
#IRE#Sixteen Chilean flamingos, Phoenicopterus chilensis, and 10 red-tailed hawks, Buteo jamacensis, were vaccinated in the pectoral muscle with 0.2 ml of a commercially produced killed West Nile virus vaccine intended for use in horses. Half the birds of each species received a booster vaccination 3 weeks after the first injection. Three weeks after the booster vaccination, none of 13 birds surveyed had detectable antibody to West Nile virus.#FRE#
