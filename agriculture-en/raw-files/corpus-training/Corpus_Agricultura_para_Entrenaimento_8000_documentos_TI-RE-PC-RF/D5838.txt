#ITI#MicroCT imaging as a tool to study vessel endings in situ#FTI#
#IRE#PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Despite the strong influence of the frequency and distribution of vessel endings on both hydraulic safety and efficiency, detailed anatomical descriptions or measurements of these structures are generally lacking. METHODS: Here we used high-resolution x-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) to identify and describe xylem vessel endings within Acer rubrum root segments (1.0–2.1 mm diameter, ~2 mm long). We then compared vessel-lumen diameter, pit density, vessel element length, and perforation plate angle between non-ending vessels (those that traverse an entire segment) and those that end within a segment using three-dimensional image analysis. KEY RESULTS: We found 214 vessel endings, 37 complete vessels, and 385 non-ending vessels within four A. rubrum root segments. Vessels that ended within the segments tended to have more acute perforation plate angles and had a smaller diameter than those that did not end within the segments. Most vessel diameters tapered within the last few vessel elements, but the perforation plate angle apparently changed over longer distances. Intervessel pit density and vessel element length did not differ between ending and non-ending vessels. CONCLUSIONS: Vessel endings were surprisingly frequent in A. rubrum roots despite the common perception that root vessels are longer than vessels in other tissues. MicroCT proved to be a useful tool for studying the three-dimensional arrangement of vessel endings within xylem networks, and these data will be helpful in developing a better understanding of vessel ending microstructure and function. © 2017 Botanical Society of America.#FRE#
