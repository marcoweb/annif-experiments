#ITI#Immunopathologic Investigations with an Attenuated Chicken Anemia Virus in Day-Old Chickens#FTI#
#IRE#The immunopathologic effects induced by two attenuated chicken anemia virus (CAV) isolates, known as cloned isolate 34 (CI 34) and cloned revenant isolate 18 (CRI 18), that were derived from highly passaged pools of Cux-1 CAV isolate, were compared with those induced by a pathogenic, molecularly cloned, low-passage Cux-1 isolate (CI Cux). This comparison involved the intramuscular inoculation of 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks with each of the viruses and investigation of birds at selected days postinoculation for gross pathology and depletions in the thymic T-cell populations as determined by flow cytometry. Whereas infection with the pathogenic CI Cux produced severe anemia and pronounced bone marrow and thymus lesions, infections with the attenuated CRI 18 and CI 34 isolates produced no anemia, no or mild lesions, respectively, and moderate T-cell depletion. The results suggest that, with CAV, reduced pathogenicity for 1-day-old chicks correlates with reduced depletion of T-cell populations in the thymus and with reduced severity of lesions in the thymus and bone marrow.#FRE#
