#ITI#Groundnut cultivation in semi-arid peninsular India for yield scaled nitrous oxide emission reduction#FTI#
#IRE#Studies reporting agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emission data from tropical upland crops or the climate adaptation and mitigation potential of farming practices that involve nutrient management and/or organic farming are very limited in number. We developed alternate groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) farming practices for rainfed kharif (South-west monsoon) and irrigated rabi (winter) cropping seasons for agro-ecological region 3.0 in semi-arid peninsular India; and compared their yields, farm income as well as nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions with current baseline practices among regional small scale farm-holders. At the study farm, alternate practices including application of locally prepared fermented manures along with a 40–60 % reduction in application of total N increased pod yield by 50 and 35 % and net profit by ~120 and ~70 % in a drought-hit kharif and an irrigated rabi, respectively. High resolution field measurements of N2O flux indicate that the seasonal emission factors for groundnut cultivation using baseline and alternate practices were 1.7–2.0 % of applied N. Thus, the average IPCC and Indian national emissions factors of 1 and 0.58 %, respectively, underestimate GHG emissions during groundnut cultivation. Crucially, alternate practices led to (1) a reduction of 0.13 ± 0.07 and 0.24 ± 0.1 tCO2e ha−1 season−1through decreases in direct N2O emissions along with a 50 % reduction in GHG emission intensity (per unit yield) in both seasons; (2) a concomitant average reduction of ~0.1 and 0.24 tCO2e ha−1 season−1through decreased demand for manufactured fertilizers in kharif and rabi seasons, respectively. The positive implications for climate resilience, mitigation and ecosystem services are discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.#FRE#
