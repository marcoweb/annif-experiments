#ITI#Hawaiian Island endemic and indigenous plant species have higher mycorrhizal incidence than the global average#FTI#
#IRE#Premise: Prior efforts have shown that continents harbor a greater proportion of mycorrhizal hosts than on islands. However, in the Hawaiian Islands, estimates of the proportion of mycorrhizal plant species are higher than on continents (>90%), but there are few studies to support this claim. Concurrently, Hawaii's flora faces some of the greatest global risks of extinction, and significant efforts are aimed at restoring native vegetation. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi have been shown to improve plant restoration success, but little work has been done in Hawaii to understand the extent of mycorrhizal associations among native plant populations. Methods: We surveyed 35 native Hawaiian plant species in the wild, focusing on plant species that are reared for reintroduction. Roots from wild individuals were collected from 10 sites on Oahu to determine degree of mycorrhizal fungal colonization and how this varies across host populations. Results: Of the species surveyed, 97% had evidence of mycorrhizal colonization, including 25 endemic and nine indigenous species from 23 families. The mycorrhizal status of 22 of the species surveyed was unknown before this study. For four species, the degree of colonization by AM fungi differed among sites, and these differences corresponded with variations in precipitation and temperature. Conclusions: The high incidence of mycorrhizal colonization provides evidence that island flora can actually harbor more mycorrhizal hosts than species on mainlands and that future reintroduction projects should consider the potentially important roles of AM fungi for success of these hosts in the wild. © 2021 Botanical Society of America#FRE#
