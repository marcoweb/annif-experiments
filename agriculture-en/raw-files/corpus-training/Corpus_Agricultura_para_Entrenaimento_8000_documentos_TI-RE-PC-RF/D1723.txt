#ITI#Gained net ecosystem economic benefit in machine-transplanted double-cropped rice strategies#FTI#
#IRE#Machine-transplanted rice with side-deep fertilization (MRSF) can partially compensate for the negative environmental impacts of traditional rice cultivation methods. However, its effects on net ecosystem economic benefit, greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon footprint have not been extensively assessed. We conducted a two-season field experiment to investigate the effects of MRSF in paddy fields on greenhouse gas emissions, global warming potential, carbon footprint, grain yield, and net ecosystem economic benefit. Six treatments with different N application rates (0/0, 90/99, 105/116, 120/132, 135/149, and 150/165 kg N ha−1) were applied to early season rice and late-season rice. The results indicated that under MRSF, soil CH4 and N2O emissions were significantly lower (by 13.2–45.6% and 5.4–28.7% in early season rice and 21.3–42.3% and 19.1–35.6% in late-season rice, respectively) than those under conventional fertilization. Chemical fertilizer was the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural inputs for the early season and late-season rice. Additionally, MRSF mitigated soil CH4 and N2O emissions and ultimately reduced the total greenhouse gas emissions. The net ecosystem economic benefit of MRSF was significantly higher (by 16.3–25.7% and 23.4–29.7% for the early season and late-season rice, respectively) than that under conventional fertilization. Overall, MRSF is an economically beneficial approach with low environmental impact for commercial rice cultivation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.#FRE#
