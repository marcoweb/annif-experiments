#ITI#Devising a cyber security management module through integrated course design#FTI#
#IRE#Cyber security is a growing area of international importance, with shortages present for cyber security skills. While many universities have introduced degree programmes for cyber security, the major focus of these programmes is on the development of technical skills with some reports indicating how graduates of these courses lack in softer skills and business acumen. However, cyber security management is a topic area where students can develop such skills. This paper presents the pedagogical and assessment approaches used for cyber security management education, and presents a case study of developing a ‘Cyber Security Management’ module of study through utilising Finks’ Integrated Course Design. This paper presents the findings that active learning approaches are effective methods for teaching this subject area, which include the use of decision-making scenario tasks, group projects, and tasking students with conducting a management report for a real company, where they should conduct interviews with the organisation#FRE#
