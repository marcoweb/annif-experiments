#ITI#Technology addiction, abduction and adoption in higher education: Bird's eye view of the ICT4AD policy in Ghana 20 years on#FTI#
#IRE# Twenty years after its inauguration, the information communication and technology for accelerated development (ICT4AD) policy intended to transform Ghana into an information and technology-driven high-income economy through digital education has been unsuccessful. In this digital era, young adults' attachment to technological tools is anticipated to expedite technological adoption in the education sector. Still, there are less promising indicators of realizing this expectation because of situational factors that curtail technology usage and adoption in higher education (HE). It is estimated that the adoption of technology in HE will aid Ghana in using ICT as its engine of growth. This paper gauges the progress of the ICT4AD policy after two decades, presents an intricate account of why technology integration in HE in Ghana is still in its infancy and proposes interventions for sustaining and advancing the objectives of the ICT4AD policy. Drawing from an extensive review of literature on three conceptualized thematic themes relating to technology (ie, addiction, abduction and adoption), policymakers in education and stakeholders in HE will be able to identify their roles in guaranteeing the success of the promulgated ICT4AD policy. Viable areas of research are also discussed in the study. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? The promulgated information communication and technology for accelerated development (ICT4AD) policy of Ghana hopes to transform the country into a technology-driven economy. Technology integration in education and society is still in its infancy in Ghana in this information age. What this paper adds? It gauges the progress of the ICT4AD policy and presents an intricate account of why technology integration in HE in Ghana is still in its infancy and proposes interventions for sustaining and advancing the objectives of the ICT4AD policy. It sounds the alarm that the ICT4AD policy is at its terminal stage and calls on policymakers in education to revisit and revise the policy. It identifies the main factors curtailing effective technology integration in Ghana. It suggests promising steps for Ghana to adopt technology as its engine of growth. Implications of this study for practice and/or policy It provides information to education practitioners and relevant school stakeholders on how to effectively adopt technology to develop 21st-century skills among learners. It explores the potential channels for policymakers in education to revisit and reinvest in the ICT4AD policy for the successful attainment of the policy objectives. It calls on countries with similar contexts like Ghana to adopt a multifaceted approach to drive ICT initiatives#FRE#
