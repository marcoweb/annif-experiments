#ITI#Measurement of student attitudes to science and association with inquiry-based learning in regional schools#FTI#
#IRE#An inquiry approach to learning can have a positive impact on students’ attitudes to science and their science literacy skills; two attributes that have been in steady decline internationally. The professional development of teachers in inquiry science is one way to ensure that teachers are equipped with effective strategies to teach science, particularly in non-metropolitan schools where development opportunities may be limited, and students’ attitudes to science are typically less positive than in metropolitan schools. Consequently, this study measured the attitudes to science and science self-efficacy of 133 school students aged 10–15 years from six non-metropolitan schools in Queensland, Australia, and explored the association with teachers’ professional development in inquiry science. A survey instrument demonstrating good psychometric properties was derived to measure three components of students’ multidimensional attitudes to science: acceptance of an inquiry approach to science, enjoyment of science lessons and career-interest in science. Findings showed that students’ attitudes to science and science self-efficacy differed significantly among schools. Teachers’ implementation of inquiry pedagogy in these schools was also varied. Students’ acceptance of inquiry science, enjoyment of science, career-interest in science and self-efficacy were positively correlated and evident in classrooms that employed a collaborative inquiry approach to teaching science#FRE#
