The goal was to discern the relationships among service learning, social insights, academics, personal insights, and civic responsibility within a multivariate framework that synthesized literatures regarding how underrepresented and misrepresented college students define their own success, and the development of civic engagement for similarly situated youth. Through path analytic modeling techniques, four models were assessed. In the retained model, social insights play a pivotal role, mediating the relation between service learning and academic outcomes, personal insights, and civic responsibility, with academic outcomes and personal insights also mediating the relation between social insights and personal responsibilit#FRE#
