#ITI#Integration of ICTs in teaching practices: propositions to the SAMR model#FTI#
#IRE# This article aims to analyze the experiences of teachers on the uses of ICTs in the development of teaching practices within the framework of a new learning ecology. We use the SAMR model to scale the levels of ICTs contributions in each practice. 116 teachers from a public educational institution in Brazil answered a questionnaire during the pandemic scenario, while conducting emergency remote teaching. Teachers declared to develop the teaching practices with the integration of ICTs at the levels of Augmentation and Modification by correspondence to the SAMR model. Based on the analyzes carried out, we propose some reflections that help to rethink this model and to understand the second-order barriers that prevent the effective integration of ICT in teachers’ practices#FRE#
