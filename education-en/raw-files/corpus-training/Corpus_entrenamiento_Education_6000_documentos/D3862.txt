#ITI#Screen Time Policy in Alberta Childcare Centres#FTI#
#IRE#Increasing amounts of screen time among young children has become a growing concern. Childcare centres maybe one important setting to intervene. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of screen time and screen time policies within childcare centres as well as the association between these policies and screen time among toddlers (19–35 months) and preschoolers (36–60 months). Directors (n = 238) of childcare centres in Alberta, Canada completed a brief questionnaire. The median weekly screen time for toddlers and preschoolers was 0 min/week. However, many centres were still providing screen time (Toddlers: 22%; Preschoolers: 47%). About a third of centres did not have a written screen time policy in place. Centres with a written screen time policy and more policy topics had a lower likelihood of providing no screen time compared to centres without a policy or less policy topics. In the future, targeted interventions may be needed for centres providing undesirable amounts of screen time to children. Such interventions should consider implementing resources to support the translation of policy into practice or the translation of practice into policy#FRE#
