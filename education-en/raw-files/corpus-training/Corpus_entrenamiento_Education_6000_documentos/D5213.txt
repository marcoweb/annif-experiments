#ITI#Is It Possible to Bring the Past into the Present for an Effective History of Mathematics Teaching: Newspaper Preparation Method#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, it was aimed to experiment a new method to increase the quality of the history of mathematics course instruction in the primary mathematics education. The method composed by synthesizing project-based and collaborative learning methods was named “Newspaper Preparation Method,” and the course was delivered using this method. Exploratory design, one of the mixed methods in which qualitative and quantitative techniques are both used, was applied in the study. The sample of the study consists of 35 undergraduate students studying in the primary mathematics education department. The quantitative data analyzed through SPSS-25 while qualitative data analyzed through content analysis. The results of data analysis revealed that the pre-service teachers held positive attitudes towards the method. Also, participants realized that they gained skills such as proactivity, research, inquiry, reproductivity, authorship, teamwork, and socializing. Besides, pre-service teachers’ prejudices were eliminated against the course, their motivation increased, their curiosity was triggered, and most importantly the pre-service teachers deemed themselves important. Moreover, this method has transformed the course from a boring program into an exciting and enjoyable part of the syllabus. Finally, pre-service teachers stated that they learned the class effectively and permanently, their vocabulary and general knowledge increased, and their computer literacy improved. It is predicted that this study will contribute to the literature through analyzing a hands-on method and inspire those teaching the history of mathematics#FRE#
