#ITI#The teaching of Indigenous knowledge and perspectives in initial teacher education: a scoping review of empirical studies#FTI#
#IRE#This scoping review examines the literature on teaching Indigenous knowledge and perspectives in Initial Teacher Education (ITE) programmes. The study explores how these programmes integrate Indigenous knowledge and perspectives into their curriculum and pedagogy to prepare teachers to work with Indigenous students and communities. The review identifies empirical studies focusing on the experiences of ITE students, faculty, and Indigenous knowledge keepers, highlighting common themes and best practices. The findings suggest that while many ITE programmes have incorporated Indigenous knowledge and perspectives into their curriculum, there is a need for greater attention to the pedagogical approaches used to teach this knowledge. There is also a need for programmes to build stronger relationships with Indigenous communities and to ensure that Indigenous knowledge is taught by teachers/educators who have received some training in consultations with the Indigenous knowledge keepers. The study highlights the importance of ongoing reflection and evaluation of ITE programmes to ensure that they are preparing the preservice teachers confident enough to embed Indigenous content in their teaching and, at the same time, meet the needs of Indigenous students and communities#FRE#
