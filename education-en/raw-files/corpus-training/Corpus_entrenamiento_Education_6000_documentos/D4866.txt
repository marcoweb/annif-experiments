#ITI#Facilitators and Barriers of Implementation of Evidence-Based Parenting Support in Educational Settings#FTI#
#IRE#Improving child behavior and promoting family well-being is a key objective of evidence-based parenting programs, such as the Triple P–Positive Parenting Program. To achieve this goal, parenting programs are delivered using a multidisciplinary workforce. Previous researchers have collectively examined the entire workforce of parenting practitioners to determine the factors that influence program delivery, primarily using self-report measures. However, these findings did not highlight the unique factors relevant to specific practitioner disciplines. Educators are one practitioner discipline that play an integral role in delivering parenting programs through schools and early childhood learning settings. This study aimed at exploring the facilitators and barriers that impact frequency of program use for educator practitioners using both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Data from 404 Triple P educator practitioners were extracted from a larger dataset of 1202 practitioners from English-speaking countries who completed self-report questionnaires and responded to three open-ended questions. Hierarchical multiple regressions were conducted using eight independent variables (with participant characteristics as control variables), revealing seven positive and one negative predictor for frequency of use. A thematic analysis was then conducted on the qualitative responses, producing 11 themes and 28 subthemes. The quantitative analysis revealed organisational support, perceived usefulness, and practitioner self-regulation were the most important positive predictors. The qualitative analysis supported these findings and revealed novel barriers including Covid-19/work from home, online delivery, parent factors, and specific organisational factors. These findings highlight the need for online resources, reliable virtual delivery methods, improved ways to reach and engage families, and additional trained education practitioners to distribute high workloads. © Crown 2024.#FRE#
