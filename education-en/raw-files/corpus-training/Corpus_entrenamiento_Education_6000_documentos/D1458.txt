#ITI#A longitudinal study of foreign language anxiety and enjoyment#FTI#
#IRE# The present longitudinal study investigated the changes of FLE (foreign language enjoyment) and FLA (foreign language anxiety) over time in the foreign language classroom and their relationship with foreign language learning motivation and learners’ personality traits. Fifty-five college students completed an FLE/FLA questionnaire after English classes over 14 weeks. They also completed a motivation questionnaire and a personality questionnaire. The results revealed that FLE was less stable over time as compared to FLA. A number of motivational factors (e.g. ought-to L2 self, ideal L2 self, motivated behavior) were found to be related to both the mean and the variance of FLE and FLA over time. Moreover, several personality traits (e.g. extraversion) also played a role in FLE and FLA. Pedagogical implications were discussed.#FRE#
