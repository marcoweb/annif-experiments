#ITI#Developing faculty EdTech instructional decision-making competence with principles for the integration of EdTech#FTI#
#IRE# Future success for online teaching can be described in terms of competencies, the knowledge, skills, and affect and motivation that as component parts undergird successful performance, or in terms of competence, the behaviors that demonstrate ability to perform in an online setting. Either framing could aid higher education to consider how to foster online teaching excellence. Yet, considering this dichotomy instead as a continuum emphasizes a fruitful point in between to target for faculty professional learning. This linking, middle view, emphasizes the processes faculty use to recognize what the situation demands and make decisions about what to do and operationalize competencies into competence. This concept paper presents a set of conceptual principles that can serve as guidance to organize faculty decision making when integrating EdTech into higher education courses. Drawing on an existing dataset of interview data from two studies of faculty learning to integrate a new EdTech, instructors’ experiences with each principle are illustrated. This provides opportunities to see how faculty organized decisions aligned with the principles and how faculty needs were met when principles described the project’s support conditions. This approach shows how universities could benefit from framing EdTech support in terms of embedding representations to first build, then guide, technical and pedagogical knowledge and skill. Providing guiding principles may then motivate faculty to acquire and assemble those competencies in context-sensitive ways for instructional decision making#FRE#
