#ITI#Identifying the components of effective learner-centred feedback information#FTI#
#IRE#Due to recent conceptual shifts towards learner-centred feedback, there is a potential gap between research and practice. Indeed, few models or studies have sought to identify or evaluate which semantic messages, or feedback components, teachers should include in learner-centred feedback comments. Instead, teacher practices are likely to be primarily shaped by ‘old paradigm’ conceptualisations of feedback. In response, the current study develops a taxonomy of learner-centred feedback components based on a rapid systematic review of the literature. The face, content and construct validity of the taxonomy are then established through an empirical study with teachers and students at two Australian universities. The outcome of this study is a conceptual model featuring eight learner-centred feedback components. This model will help teachers design effective feedback processes and support learners to make sense of and use feedback information to improve their future work and learning strategies#FRE#
