#ITI#Supporting Student System Modelling Practice Through Curriculum and Technology Design#FTI#
#IRE# Developing and using models to make sense of phenomena or to design solutions to problems is a key science and engineering practice. Classroom use of technology-based tools can promote the development of students’ modelling practice, systems thinking, and causal reasoning by providing opportunities to develop and use models to explore phenomena. In previous work, we presented four aspects of system modelling that emerged during our development and initial testing of an online system modelling tool. In this study, we provide an in-depth examination and detailed evidence of 10th grade students engaging in those four aspects during a classroom enactment of a system modelling unit. We look at the choices students made when constructing their models, whether they described evidence and reasoning for those choices, and whether they described the behavior of their models in connection with model usefulness in explaining and making predictions about the phenomena of interest. We conclude with a set of recommendations for designing curricular materials that leverage digital tools to facilitate the iterative constructing, using, evaluating, and revising of models#FRE#
