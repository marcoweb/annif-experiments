#ITI#Populating the science-policy co-production space: academic and policymaker perspectives on knowledge exchange#FTI#
#IRE# In this paper, we seek to provide a fresh perspective on knowledge exchange by addressing both academics’ and policymakers’ experiences with such exchange. Through two large Norwegian surveys of academics and policymakers, we look at the characteristics of the academics that are engaged in various forms of knowledge exchange with policymakers–and vice versa–as well as the channels and mechanisms of knowledge exchange seen from both sides. Through comparing the patterns that emerge in the two studies, we discuss how this exchange arena, which we conceptualise as a ‘co-production space’ involves a small number of individuals with similar experiences and practices that set them apart from their peers#FRE#
