#ITI#Overview of the implementation of a 30-year programme on environmental and sustainability education in Spain#FTI#
#IRE#Over the past 30 years, ‘Aldea’ (global village), the Education for Environmental and Sustainability (ESE) School Programme has been implemented in over one thousand public schools in Andalusia, Southern Spain. The present study analyses the beliefs of a group of teacher coordinators who have experience of implementing the Aldea programme in their schools with the aim of improving awareness of sustainability. Using data from 13 teachers who participated in regional focus groups, we analysed their beliefs towards the programme, their views of the perceived impact of the programme, and the common drivers and barriers related to the programme. Findings point to the need for a Whole School Approach in order to avoid the typical challenges associated with the implementation of such a programme, in particular teacher burnout. Finally, implications for the successful incorporation of ESE school programmes and subsequent effective practices are discussed#FRE#
