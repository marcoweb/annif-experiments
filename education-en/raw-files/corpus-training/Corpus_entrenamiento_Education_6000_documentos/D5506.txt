#ITI#Negative instructor communication behaviours: exploring associations between instructor misbehaviours and the classroom learning environment#FTI#
#IRE#Given the array of positive outcomes associated with building and maintaining a positive learning environment, the purpose of this study was to explore associations between student perceptions of the classroom learning environment and perceived instructor’s misbehaviours. Several dimensions of the learning environment were found to be associated with how students viewed instructor misbehaviours. These findings provide another unique perspective on the importance of instructor’s communication behaviours and how they can influence students’ overall impressions of the learning environment#FRE#
