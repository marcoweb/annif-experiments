#ITI#Vibe Check: A 360-degree Enumeration of the Common Features of a University Makerspace#FTI#
#IRE#To better grasp the issue of underrepresentation in makerspaces, it's crucial to closely examine the environment where these problems arise. A spatial enumeration of a makerspace, which is a complete listing of items within a collection or environment, extends such an evaluation. By responding to this overarching research question, “why do students from underrepresented communities turn away at the threshold of a makerspace,” this article provides findings from the first phase of a five-year, qualitative research program. Specifically, this paper presents the sensory features (sight, sound, smell) that comprise a university makerspace. The process and findings from enumerating a makerspace offer vital insights into how STEM-focused environments convey inclusivity. Seventeen makerspace leaders from a university network were asked to discern what a typical makerspace looks, sounds, and smells like. The findings from this study provide information professionals with entry points to analyze their makerspace from a DEI standpoint. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2023.#FRE#
