#ITI#Nanolearning approach in developing professional competencies of modern students: Impact on self-regulation development#FTI#
#IRE# Nanolearning represents an educational methodology rooted in personalisation and the individualisation of the educational process, leveraging contemporary information technologies. Nanolearning, closely intertwined with self-regulated learning, entails an individual's capacity to plan, monitor and regulate their learning process, objectives and strategies. In nanolearning, information is presented in small, discrete fragments, necessitating students to autonomously manage their time and educational progress, thereby determining when and what to study. Nanolearning and TikTok can synergistically intersect, yielding innovative pedagogical approaches. TikTok, a popular social platform for sharing concise video clips, introduces a novel mode of information dissemination and interpersonal communication. Background: The introduction of a flexible education system that meets the individual requirements of a student is a burning need of our time. The study hypothesis is as follows: Will nanolearning be able to change the self-regulatory competence of the experiment participants and how exactly?. Objectives: The current study aimed to determine nanolearning effectiveness in the context of students' self-regulation development. Methods: This was done using a self-regulation questionnaire addressed to a sample of 120 students of the Kokshetau University named after A. Myrzakhmetov. As a nanolearning platform, this study benefited from the TikTok app. Results: The results showed that the experimental group achieved significantly higher scores than the control group on goal setting, environmental structuring, task strategies, time management, help-seeking and self-evaluation. Conclusions: The results obtained can help develop a set of activities for the optimisation of the educational process to improve student professional competence#FRE#
