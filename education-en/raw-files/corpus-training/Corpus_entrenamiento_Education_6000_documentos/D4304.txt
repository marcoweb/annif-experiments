#ITI#The preparation of novice teacher educators for critical, justice-oriented teacher education: A longitudinal exploration of formal study in the pedagogy of teacher education#FTI#
#IRE#There continues to be limited focus on the preparation of teacher educators, particularly for teacher education aimed at challenging educational inequities. This case study explores the impact of a curricular approach to preparing novice teacher educators in the pedagogy of teacher education. Drawing on surveys, interviews, documents, and observations of practice, the study traces what novice teacher educators learned 5 years after enrolment in a doctoral course, and how this learning shaped their teacher education practice over time. The analysis illuminates conceptual and practical tools as well as unanticipated learning that were salient for novice teacher educators’ learning and practice#FRE#
