#ITI#Examining the relationship of depression and anxiety to academic entitlement, and the potential mediating role of mindfulness#FTI#
#IRE#Higher Educational Institutions across disciplines have seen an increased number of students who are highly distressed over grades, and this distress is often accompanied by pervasive demands on academic staff. The current study explored the relationship between academic entitlement and mental health and how it is mediated by mindfulness. Participants completed three scales (academic entitlement, depression anxiety and stress, and mindfulness). Results showed that as symptoms of depression and anxiety increase, academic entitlement increases. Furthermore, this relationship is mediated by acting with awareness, a facet of mindfulness. Findings from the current study support the use of mindfulness interventions in potentially disrupting the link between academic entitlement and mental ill-health. Future directions are discussed#FRE#
