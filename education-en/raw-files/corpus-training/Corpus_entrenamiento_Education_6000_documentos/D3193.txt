#ITI#Defining Learning Experience Design: Voices from the Field of Learning Design & Technology#FTI#
#IRE#Increasing interest in user experience design (UXD) in the field of learning design and technology (LDT) signals a growing recognition of the importance of the individual experience of using learning technologies to learning—the learner experience (LX). However, a need exists to better define and conceptualize the phenomenon of learning experience design (LXD). Imprecise, interchangeable, and reductive usage of terms and concepts related to LXD frustrates efforts to situate and connect the established traditions of our field with complimentary methods and processes external to LDT (e.g., UXD, human-computer interaction). To approach this need, we performed qualitative content analysis on a corpus of 15 chapters from a recently published edited volume focused specifically on LXD in the field of LDT. Our research questions focused on identifying key terms and concepts, exploring how chapter authors characterized LXD, and examining the perspectives that informed authors’ conceptions of LXD. We approached these questions using a rigorous, multi-phase inquiry process in which we conducted systematic, iterative open-coding. These coding efforts led to the emergence of a rich tapestry of terminology, methods, and concepts associated with LXD. Importantly, while book chapter authors drew from outside the field of LDT, the manner in which they intentionally located their work within established traditions of this field was particularly revealing. Grounded in the voices of these researchers and practitioners, we assert that LXD is a human-centric, theoretically-grounded, and socio-culturally sensitive approach to learning design, intended to propel learners towards identified learning goals, and informed by UXD methods. On the basis of this operational definition, directions for future research are proposed#FRE#
