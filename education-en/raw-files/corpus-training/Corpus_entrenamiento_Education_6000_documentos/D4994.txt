#ITI#Examining Race and Racism in Black Men Doctoral Student Socialization: A Critical Race Mixed Methods Analysis#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study was to explore the socialization experiences of Black men doctoral students in the United States, using critical race theory as a theoretical and methodological framework. Specifically, we sought to understand the role of race and racism in Black men doctoral students’ socialization experiences; how race, racism, and other factors influence their academic and social experiences in graduate school; and the meaning they make of these racialized experiences. Quantitative and qualitative findings from this study coalesce as composite counterstories of Black men in doctoral programs, offering insight the pervasiveness of racism in graduate education#FRE#
