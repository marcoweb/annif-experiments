#ITI#The four pillars: the architecture of the government school in Australia 1835-1885#FTI#
#IRE#The government school has held an integral part in the Australian idea of progressive society, a locus of community definition and pride that is the backbone of social infrastructure. Yet, it took decades from the establishment of the Australian British colonies from 1788 to establish a system of general education. The Australian school had modest beginnings, founded on the Irish National School system in the 1840s. This paper examines the architecture of Australian government schools between 1835–1885, charting the evolution of their design including the use and development of common plans, the influence of rules and regulations, and their position in a civil society#FRE#
