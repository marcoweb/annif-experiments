#ITI#Exploring the Learning Process of Experienced Teachers Focused on Building Positive Interactions with Pupils#FTI#
#IRE#This work investigated the processes of teacher informal learning focused on building positive teacher–pupil interaction. The conceptual framework “Teacher professional agency for learning” was merged with the “Teaching through interaction” model to compound the exploratory framework of this study: Teachers learn by interacting. Teachers first reported their professional agency through a survey. Next, five high scoring teachers were selected for interview. Final participants accounted being motivated and confident of improving their relationships with pupils and reported using diverse learning strategies to improve teacher–pupil interactions. The teachers revealed the need to be authentic to build positive relationships with pupils. This study contributes to the area of teacher learning by addressing transferable strategies that support everyday teacher practices and professional development#FRE#
