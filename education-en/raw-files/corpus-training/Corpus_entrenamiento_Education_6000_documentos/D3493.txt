#ITI#Predictors of employment for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities participating in a postsecondary transition program in the United States#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Previous research has shown that post-secondary collegiate vocational educational programs often have positive effects on employment outcomes for young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Aims: Using secondary data of a program in the United States collected over several years, we examined which intervention components of a postsecondary education transition program predicted subsequent employment for young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Materials & Methods: The sample consisted of 56 individuals that participated in a transition-services collegiate program; Crossing Points, University of Alabama. Results: Results were able to robustly indicate that acquiring job-specific skills was a much better predictor than global measures of intellectual or adaptive behaviour. Additionally, survival curve analyses as an innovative approach to this population showed that there was a positive relation between the number of job-specific training sessions and eventual community employment. Discussion: Results are discussed in relation to a historical parallel movement to expand inclusion of students with intellectual and developmental disabilities in the least restrictive educational setting for primary and secondary public education years. Conclusion: In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest positive findings with job-skills training both specific and general#FRE#
