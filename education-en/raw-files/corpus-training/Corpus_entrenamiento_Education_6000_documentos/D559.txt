#ITI#College Is …: Focusing on the College Knowledge of Gang-Associated Latino Young Men#FTI#
#IRE# Research shows that gang-associated youth are less likely to complete high school and earn a postsecondary educational credential. However, scholars have not determined “why” gang youth do not persist into higher education. This ethnographic study aims to focus on the narratives of 13 Latino high school young men to understand what college knowledge they possess. We found the students have aspirations to pursue postsecondary education degrees or credentials; however, they receive minimal information and support from school personnel to build the needed college-going behaviors and information to plan and prepare for higher education.#FRE#
