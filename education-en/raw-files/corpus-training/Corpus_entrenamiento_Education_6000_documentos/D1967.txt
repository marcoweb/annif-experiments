#ITI#A Toolbox for Understanding the Dynamics of Small Group Discussions#FTI#
#IRE# This work considers group discussion data, as recorded in video conferencing settings, and demonstrates the ability to use readily available computational tools to glean important information characterizing the dynamics of the group discussion. In particular, our toolbox reveals a number of important characteristics of a discussion, including who is speaking when and each participant’s relative sentiment throughout the discussion. We also identify the moments of the discussion where specific events occur, such as reading or quoting from source material or when questions are being asked, etc. Finally, we conduct a topic analysis to characterize the amount of time spent on various themes in the discussion. We then demonstrate that these tools are reasonably accurate at locating the desired content and can, in fact, provide a unique window to into the dynamics of group discussions. © International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society 2023.#FRE#
