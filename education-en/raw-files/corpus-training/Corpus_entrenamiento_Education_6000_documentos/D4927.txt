#ITI#Exploring Faculty and Staff Development of Cultural Competence Through Communicative Learning in an Online Diversity Course#FTI#
#IRE#Given that racial and ethnic minorities will comprise the majority of the U.S. demographic population by the 2050s, it is imperative that faculty and staff develop a level of cultural competence to effectively provide all students with a well-rounded classroom learning experience suitable for an increasingly diverse workforce. Previous research has suggested online learning as one effective way to engage university faculty and staff in their development of cultural competence in spite of time and resources constraints. However, little is known about the types of communicative processes in computer-mediated learning spaces that allow for transformative learning. In this qualitative research study, we draw on Mezirow’s transformative learning theory to explore how cultural competence is developed as faculty and staff interact and share stories about their experiences, perspectives, and beliefs in relation to other racial and ethnic groups. A key finding in our study is that faculty and staff reported having a better understanding of unconscious bias, microaggressions, and privilege, as well as a desire to take action to help ensure a more inclusive environment in their professional and personal spheres of influence. This study yields valuable insights for academics, diversity and inclusion educators, and practitioners alike#FRE#
