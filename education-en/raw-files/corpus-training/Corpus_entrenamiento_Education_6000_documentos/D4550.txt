#ITI#First-year university students' knowledge of academic misconduct and the association between goals for attending university and receptiveness to intervention#FTI#
#IRE#Academic misconduct (AM) runs rampant across higher education institutions in the US and internationally. Ample empirical research has identified myriad student variables that predict AM. However, two variables have been unexamined: the quality of conceptual knowledge university students have on AM and the relation between goals for going to university and reception to intervention on AM. Quantitative content analysis on written responses by 356 first-year university students reported surface-level knowledge of AM, frequent citation of extrinsic goals, and a lack of association between goals and receptiveness to intervention. Results corroborate prior research on university students' limited understanding of AM. Results suggest that efforts to address AM do not need to tailor intervention components to match students' goals for attending university#FRE#
