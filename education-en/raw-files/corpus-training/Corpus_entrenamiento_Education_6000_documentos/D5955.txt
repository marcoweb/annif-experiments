#ITI#Exploring the role of HE teachers as change agents in the reconstruction of post-conflict Syria#FTI#
#IRE#This article explores Syrian higher education (HE) teachers’ perceptions of their role as change agents in the reconstruction of post-conflict Syria. It utilises the notions of ‘change agent’ and ‘strategic competence’ (previously developed in relation to academics by Idahosa and Vincent) for exploring HE teachers’ capacity to contribute to the post-conflict reconstruction of Syria. This article is based on a small-scale, qualitative study using in-depth interviews to explore the experiences and perspectives of HE teachers who have been working at a conflict-affected university for the duration of the conflict. The study concludes that HE teachers may be considered change agents in post-conflict societies, but that the challenges these teachers face must be taken into account, as must considerations of how the institution and the HE system can facilitate teachers in their change-making remit#FRE#
