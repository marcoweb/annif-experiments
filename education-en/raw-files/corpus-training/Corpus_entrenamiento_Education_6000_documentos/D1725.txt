#ITI#Towards a fuller picture: Triangulation and integration of the measurement of self-regulated learning based on trace and think aloud data#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Many learners struggle to productively self-regulate their learning. To support the learners' self-regulated learning (SRL) and boost their achievement, it is essential to understand the cognitive and metacognitive processes that underlie SRL. To measure these processes, contemporary SRL researchers have largely utilized think aloud or trace data, however, not without challenges. Objectives: In this paper, we present the findings of a study that investigated how concurrent analysis and integration of think aloud and trace data could advance the measurement of SRL and assist in better understanding the mechanisms of SRL processes, especially those details that remain obscured by observing each data channel individually. Methods: We concurrently collected think aloud and trace data generated by 44 university students in a laboratory setting and analysed those data relative to the same timeline. Results: We found that the two data channels could be interchangeably used to measure SRL processes for only 17.18% of all the time segments identified in a learning task. Moreover, SRL processes for around 45% of all the time segments could be detected via either trace data or think aloud data. For another 27.17% of all the time segments, different SRL processes were detected in both data channels. Conclusions: Our results largely suggest that the two data collection methods can be used to complement each other in measuring SRL. In particular, we found that think aloud and trace data could provide different perspectives on SRL. The integration of the two methods further allowed us to reveal a more complex and more comprehensive temporal associations among SRL processes compared to using a single data collection method. In future research, the integrated measurement of SRL can be used to improve the detection of SRL processes and provide a fuller picture of SRL#FRE#
