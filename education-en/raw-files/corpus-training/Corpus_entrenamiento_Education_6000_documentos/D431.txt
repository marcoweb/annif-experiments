#ITI#Trauma and resilience in the lives and education of Hmong American students: forging pedagogies of remembrance with critical refugee discourse#FTI#
#IRE# Since 1975, over 3 million refugees have entered the United States, yet schools are unequipped to recognize and comprehend refugee communities’ life circumstances as shaped by structural and symbolic violence. The educational experiences of second-generation Hmong American refugees highlight this neglect and its potential consequences for intergenerational relationships. Articulating a critical remembering framework, this narrative analysis examined how Hmong American college students memorialized, authenticated, and drew connections between historical trauma and contemporary racial violence through a cultural show production. The findings illustrate how addressing war, race, and class within the context of education can disrupt silence around historical trauma and racial oppression in the United States and make possible a transformative education. This study has relevance for educational institutions, especially in a context of global migrations due to conflicts that inflict mass violence, which spans the material and symbolic landscapes of refugee lives#FRE#
