#ITI#Concerns about teaching culturally diverse students in a cross-disciplinary sample of higher education faculty#FTI#
#IRE#I examined concerns surrounding teaching culturally diverse students held by a cross-disciplinary sample of higher education faculty at a major Midwestern university in the United States. Findings indicated as faculty levels of acceptance of culturally diverse students increased, negative faculty attitudes toward these students decreased, as did faculty concerns that these students might hold negative perceptions toward them. A greater acceptance of culturally diverse students was also associated with a faculty assigning greater importance to incorporating content regarding cultural diversity into their courses, and spending more time discussing diversity issues in class. Faculty identified chief barriers concerning the incorporation of diversity issues into their course content as: (1) not finding diversity issues relevant to their course content; (2) time constraints; and, (3) student apprehension about faculty including diversity content in courses#FRE#
