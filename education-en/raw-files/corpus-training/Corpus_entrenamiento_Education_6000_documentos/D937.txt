#ITI#Technology-Enhanced Learning and Its Association with Motivation to Learn Science from a Cross-Cultural Perspective#FTI#
#IRE# Fostering technology-enhanced science learning in elementary schools is an ongoing challenge as young students are not always motivated to engage with science lessons. The use of technology, such as digital sensors and data recorders, has been found to result in higher engagement with science. However, the association between technology-enhanced science learning and students’ motivation to learn, from a cross-cultural viewpoint, is still discussed among researchers. Thus, the goal of this study was twofold: (a) to examine the motivation to learn science of elementary school students from different countries and cultural backgrounds; (b) to identify phases of technology-enhanced science learning and their association with students’ motivation. Applying the sequential mixed-methods research design, data were collected via questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and online observations. The study included seven experienced science teachers from the USA and Israel and 109 sixth-grade students: English speakers (N = 43), Arabic speakers (N = 26), and Hebrew speakers (N = 40). The findings indicated differences in students’ internal motivation, in terms of “interest and enjoyment,” “connection to daily-life,” and “cross-cultural interactions,” with medium ratings for “self-efficacy.” The study identified and characterized two consecutive phases of technology-enhanced science learning—“divergence” and “convergence”—that can be associated with motivation to learn science. Overall, the study’s results highlight the importance of seamlessly embedding technology to support cross-cultural learning of scientific practices#FRE#
