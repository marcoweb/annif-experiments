#ITI#Why learning environment matters? An analysis on how the learning environment influences the academic motivation, learning strategies and engagement of college students#FTI#
#IRE#The current work focused on how the learning environment of college students influenced their academic motivation, choice of learning strategies, and level of engagement in the classroom. The study is important because these variables are known to contribute to student achievement and success. Using a cross-sectional predictive design, a total of 1002 college students participated in the research by answering four standardized scales (college and university classroom environment inventory, academic motivation scale, motivated strategies for learning questionnaire and student course engagement questionnaire). The learning environment was positively related to college students’ academic motivation [F (9,1001) = 14.645, R2 =.117, p <.05], [F (9,1001) = 21.202, R2 =.161, p <.05], the choice of learning strategies [F (9,1001) = 11.268, R2 =.093, p <.05], [F (9,1001) = 21.738, R2 =.165, p <.05] and the level of student engagement [F (9,1001) = 17.350, R2 =.136, p <.05]#FRE#
