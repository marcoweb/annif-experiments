#ITI#Iterative Design and Integration of a Microlearning Mobile App for Performance Improvement and Support for NATO Employees#FTI#
#IRE#This case study details microlearning content development, testing, and implementation of the NATO Headquarters Supreme Allied Command Transformation (HQ SACT) e-Learning Networking App (NeNA) conducted by an AECT microlearning consulting team. NeNA was designed to provide microlearning “just-in-time” content, to create socialization (affinity spaces), channel organizational content, and increase employee motivation. The purpose of the AECT and HQ SACT partnership was to test the NeNA app as a viable way to develop and deliver microlearning content that personalizes self-directed learning, reduces cognitive load, meets the changing needs of the younger workforce, and captures implicit knowledge of employees prior to the end of their military duties. Primary lessons learned surrounded the importance of practitioner awareness of organizational and contextual challenges, including usability of solutions and essential steps to onboarding (training and integration), when adopting mobile learning solutions to provide performance support and improvement to employees#FRE#
