#ITI#Who wants to be a computer scientist? The computing aspirations of students in English secondary schools#FTI#
#IRE#Despite being in a digital age, the diversity of young people choosing to study and work in computing is of ongoing concern, especially low numbers of girls. This paper aims to determine the profile of students who are more likely to aspire to be computer scientists and provide insights into the key factors that shape their aspirations in this area. We draw on questionnaire data from 4,983 secondary school students in England, in schools that have a higher-than-average uptake of GCSE Computer Science (a national exam taken by students at age 16). Amongst students who have chosen to study GCSE Computer Science, girls have a lower odds of aspiring to be a Computer Scientist compared to boys. Amongst younger students yet to pick their GCSE options, there are significantly more girls than boys wanting to work in digital art. Multivariable regression analysis identified 10 factors that were associated with aspirations to become a computer scientist. These include being a boy, being of Asian ethnicity, currently studying GCSE Computer Science, having a parent in computing, as well as having higher ‘coding self-belief’, elevated levels of ‘family support’ and aspiring towards ‘technical jobs’. Implications for practice and curriculum design are discussed#FRE#
