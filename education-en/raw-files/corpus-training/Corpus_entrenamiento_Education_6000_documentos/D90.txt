#ITI#Challenges, adaptation, and learning in an immersive mindfulness-based practices course: college student perspectives#FTI#
#IRE# With the significant rise in mental health challenges among college students, opportunities exist for educators to adapt curricula that incorporate a focus on student wellness. This study brings qualitative and descriptive insights to the growing body of quantitative research on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based practices (MBPs) for improving student wellbeing. The data convey the perspectives of college students (n = 37) on the benefits and challenges of learning a range of mindfulness-based practices (meditation, yoga, qigong, and taijiquan) during a 16-week, general elective course for undergraduate students. The study also provides additional insight into how students adapted to these challenges, and what they find personally and professionally relevant about MBPs. Additionally, we present an overview of the curriculum used in this 16-week course on mind–body health and MBPs, including a schedule of the practices taught, such as meditation, yoga, taijiquan, and qigong. The findings reveal how students evaluated the experience of learning MBPs. Results are discussed in light of recommended course improvements, the need for future research, and the limitations of the study. These results may also be of use to faculty at other settings for designing new courses or revising existing courses that focus on student wellness and learning MBPs#FRE#
