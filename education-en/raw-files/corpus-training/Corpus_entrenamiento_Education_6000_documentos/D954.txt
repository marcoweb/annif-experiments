#ITI#A Mixed Reality-Based Chemistry Experiment Learning System to Facilitate Chemical Laboratory Safety Education#FTI#
#IRE# It is difficult for students to learn the concepts of chemical laboratory safety education from actual experiences because the traditional teaching model prohibits students from performing dangerous operations. Therefore, this study develops a novel mixed reality-based chemistry experiment learning system (MRCELS) to allow learners to conduct inquiry-based experimental operations in an environment integrating virtual and physical space by using a free and safe way so that chemical laboratory safety problems that usually occur in actual chemical laboratories that may hurt learners can be avoided. A total of 36 Grade 11 students from a girl’s high school in Taipei City, Taiwan, were recruited to participate in the experiment. A total of 17 students were randomly assigned to the experimental group using the MRCELS to conduct chemical laboratory safety education, while the remaining 19 students were randomly assigned to the control group taught by a teacher in a physical-chemical laboratory. The research results show that the learning effectiveness of experimental group learners in chemical laboratory safety education is significantly superior to that of the control group. Besides, experimental and control groups significantly improved their attitudes toward laboratory safety after the instruction experiment, but no significant differences existed between them. Both groups of learners showed high satisfaction with the learning model they used, but no significant differences existed between them. Encouragingly, according to the interview results, learners preferred to adopt the MRCELS to support learning. They stated that the immersion experience in operating the chemical experiments through the MRCELS could enhance their awareness of hazardous operations and the development of laboratory safety concepts. The developed MRCELS contributes an effective and innovative learning model to chemical laboratory safety education.#FRE#
