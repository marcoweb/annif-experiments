#ITI#Self-advocates with Down syndrome research the lived experiences of COVID-19 lockdowns in Aotearoa New Zealand#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Individuals with Down syndrome are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 because they are recognised as significantly immunocompromised. Yet their voices regarding their lived experiences of pandemic lockdowns have not been sought or heard. Aim: This study aims to describe the lived experiences of people with Down syndrome during the pandemic lockdowns in Aotearoa New Zealand to add evidence in order to inform systemic advocacy. Method: A mixed-methods approach positioned within an inclusive research paradigm was used, in which a group of self-advocates with Down syndrome co-designed a structured interview schedule and conducted 40 face-to-face interviews. Key themes were identified by using content analysis. Results: Despite the difficulties associated with lockdowns and participants not receiving their usual supports and having to make significant adjustments, they remained positive, adapted well, and demonstrated a high level of resilience and adaptability. Conclusions: The findings add to the limited research on the lived experiences of people with Down syndrome during pandemic lockdowns. This research has given them a voice to contribute to policy, government initiatives, and service providers; particularly on issues around support during lockdown and staying connected with others#FRE#
