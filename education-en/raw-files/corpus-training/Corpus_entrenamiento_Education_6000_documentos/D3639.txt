#ITI#Examining cognitive accessibility of the VIA Inventory of Strengths for adults with intellectual disability#FTI#
#IRE#Background: We evaluated cognitive accessibility of the VIA Inventory of Strengths Youth short form with adults with intellectual disability for use in strengths-based practice. Methods: We conducted cognitive testing with adults with intellectual disability (n = 33; M age = 36.2; range: 20.4–64.2). Data were coded for the extent to which (1) items were interpreted correctly; (2) participants endorsed items as describing themselves. We calculated descriptive statistics to evaluate item interpretation and response scale use. Results: On average, 59% of participants interpreted items correctly, 20% misinterpreted items, 14% had mixed interpretations. Positive item endorsement was most associated with the response ‘Very much like me’ (77%); mixed endorsement was most associated with ‘Somewhat like me’ (39%); and negative endorsement of items was most associated with ‘Not at all like me’ (54%). Conclusions: Revisions are necessary for several items to improve accessibility for adults with intellectual disability and should be made in collaboration with this population#FRE#
