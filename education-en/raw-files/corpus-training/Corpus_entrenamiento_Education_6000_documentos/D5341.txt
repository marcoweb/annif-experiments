#ITI#Targeting Internalizing Symptoms in Children: What is the Impact on School Functioning?#FTI#
#IRE#Internalizing problems may be associated with poor academic performance and school absenteeism among youth. This study investigated the impact of the EMOTION: “Coping Kids” Managing Anxiety and Depression Program on academic achievement and school adaptation in children. Data were collected in a national cluster-randomized controlled trial at three time points in Norway. Children (N = 688, 8–12 years), who had elevated levels of anxiety or depressive symptoms from 36 schools participated. There were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups post-intervention or at 12-month follow-up regarding academic achievement and school adaptation. Likewise, no significant intervention effects were identified for school-related variables in the anxiety-only, depression-only, or combined (anxiety and depression) groups. The intervention did not have an impact on school functioning. Thus, focusing on school-related challenges and enhanced collaboration with teachers, possibly through a tailored version of the EMOTION program, could be an interesting adaptation of the intervention#FRE#
