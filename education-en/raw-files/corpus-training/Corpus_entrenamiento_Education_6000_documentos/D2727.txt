#ITI#The pedagogical makerspace: Learning opportunity and challenge for prospective teachers' growth of TPACK#FTI#
#IRE# The aim of this study was (1) to describe challenges prospective teachers perceive during project work in a pedagogical makerspace and coping strategies they develop to deal with the challenges, (2) to analyse the development of prospective teachers' TPACK and attitudes towards the use of ICT in class. Challenges regarding project work and coping strategies were recorded via semi-structured interviews and evaluated by qualitative content analysis. TPACK and prospective teachers' attitudes towards the usefulness of digital technologies, technology acceptance, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, intentions to use digital media and constructivist understanding of teaching were assessed via questionnaire. The sample consists of German prospective teachers (N = 145). The results show an increase in TPACK, technology acceptance, intention to use digital media and motivation over the course of the project. TPACK before the intervention was the only variable that predicted TPACK after the intervention. The prospective teachers report numerous challenges during their projects, which can be attributed to the framework, teamwork, and taskwork levels, as well as the individual TPACK. Coping strategies were mainly found on the taskwork level, for example by adjusting goals, creating subtasks and organising regular feedback meetings for self-monitoring. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The opportunities for using ICT in schools are developing rapidly, and with them, the demands on teachers' skills (TPACK). The promotion of TPACK competencies in a holistic, multi-layered, and practice-oriented manner has to be learned over a longer period of time combining theoretical explanations with practical activities. Making appears to be a suitable activity to foster TPACK, and a makerspace was described as an ideal learning environment to follow constructivist learning, but it has not yet been empirically tested. What this paper adds The presentation of an innovative approach for prospective teachers to teach TPACK problem- and project-based in a pedagogical makerspace. Empirical data of a large sample size in a field that has not yet been sufficiently empirically researched. A model-based analysis of the challenges of project work in a university pedagogical makerspace regarding preservice teachers and their coping strategies. Examination of the suitability of project-based work in the pedagogical makerspace for teaching TPACK and relevant attitudes. Further insights about learning processes and influencing factors in a university pedagogical makerspace with respect to promoting TPACK. Implications for practice A pedagogical makerspace is a suitable learning environment to foster TPACK and attitudes towards the use of ICT in school. TPACK development depends on TPACK before working in a makerspace. Challenges and coping strategies while working in a pedagogical makerspace can be assigned to four levels. The assignment of challenges and coping strategies to those levels supports lecturers in developing the necessary support structures. Support structures should include at least basic knowledge about the organisation of projects. Agile project elements prove helpful for product development in the makerspace#FRE#
