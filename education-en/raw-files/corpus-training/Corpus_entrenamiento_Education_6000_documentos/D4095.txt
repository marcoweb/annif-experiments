#ITI#World regional geography and distant suffering: student and faculty perceptions of moral obligation#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of the research was to examine perceived moral agency beliefs, attitudes, and prosocial actions of 226 undergraduate World Regional Geography students and eight instructors at two Midwestern U.S. universities. The context of the research is positioned within the study of world regional geography courses in order to better understand students’ and professors’ perspectives and expectations for prosocial action while learning and teaching about global environmental and human issues. Theoretical backgrounds include living in a globalizing world, witnessing distant suffering, and moral education. Using a socio-psychological lens for examining geography learning related to motivations for prosocial behavior and moral agency, the research context included a framework for investigating student and instructor perspectives of prosocial behavior in response to human suffering and environmental crises. The cross-case study included mixed methodology, with analysis of student survey responses, student and professor interviews, and written reader-responses to global issues. Findings showed a significant correlation between when students felt disturbed by global crises and subsequent thoughts on moral agency. Results reveal diverging and contrasting views between students and professors, with undergraduate participant perspectives, requests, and significant suggestions for explicitly addressing pro-social actions in world regional geography for educators and students for the future#FRE#
