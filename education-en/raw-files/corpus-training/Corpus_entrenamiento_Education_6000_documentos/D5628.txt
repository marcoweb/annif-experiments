#ITI#Support for teachers in the inclusive education of pupils with special educational needs: experience from primary schools in the Czech Republic#FTI#
#IRE#The paper presents possibilities of effective use of some support instruments for teachers of mainstream schools in the education of pupils with special educational needs in the Czech primary schools. The research data collected during the project implemented in the Pilsen region in period of 2016–2019 were processed with the goal to evaluate the various kinds of support that are not yet systemically anchored in the Czech educational system and commonly available for teachers in primary schools, although these instruments seem to be very effective or even necessary for quality inclusive education. During the project, the educational activities like special workshops, seminars, or lifelong learning courses were offered to teachers, as well as on-site counselling services, supervision, methodological consultations or sharing the good practice of teachers and schools. A new position of inclusion coordinators as a kind of support for inclusive education was pilot-tested in partner schools within the project. However, the exploitation of the results of this research and assessment will depend largely on political decisions at both local and governmental levels#FRE#
