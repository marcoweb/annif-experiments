#ITI#Child-Sustained Attention in Two-Year-Olds#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study was to identify differences in the length of attention in 2-year olds across three teaching conditions. A total of 49 2-year-olds were observed within their childcare classrooms. The child’s regular classroom teacher was asked to select three highly preferred toys to use in offering the child choices within the teaching conditions of adult presentation (one toy) and adult choice (two toys); the child was given the instruction to “go play” during the child choice condition and could select from any material in the classroom. Children’s attention in the adult choice condition was significantly longer. Results from the present study highlight the importance of a highly skilled teacher who has knowledge of child development and an understanding of individual child preferences#FRE#
