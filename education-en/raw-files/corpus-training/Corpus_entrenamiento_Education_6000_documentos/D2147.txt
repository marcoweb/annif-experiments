#ITI#Student, direct thyself! Facilitating self-directed learning skills and motivation with an electronic development portfolio#FTI#
#IRE# This quasi-experimental study investigates the effects of using an electronic development portfolio (PERFLECT) with teacher-guided student self-coaching on the development of students' self-directed learning skills and motivation. In a 12-week program in senior vocational education, students in the PERFLECT group used the portfolio to help self-direct their learning, while the REGULAR group followed the regular educational program. Students in the PERFLECT group reported higher levels of self-direction, intrinsic goal orientation, and self-efficacy than students in the REGULAR group. Using an electronic development portfolio with a student self-coaching protocol constitutes a promising approach to support students' self-directed learning skills and motivation#FRE#
