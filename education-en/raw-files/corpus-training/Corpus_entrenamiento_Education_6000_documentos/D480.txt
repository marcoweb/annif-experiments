#ITI#Connecting counterspaces and community cultural wealth in a professional development program#FTI#
#IRE# This qualitative study analyzes the relationship between two concepts from critical race theory–counterspaces and community cultural wealth. Counterspaces are supportive, identity-affirming community spaces, while community cultural wealth highlights the importance of the knowledge, skills, and networks used by individuals belonging to marginalized groups to successfully navigate academia. This study investigates the hypothesis that the processes operating within counterspaces serve to strengthen an individual’s access to their community cultural wealth. The study site is BRAINS, a U.S.-based professional development program for early-career academic neuroscientists from underrepresented groups. Findings revealed that two types of counterspace processes (narrative identity work and direct relational transactions) and three types of community cultural wealth (aspirational capital, social capital, and navigational capital) are most salient within BRAINS. After examining the complex interactions connecting counterspace processes and community cultural wealth, we offer recommendations for future professional development programs and research designed to broaden participation in academia#FRE#
