#ITI#Making for science: a framework for the design of physical materials for science learning#FTI#
#IRE# Recent work in science education has emphasized the importance of the conceptual, social, and epistemic dimensions in science learning. But what about the material dimension—the actual physical materials that students use? The way their characteristics and affordances limit or determine instruction has thus far not been as thoroughly explored. Despite the vast body of work that exists on science and engineering practices, there are relatively few examples of how physical science materials are linked to and can support engagement with such practices for sensemaking. In this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing the design of these physical materials and the activities associated with them that can serve as lenses for educators and researchers to consider when planning and reflecting on classroom instruction. To validate our framework, we apply it to analyze activities developed and implemented by teachers during a four-year research-practice partnership project conducted in a city in Brazil, and investigate potential connections between the design of physical materials and students’ epistemic agency. We conclude with recommendations for the development of physical resources in labs and makerspaces for science learning. © Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2024.#FRE#
