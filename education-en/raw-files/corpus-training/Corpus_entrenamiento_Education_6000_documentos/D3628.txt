#ITI#The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on jobs for people with intellectual disabilities and autism in Wales#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The study reports the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdowns on jobs for people with intellectual disabilities and autism. The study focuses on the impact of the first and the fire-break lockdowns and the actions taken to support young people. Method: Data was collected from the cohort of young people currently working in Wales, and that received job coach support from the Engage to Change Project, on furlough arrangements, job retainment and job losses. Innovative initiatives to support young people are described. Results: Review of the working situation during the pandemic was conducted for 184 jobs, evaluating the proportion of young people being furloughed or working remotely and compared with the general population in Wales. Conclusions: Supported employment agencies adapted their practice during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering new and innovative ways to support young people and facilitate their return to work#FRE#
