#ITI#Experiences of work-integrated learning in nursing education#FTI#
#IRE#Nursing education and the nursing profession have an artisanal character, which has dominated the profession for a long time. Work-integrated learning in nursing education means that theoretical studies are integrated with a clinical placement. The aim of the study was to describe how nursing students experience work-integrated learning in nursing education. The study has a qualitative descriptive design. Qualitaitive content analysis was used and the analysis focused on both the manifest and latent content of the material. The analysis resulted in the theme Sustainable learning during education and for the future profession as a nurse, revealing students’ experiences of work-integrated learning during their education. The categories Different methods, Collaboration and Bringing the parts together as a whole constitute the integrated learning process during the education and depend on each other for increased understanding. When the students practice their theoretical knowledge in the clinical placement, work-integrated learning can facilitate them to bring the parts together as a whole, thus giving them an opportunity to enhance their learning process and develop professional skills#FRE#
