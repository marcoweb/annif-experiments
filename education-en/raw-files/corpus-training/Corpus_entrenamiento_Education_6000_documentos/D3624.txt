#ITI#Clinicians' experiences of learning to use eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy with people with intellectual disabilities: A qualitative study#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing therapy (EMDR) is a NICE recommended treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder within the general population. Ongoing research is now investigating the use of EMDR for individuals with intellectual disability. Alongside quantitative research efforts, it is beneficial to explore the qualitative experience of clinicians adopting EMDR in their practice. The current study interviewed newly trained EMDR therapists working in intellectual disability services. Method: Participants (six Clinical Psychologists from an NHS learning disability service) had recently undertaken EMDR training as part of a wider randomised control trial (Trauma-AID). Interviews were qualitatively analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Three themes emerged; learning EMDR, conducting EMDR and external factors, with respect to clinicians' experiences. Conclusions: Further research is needed to provide guidance and reassurance for clinicians currently using or hoping to use this therapy with people with intellectual disabilities#FRE#
