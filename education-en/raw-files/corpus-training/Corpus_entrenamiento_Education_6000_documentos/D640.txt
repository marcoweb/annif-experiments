#ITI#Embedding Indigenous cultural competencies within a digital media and communication context in Australian higher education#FTI#
#IRE# In 2011, Universities Australia published a best practice framework to support the Australian higher education sector to build Indigenous cultural competency institutionally, support Indigenous students and staf,f and to develop the Indigenous cultural competencies of students through curriculum and learning outcomes. For many institutions, this has resulted in the development of Indigenous graduate attributes aimed at building the Indigenous cultural competencies of all students, including non-Indigenous students, with specific Indigenous cultural competencies embedded as learning outcomes within discipline programmes. To date, there has been limited discussion of the embedding of Indigenous cultural competencies within practice-based Australian media and communication programmes such as journalism, film and video production or digital media. This article presents a case study on the embedding of an Indigenous Graduate Attribute within a digital media programme in 2018 and 2019, with an objective of building Indigenous cultural competencies in relation to students’ digital media practice. This case study discusses the development of a set of integrated teaching and learning activities and an assessment foregrounding Indigenous content and principles and protocols designed to equip students with cultural competencies that can be applied to their future professional media practice. While the case study is specific, it has relevance to the ongoing discussion of embedding Indigenous competencies into media and communication programmes more broadly#FRE#
