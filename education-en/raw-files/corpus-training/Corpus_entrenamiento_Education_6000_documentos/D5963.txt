#ITI#Hero, survivor or stuck: a narrative analysis of student constructions of persistence after failure#FTI#
#IRE#Academic failure is commonplace in higher education. Some students persist and go on to complete their courses. However, some do not, and this can create problems for themselves and the institutions in which they are enrolled. If we could understand students’ lived experiences of academic failure and persistence, it may be possible to design strategies that assist others to more effectively navigate the demands of higher education. A narrative inquiry was undertaken with students who failed and persisted with their course to understand how identities and agency influenced persistence following failure. Using figured worlds theory and narrative analysis, three patterns of persistence were identified characterised as a hero’s journey, surviving failure and stuck in the system. The positions students adopted in relation to other actors within their narratives ranged from active to passive, highlighting different agentic responses of students. Implications for supporting students to recover from failure are discussed#FRE#
