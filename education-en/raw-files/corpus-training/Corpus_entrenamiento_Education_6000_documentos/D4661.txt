#ITI#Repositioning students as co-creators of curriculum for online learning resources#FTI#
#IRE#Amid increasing calls for universities to transition to online learning, there is a need to explore how platforms and technology can provide positive student experiences and support learning. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of an online peer learning and recommender platform in a large, multi-campus, first-year health subject (n = 2095). The Recommendation in Personalised Peer Learning Environments (RiPPLE) platform supports student’s co-creation of learning resources and allows for students to provide feedback and rate their peers’ submissions. Our results indicated that both student engagement and academic performance were positively impacted for users by the introduction of the RiPPLE platform, but that academic preparedness, in the form of students’ ATAR scores, strongly influenced their engagement and the benefits received.Implications for practice or policy:• We explored if students were willing to co-create learning resources online.• Our study piloted an online platform known as Recommendation in Personalised Peer Learning Environments (RiPPLE).• Critical analysis provides insights into fostering online engagement and peer learning.• We further offer recommendations for future practice on how to embed online student co-creation of curriculum © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
