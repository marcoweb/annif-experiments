#ITI#Understanding how educational maths apps can enhance learning: A content analysis and qualitative comparative analysis#FTI#
#IRE# Educational applications (apps) are ubiquitous within children's learning environments and emerging evidence has demonstrated their efficacy. However, it remains unclear what the active ingredients (ie, mechanisms), or combination of ingredients, of successful maths apps are. The current study developed a new, open-access, three-step framework for assessing the educational value of maths apps, comprised of type of app, mathematical content and app design features. When applied to a selection of available maths apps previously evaluated with children in the first 3 years of school (the final sample included 23 apps), results showed that practice-based apps were the most common app type tested (n = 15). Basic number skills, such as number representation and relationships, were the most common area of mathematics targeted by apps (n = 21). A follow-up qualitative comparative analysis showed observed learning outcomes with maths apps were enhanced when apps combined the following: a scaffolded and personalised learning journey (programmatic levelling) and explanations of why answers were right or wrong (explanatory feedback), as well as praise, such as ‘Great job!’ (motivational feedback). This novel evidence stresses the significance of feedback and levelling design features that teaching practitioners and other stakeholders should consider when deciding which apps to use with young children. Directions for future research are discussed. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Educational apps have been shown to support maths attainment in the first 3 years of school. Several existing frameworks have attempted to assess the educational value of some of these maths apps. Emerging experimental evidence also demonstrates the benefits of specific app design features, including feedback and levelling. What this paper adds Practice-based maths apps are the most common type of app previously evaluated with young children. These evaluated maths apps have mostly focused on basic number skills. The combination of explanatory and motivational feedback, with programmatic levelling (either dynamic or static), was a necessary condition for enhancing learning outcomes with maths apps. Implications for practice and policy The inclusion of feedback and levelling in maths apps should be considered by app developers when designing apps, and by educational practitioners and parents when deciding which apps to use with their children. Further consideration is also needed for the development of educational apps that include a broad range of maths skills#FRE#
