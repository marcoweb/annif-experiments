#ITI#Funds of knowledge in making: reenvisioning maker education in teacher preparation#FTI#
#IRE# Despite the growth of the Maker Movement, few studies have examined what learning opportunities in teacher education programs facilitate preservice teachers’ understanding of inclusive making for students from diverse backgrounds. This study explored how preservice teachers used their funds of knowledge for making projects in a STEM education course and how the use of these funds of knowledge influenced their perspectives on maker education. Guided by ethnographic research principles, we analyzed qualitative data collected from 15 preservice teachers. The findings show that preservice teachers used their diverse funds of knowledge in ways that: (a) transformed making practices into personally relevant learning activities, (b) positioned themselves as experts, (c) facilitated mutual learning, and (d) provided a significant resource for creative ideas in advancing making projects#FRE#
