#ITI#Investigating student reasoning about measurement uncertainty and ability to draw conclusions from measurement data in inquiry-based university physics labs#FTI#
#IRE#Measurement uncertainty is a key topic in the university physics laboratory curriculum. In this study, we investigate students’ ability to draw conclusions from measurement data and reasoning about measurement uncertainty in inquiry labs. This investigation centres around a task where students conclude whether measurements from two experiments that differ only by one setup agree or disagree. Surveys were administered in introductory physics courses before and after Workshop Physics instruction, which utilises an activity-based, guided-inquiry approach. Student reasoning was characterised using the point and set paradigms. Think-aloud interviews were conducted to gain deeper insights into students' interpretations of measurement uncertainty. The survey results showed that students tended to draw conclusions based on the means without appropriately accounting for uncertainty even if many recognised the need to evaluate uncertainty. The number of decimal places had no influence on students’ ability to draw conclusions. After instruction, students’ reasoning shifted from point toward set or mixed paradigm, but their ability to draw conclusions did not improve. During the interviews, students demonstrated sophisticated interpretations about measurement uncertainty and data analysis strategies they used. Students recognised measurement uncertainty is inevitable and were able to identify possible sources of uncertainty. We discuss implications for instruction around measurement uncertainty#FRE#
