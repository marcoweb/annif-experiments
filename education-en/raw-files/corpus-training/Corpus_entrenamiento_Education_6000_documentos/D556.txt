#ITI#Hidden Success: Learning From the Counternarratives of High School Graduates Impacted by Student Homelessness#FTI#
#IRE# The number of youth experiencing homelessness in the United States has nearly doubled over the past decade from 688,000 in 2006 to over 1.3 million as of 2017. While graduating high school is a significant barrier for many students experiencing homelessness, many youth are able to successfully graduate despite their unstable living conditions. This qualitative study used the antideficit achievement framework to analyze the counternarratives of eight youth who successfully graduated high school while experiencing homelessness. Findings showed that strong peer relationships, the support from caring teachers, and attending church served as impactful influences that helped youth experiencing homelessness graduate high school.#FRE#
