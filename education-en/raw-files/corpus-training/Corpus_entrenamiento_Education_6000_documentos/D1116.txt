#ITI#When negative feedback harms: a systematic review of the unintended consequences of negative feedback on psychological, attitudinal, and behavioral responses#FTI#
#IRE# A plethora of research emphasizes the importance of performance feedback as an adaptive way to improve the outcomes of undergraduate students. However, research on negative performance feedback (i.e. communicating the results of a critical assessment related to student performance) and the potential unintended negative consequences remains fragmented and non-comprehensive. The current systematic review provides an integrative synthesis of the literature that details the unintended negative consequences of negative performance feedback on undergraduate students. It also identifies the contexts in which these consequences are more likely to occur. Using the 36 articles that fit the study’s search criteria, we found negative effects on self-efficacy, cognition, affect, and behavior. These factors were moderated by the characteristics of the feedback provider and the feedback receiver, the feedback style, and demographic variables. Based on our review, we propose a new integrative model. This study contributes to the literature and practice of teaching and learning by providing educators with an up-to-date review of negative feedback. It also provides a multidisciplinary examination and identifies future research directions#FRE#
