#ITI#Learning to Fly: Development and Design of a Micro-Credentialing System for an Educator Preparation Program in the Absence of a Required Educational Technology Course#FTI#
#IRE#Technology integration within instructional practices is an essential element in the preparation of teachers. However, expectations that a single course or hopes that technology infusion will spontaneously occur are not enough to prepare teacher candidates to integrate technology in meaningful ways. In the absence of a required educational technology course for all initial licensure candidates, an educator preparation program in the Midwest sought creative solutions to meet accreditation and clinical placement expectations regarding candidate preparation to integrate technology. This report from the field discusses the iterative process to develop a comprehensive micro-credentialing system aligned with the ISTE standards for educators. The micro-credentials provide candidates opportunities to apply and model technology use within courses and throughout their program. Feedback from stakeholders indicated both possibilities and potential challenges in the adoption of the system. This feedback has led to further development of the micro-credentialing system#FRE#
