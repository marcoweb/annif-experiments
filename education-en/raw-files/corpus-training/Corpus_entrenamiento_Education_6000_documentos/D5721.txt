#ITI#School transfers in special education: frequency, direction, and timing of transfers between different school settings#FTI#
#IRE#Many countries provide multiple school settings for students with special educational needs (SEN), such as inclusive schooling in mainstream school, special classes, and special schools. However, even though school transfers are especially challenging for students with SEN, research on transfers between different school settings (i.e. placements) for students with SEN is scarce. The current study used administrative census data about students in Switzerland to investigate the frequency, direction, and timing of transfers between school settings attended by students with SEN. Results showed a relatively high percentage of transfers between school settings relative to the estimated number of students with SEN. The direction and timing of transfers varied by setting type. For special classes serving students with moderate SEN and special schools, transfers into these settings greatly outnumbered transfers out of the settings. Transfer peaks were observed at normative transition points (e.g. from kindergarten to primary school)#FRE#
