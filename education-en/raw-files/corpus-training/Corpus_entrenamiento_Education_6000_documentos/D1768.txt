#ITI#Anxiety only makes it worse: Exploring the impact mechanisms of app-based learning on performance progress#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Mobile devices facilitate learning activities in a self-paced way. However, the current understanding of learning participation and its consequence are minimal when learners take advantage of opportunities provided by mobile technologies worldwide. Aims: The primary purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of environmental incentives on app learning behaviour and learning performance based on a multi-dimensional approach. We also evaluate whether the role of anxiety attenuates these influences. Method and objective: In this study, 323 participants’ learning activities were tracked weekly to measure the completion of their daily learning plan during 16 weeks. Then, an online survey was conducted to assess the environmental incentives, perceptions, and self-evaluations of these participants after the learning tracking process. Participants’ learning progress was measured by the comparison of paired course test scores before and after the tracking period. Results and Conclusions: The results indicated that engagement, sense of meaning, and stage accomplishment exerted a directly significant influence on shaping the learning habits and outcomes. In addition, the results also tapped the role of anxiety in the app learning context, indicating the significant moderating effects on the relationship between social incentives, stage accomplishment, and learning habits. The app learning habits of the users with high-level anxiety exerted less impact on their performance progress than users with low-level anxiety. This study provides insights into how the mobile environment can influence learning activities and learning performance, implying practical implications to leverage mobile technologies for educational purposes#FRE#
