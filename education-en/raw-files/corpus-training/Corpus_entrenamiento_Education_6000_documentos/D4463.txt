#ITI#On silent feet: the library and the child#FTI#
#IRE#In 1966 the photographer Martine Franck was commissioned by Life International to document the experiences of children in a new library in Paris. The visual essay she produced illuminated the materiality, the design and the children’s use of the space. In Birmingham, a recent unconnected research project, ‘Libraries in Women’s Lives’, captured women’s childhood memories of libraries. The women’s ‘spatial stories’ (de Certeau, 1984) offer reflections on libraries in different times and places. Strikingly though, their accounts resonate with Franck’s images of the library in Paris. This paper brings image and narrative into conversation with spatial theory to make sense of these similarities, and to explore responses to library space. This paper is a comment on the materiality of the library. It reveals the haptic and visual pleasures of these sites. Through this attention to memory, the research suggests a different starting point for debates around the future of libraries. It argues that looking to the past might be a good way of thinking about the libraries of the future. Further, and by virtue of attending to the visual alongside writing on spatial theory, this research comments on the relationship between representations of space in image and in text#FRE#
