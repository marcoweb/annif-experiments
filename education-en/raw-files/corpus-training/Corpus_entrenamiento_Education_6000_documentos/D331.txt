#ITI#How do competitiveness and previous contact with people with disabilities impact on attitudes after an awareness intervention in physical education?#FTI#
#IRE# In addition to inclusion as an educational philosophy, integrated schooling has emerged worldwide as an influential trend in education over the last few decades; this has increased the number of students with disabilities in classrooms, including in physical education (PE). This state of affairs requires that teachers provide support and resources to ensure that all students, regardless of ability, can reach their full potential through opportunities for equal participation. The previous contact with people with disabilities and the level of the students’ competitiveness are two factors where there is a lack of clarity as to their effects on attitudes towards the inclusion of a partner with a disability. Therefore, it is necessary to deepen the understanding of how these variables influence students’ attitudes after the implementation of an intervention to raise awareness of the inclusion of students with disabilities in PE. This study aimed: (1) to analyse the effects of the educational programme ‘Inclusive Sport in School’ on the attitudes of students without disabilities towards the inclusion of peers with a disability, (2) to analyse the influence of the previous contact with people with disabilities on the attitudes of students towards inclusion in PE after the intervention, and (3) to explore the level of competitiveness on attitude outcomes. A sample of 1068 students (534 girls and 534 boys) without disability (13.9 ± 1.76 yr.) was divided according to the type of established contact at their school setting: regular school settings (no contact), inclusive settings with non-structured contact and inclusive settings with structured contact (where students with disabilities were included in the PE classes). Attitudes towards inclusion were measured through Spanish version of the Children’s Attitudes Toward Integrated Physical Education Revised inventory CAIPE-RS. A mixed-factor analysis of variance was implemented, with an intra-group factor (i.e. pre vs post-intervention) and two between-group factors: the three types of contact and the reported level of competitiveness (low, moderate, or high). Results showed a significant impact on the general subscale of attitude after the intervention. The interaction effects between the between-group and the intra-group factors were not significant. However, the t-test of related measurements showed significant differences on the general attitude subscale for the students of the inclusive centres where there were [t(351) = −6.11; p < 0.01)] or there were not [t(199) = −2.43; p = 0.016)] students with disabilities in the PE class, showing more positive values of attitude after the intervention. Additionally, those perceived to have a moderate or high level of competitiveness also exhibited an increase in their degree of general attitude after the intervention while the students from inclusive schools with a low competitive level showed a significant decrease in attitude on the specific attitude subscale. It is concluded that the effect of the intervention could be influenced by the type of contact and that the level of competitiveness is a constraining variable for awareness interventions in PE. To develop interventions which have a significant impact on attitude towards inclusion in PE, awareness programmes should be designed which consider direct contact with people with disabilities to generate the target attitude#FRE#
