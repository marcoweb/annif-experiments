#ITI#Are Non-Native English Speaking Students Disadvantaged in College Experiences and Cognitive Outcomes?#FTI#
#IRE#Using data from the Wabash National Study of Liberal Arts Education (WNS), this study examined the college experiences and cognitive outcomes of non-native English speaking (NNES) students. After an extensive control of precollege and college level influences, results indicate that NNES students had a lower level of participation in collaborative learning and cocurricular activities and obtained smaller gains during college in objectively assessed critical thinking skills and positive orientation toward literacy activities than their peers. Although findings demonstrate that NNES students encountered challenges in engaging in certain college experiences and gaining desired cognitive outcomes, such results should be viewed in a cultural and language context, meaning that measures widely accepted in the American higher education institutions may or may not accurately reflect the experiences and development of NNES students in their own cultural standards. Findings of this study highlight the importance of language background and call for attention regarding facilitating NNES students’ college engagement and cognitive development#FRE#
