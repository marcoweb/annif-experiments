#ITI#PK-5 teacher perspectives on the design of remote teaching: pedagogies and support structures to sustain student learning online#FTI#
#IRE# The shift to emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted a need to develop technologies, resources, and strategies for teaching elementary grade learners online. This study uses online teacher inquiry as a form of practice-based knowledge production to identify and develop instructional practices and support structures for online teaching in grades PK-5. Six teachers of PK-5 classrooms in the United States participated in a teacher inquiry program as they transitioned from in-person to online teaching. Findings provide guidance to assist teachers and administrators in designing teaching and structures that support online learning in the elementary grades#FRE#
