#ITI#Why students participate in international fieldwork programs: an exploratory study#FTI#
#IRE#International fieldwork programs that provide learning opportunities abroad have become increasingly popular in undergraduate education worldwide. Gaining insight into students’ motives to engage in these programs can assist in formulating strategies for program development; however, few studies have investigated this topic. This study addresses the existing research gap by comparing Japanese university students who participated in international fieldwork programs and those who did not by applying the theory of planned behavior. Our findings suggest that constructs, such as perceived behavioral control and positive attitudes toward participation may positively affect the student’s intention to participate in international fieldwork. Further, the approval and support of individuals close to those students, notably their relatives, influenced their participation. This study also suggests the importance of including past behaviors as an additional reinforcing factor. Based on our findings, we make suggestions about how international fieldwork programs should be promoted#FRE#
