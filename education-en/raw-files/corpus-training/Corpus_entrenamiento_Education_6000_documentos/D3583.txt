#ITI#Mental health, challenging behaviour, diagnosis, and access to employment for people with intellectual disabilities in Norway#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Studies have found that presence of challenging behaviours and mental health problems limits employment for people with intellectual disabilities. This study investigates the associations between age, gender, living condition, level of intellectual disability, diagnoses, behaviour, mental health, and employment in adults with intellectual disabilities in Norway. Method: A cross-sectional community-based survey including 214 adult participants (56% men) with intellectual disabilities. Results: In our sample, 25% had no organised day activity, 27% attended non-work day care, 19% attended sheltered employment, or day care with production, without pay and 29% worked in paid sheltered employment. One participant attended mainstream employment. Moderate and severe/profound level of intellectual disability, possible organic condition and irritability significantly reduced the odds of employment (paid and unpaid). Conclusion: Findings suggest unequal access to the sheltered employment that was meant to be inclusive. More individualised evaluation of prerequisites is suggested to further facilitate employment for this group#FRE#
