#ITI#Changes in control and value appraisals predict changes in learning enjoyment: A four-wave analysis among lower secondary school students#FTI#
#IRE# Background: The control-value theory of achievement emotions postulates that it is possible to affect achievement emotions by decreasing or increasing control and value appraisals. This implies that changes in the latter should result in changes in the former. However, the assumption has been rarely tested. Aims: This study aimed at verifying whether changes in control and value appraisals – two proximal antecedents of achievement emotions – predicted changes in learning enjoyment over the course of lower secondary school. Moreover, since studying changes requires knowledge of their overall pattern, it also investigated the developmental trajectories of the three student characteristics. Sample: The study used longitudinal data of 5125 German students gathered between Grades 5 and 9, four measurement occasions in total. Methods: The hypotheses were tested using univariate and multivariate latent change score models. Results: The analyses revealed decreases in control and value appraisals and learning enjoyment between Grades 5 and 9. Moreover, the decreases in control and value appraisals predicted the decreases in learning enjoyment. Conclusions: The study provides support for the change–change assumption, which is one of the key but under-researched elements of the control-value theory of achievement emotions. As such, it suggests that alleviating the decrease in control and value appraisals may mitigate the decrease in learning enjoyment. Moreover, by providing longitudinal evidence on the decrease in the three constructs under study, it corroborates the inimical trend observed in past research#FRE#
