#ITI#What I think I learned#FTI#
#IRE# A retrospective review of 50 years of research and development experience showing the connectedness of the author’s theoretical ideas to practical application. An effort to show designers how over the span of a career new ideas begin as work-related insights and discoveries that by problem solving flow together to create a unique personal view of design and designing. Encouragement for individual designers to be willing to experiment with new ideas that may step beyond received practice and to learn from those experiences, even to the extent of testing and adopting new worldviews that may differ from the general view. Encouragement for revisiting foundational documents of the field of educational and instructional technology to examine the intent of the founders and to build possible alternative interpretations of their meaning. A recommendation of topics the field should consider to maintain relevance within a rapidly changing theoretical and technical landscape. © Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2024.#FRE#
