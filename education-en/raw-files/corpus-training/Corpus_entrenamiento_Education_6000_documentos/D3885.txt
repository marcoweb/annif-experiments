#ITI#It Matters: Early Childhood Mental Health, Educator Stress, and Burnout#FTI#
#IRE#Early childhood educators (ECEs) face several workplace challenges, including young children’s difficult behavior and mental health needs, workplace stress, low systemic support, and high levels of burnout. Both education and perceived confidence are often cited as important buffering factors, yet neither is well studied in the existing literature. The present study aimed to better understand and describe these factors. A survey, including both open and closed questions, was sent out to a large group of ECEs. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics, T-tests, and the constant comparison method of qualitative coding. Findings suggest that the types of training ECEs have had is related to their comfort in recognizing and responding to young children’s mental health and challenging behaviors. Both systemic changes and didactic needs were cited as necessary to further support ECEs#FRE#
