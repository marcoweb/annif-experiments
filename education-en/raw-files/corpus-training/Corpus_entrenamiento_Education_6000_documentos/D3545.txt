#ITI#The effect of a telehealth exercise intervention on balance in adults with Down syndrome#FTI#
#IRE#Background: People with Down syndrome often present with balance deficits, which compromise safety during daily activity. While evidence shows that exercise can improve balance in the Down syndrome population, it is unclear if a telehealth method will elicit similar benefits. We aimed to examine the effects of a virtual exercise program on balance in adults with Down syndrome. Methods: Eighteen low-active participants with Down syndrome completed a 12-week telehealth exercise program based on the Mann Method. Balance testing took place before and after the intervention, which included: TUG, MCTSIB, FICSIT-4, and FRT. This study was registered as a clinical trial on ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT04647851. Results: Significant improvement was seen in the TUG (p =.043), FICSIT-4 (p =.019) and FRT (p =.019). All participants achieved maximum scores on the MCTSIB in pre- and post-testing. Conclusions: Balance in low-active adults with Down syndrome significantly improved following the telehealth exercise program, which we attribute to the tailored exercises that address visual/vestibular deficits and hip muscle weakness#FRE#
