#ITI#Numeracy, Cognitive, and Motivational Predictors of Elementary Mathematics Achievement#FTI#
#IRE# Cognitive, numeracy, and motivational factors have been implicated in math achievement. However, few studies have investigated these factors simultaneously and in middle childhood, limiting our understanding of the relative contributions of these factors during an important developmental period. The current study investigated how one numeracy, four cognitive, and three motivational factors predicted math performance in 525 third, 771 fourth, and 465 fifth grade students, and whether these relations changed by grade and the type of math measured. Participants completed the California Standards Test (CST; Educational Testing Service, 2014) in Spring 2012 and Spring 2013 to assess math performance, and a battery of numeracy, cognitive, and motivational measures in Spring 2013. Separate multilevel regressions predicting 2013 CST performance were conducted for each grade, and z scores were used to compare the coefficients between grades. Results showed that updating and math expectancy were related to broad-level math performance for all grades. Further, numeracy and shifting were most predictive of math performance for younger grades, whereas math expectancy was most predictive for older grades across a range of math content. The results suggest that numeracy, cognitive, and motivational factors all relate to math performance when these three types of factors are considered, with numeracy, updating, shifting, and math expectancy showing the most reliable relations depending on grade. The relations between factors and math types may also have implications for interventions aiming to improve specific types of math#FRE#
