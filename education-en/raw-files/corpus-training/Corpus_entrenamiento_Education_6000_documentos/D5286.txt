#ITI#Identifying Competency Demands in Calculus Textbook Examples: the Case of Integrals#FTI#
#IRE#This study investigates how three widely used calculus textbooks realise integrals as a potential to prompt mathematical competencies, adapting the rating scheme used in Boesen et al. (The Journal of Mathematical Behavior, 33:72–87, 2014), Pettersen and Braeken (International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education, 17(2):405–425, 2019) and Turner, Blum and Niss (2015). For this purpose, the study analysed examples (n = 444) about integrals—specifically, to assess the extent to which solving those examples calls for the activation of a particular set of mathematical competencies: Communication; Devising Strategies; Mathematising; Representation; Using Symbols, Operations and Formal Language [Symbols and Formalism]; Reasoning and Argument. The competency demand of the examples was also identified on a scale from 0 (lowest demand) to 3 (highest demand) for each of six mathematical competencies. The findings revealed substantial similarities among the three calculus textbooks with regard to the level of competency demands: high level of Communication and Symbols and Formalism and low level of Devising Strategies, Representation, Reasoning and Argument and Mathematising. Relationships between these findings, implementations and future research directions are also discussed#FRE#
