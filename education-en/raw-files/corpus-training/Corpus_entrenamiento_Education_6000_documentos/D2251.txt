#ITI#On the Pitfalls of Estimating and Using Standardized Reliability Coefficients#FTI#
#IRE# The population discrepancy between unstandardized and standardized reliability of homogeneous multicomponent measuring instruments is examined. Within a latent variable modeling framework, it is shown that the standardized reliability coefficient for unidimensional scales can be markedly higher than the corresponding unstandardized reliability coefficient, or alternatively substantially lower than the latter. Based on these findings, it is recommended that scholars avoid estimating, reporting, interpreting, or using standardized scale reliability coefficients in empirical research, unless they have strong reasons to consider standardizing the original components of utilized scales.#FRE#
