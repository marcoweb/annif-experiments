#ITI#Science-Based Educational Escape Games: A Game Design Methodology#FTI#
#IRE#The growing trend of “escape games” in science education instigates debate over their pedagogical value, with researchers calling for more emphasis on theory-based design processes. Thus, the current study’s goal was to identify situated learning components that can be associated with educational escape games and to generate a methodology that integrates these components into the design of science-based educational escape games. Applying the deductive content analysis approach, data were collected through a survey and semi-structured interviews among 54 science teachers and seven game design experts. Four situated learning components, authentic situations, scientific contents, collaborative learning, and self-reflection, were associated with the design of educational escape games. In addition, planning and evaluation were identified as important attributes of game design methodology, with each stage including three iterative sequential inner stages associated with two or more situated learning components. The study contributes new insights to the domain of science-based educational escape games, providing guidelines and examples for science teachers and game developers. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
