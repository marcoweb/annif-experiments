#ITI#The effects of three different storytelling approaches on the vocabulary acquisition and response patterns of young EFL students#FTI#
#IRE# Storytelling is a well-established literary practice in language classrooms. However, approaches influencing its effectiveness and efficiency have rarely been investigated. This study compared the effects of three storytelling approaches on the vocabulary acquisition and response patterns of third-grade students of English as a foreign language (EFL). The storytelling approaches we considered are commonly used in schools, including storytelling alone (S), storytelling with word focus (S+W), and storytelling with activities (S+A). Our research comprised a three-week pilot study and a nine-week main study. For both studies, a pretest–posttest design involving a delayed test was used. Video recordings were also captured to facilitate the categorization of in-class response patterns. Results indicated that storytelling alone achieved the best performance. Vocabulary improvement with word focus or follow-up activities faded over the long term. The groups (S and S+W) which heard more stories generated more responses based on their own knowledge and life experience (as opposed to simply recalling facts) than did the group which completed more supplementary activities (S+A). This article provides both pedagogical implications and invitations for future empirical research.#FRE#
