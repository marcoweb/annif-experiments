#ITI#Strategies to Better Identify Student Homelessness Using Data in an Urban School District#FTI#
#IRE# We tested 10 data-based strategies to better identify student homelessness in Camden City School District, which has a student body from minoritized backgrounds. We operationalized strategies through a research-practice partnership, following the federal homelessness definition. Data span 5 years (2014–15 through 2018–19), including integrated education, municipal, and health records. Nine strategies indicated significant unidentified student homelessness (min: 15; max: 5,008; p-values <.001). Consistent with homelessness, six strategies produced groups with lower attendance (p-values <.01) and seven with increased school mobility (p-values <.05). Homelessness was 34% greater in the most conservative interpretation, though counts could be as much as 454% greater. Student homelessness is more prevalent than recognized, data-based strategies can guide proactive outreach, and cross-system partnerships are warranted#FRE#
