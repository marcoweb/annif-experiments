#ITI#An online field experience using mixed reality virtual simulation#FTI#
#IRE# A convergent parallel mixed methods study was employed to investigate teacher candidates’, peers’, and the instructor’s perceptions of teacher candidates’ teaching performance during an online field experience using virtual simulation in a mixed reality environment. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected simultaneously, analyzed separately, then merged to explore the differences and similarities between teacher candidates’, peers’, and instructor’s perceptions. The results revealed (1) teacher candidates were not accurately assessing their instructional practices or the instructional practices of their peers when compared to the instructor’s assessment, (2) instructor and peer coaching were very beneficial, (3) teacher candidates and the instructor believed online instruction was difficult, and (4) perspectives about the authenticity of the online virtual simulation were ambiguous#FRE#
