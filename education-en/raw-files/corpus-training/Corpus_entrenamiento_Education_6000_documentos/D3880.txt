#ITI#Early Childhood Administrator Perspectives About Preschool Inclusion: A Qualitative Interview Study#FTI#
#IRE#This qualitative phenomenological study utilized structured interviews with 23 preschool administrators to explore their beliefs about preschool inclusion and needed resources for providing high-quality preschool inclusion. Themes emerged regarding administrators’ beliefs about inclusion, including divergent understandings of inclusion as something that is either for all or for some children. Administrators placed a high value on families’ preferences regarding preschool inclusion and at times focused their descriptions of inclusion on logistical aspects of placements and funding. Administrators said they needed additional money and personnel resources to provide high-quality preschool inclusion. Study findings are discussed in the context of the paucity of research on administrator perspectives regarding inclusion and implications for supporting administrators who play a key role in implementing preschool inclusion. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
