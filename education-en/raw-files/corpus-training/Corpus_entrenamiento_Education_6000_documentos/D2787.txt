#ITI#Is the Literacy Achievement of Teenage Boys Poorer Than That of Teenage Girls, or Do Estimates of Gender Gaps Depend on the Test? A Comparison of PISA and PIAAC#FTI#
#IRE# Data from international large-scale assessments (ILSAs) of schooled populations indicate that boys haveconsiderably poorer literacy skills than girls. New evidence from a household-based ILSA—Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC)—indicatesthat the gender gap in literacy is negligible, even though its assessment framework is similar to that ofone of the most widely used school-based assessments, the Program for International StudentAssessment (PISA). Individual-level data from 15-, 16-, and 17-year-old teens in countries that administeredboth assessments were used to estimate and compare literacy gender gaps in the two assessments,after accounting for differences in target population, response rates, scoring scheme, test length, modeof delivery, prevalence of items involving different stimuli in the two assessments (e.g., types of texts),and cognitive processes test-takers need to engage in to solve assessment items (e.g., accessing andretrieving information or reflecting and evaluating information presented in the text). These differencesexplain only part of the differences across the two studies in estimated literacy gender gaps: Even whenthese factors are considered, gender gaps remain large in PISA and small (though imprecisely estimated)in PIAAC. The potential roles of test-taking motivation and administration conditions in explaining differencesacross the studies and implications for research and policy are discussed#FRE#
