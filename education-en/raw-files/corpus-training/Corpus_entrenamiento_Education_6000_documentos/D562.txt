#ITI#Classification of Dropouts to Improve Student Re-Engagement: The Case of Chilean Secondary Opportunity Centers#FTI#
#IRE# Chile offers high school dropouts a chance to graduate through enrollment in Second Opportunity Centers, located in cities ranging in population from 5 million inhabitants to less than 100,000. Participants in 18 centers were classified into four distinct classes based on their family situation, handicaps, employment, experience with discrimination, and ambitions. Students were compared with respect to their satisfaction with Center activities. Students experiencing instability in their lives, more often in larger cities, were least satisfied. The most successful activity was workshops discussing psychological and social issues. Some activities failed to attract any of the four classes of students.#FRE#
