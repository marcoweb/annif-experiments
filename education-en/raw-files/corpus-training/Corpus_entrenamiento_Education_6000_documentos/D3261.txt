#ITI#Exploring an Innovative Approach to Enhance Discussion Board Engagement#FTI#
#IRE#Online discussion boards are a standard learning management system (LMS) instructional tool used in the emerging online learning pedagogy. This pilot study examined an innovative approach that differs from how discussion boards have been commonly used. Using a retrospective, cross-sectional design, we evaluated the effect of shifting from traditional teacher and student-generated prompts to using student-generated videos with higher-order discussion questions to gauge student perceptions of peer feedback and engagement. Participants were graduate students in a health care administration course at a large university. Overall students’ perceptions of creating and responding to student-generated prompts were positive. Students responded that they were more engaged and thought more critically about the content with this shift from the traditional way of using discussion boards. As digital technology reshapes higher education, it is essential to reflect and evaluate the effectiveness of current LMS applications and standard procedures to improve educational delivery#FRE#
