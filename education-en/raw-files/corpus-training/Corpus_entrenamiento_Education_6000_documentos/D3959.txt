#ITI#The relations between students' belongingness, self-efficacy, and response to active learning in science, math, and engineering classes#FTI#
#IRE#Despite numerous benefits, students do not always respond positively and engage in active learning in STEM courses. Understanding the factors that influence how students’ respond to active learning is important to devising interventions that support their learning, especially for students from historically underrepresented groups. This study examines the influence of students’ belongingness and self-efficacy on their affective and behavioural response to active learning and the moderating influence of students’ gender-identity. We surveyed 579 students from 25 Science, Engineering, and Computer Science courses across 14 universities. Using a latent indirect-effect model, we found that belongingness and self-efficacy independently predicted students’ affective response to active learning and evaluation of the class. Belongingness also predicted students’ self-reports of their behavioural participation in active learning. Using measurement invariance, we also found that, despite mean differences in value, positivity, and distraction, there were no gender differences in the strength of relations between variables. These findings suggest that belongingness and self-efficacy play an important role in how all students respond to active learning and that fostering an atmosphere that supports both may reduce student’s resistance to engaging in active learning#FRE#
