#ITI#Task type completion in lower level EFL classes: A conversation analytic study#FTI#
#IRE# This study assesses a range of task-based interaction (i.e. structured vs. unstructured tasks) between lower-English-proficiency middle school English as a foreign language (EFL) learners in a task-based learning (TBL) class employing conversation analytic methodology. From the video data, which allowed for an emic analysis of the students’ vocal and non-vocal actions when engaging in the different task types, it was found that in both the structured and unstructured task interactions, because the students were mainly focused on task completion, there were frequent minimal turns and sequences. A deviant case analysis revealed that the participants prioritized task completion as the focus of activities even when engaging in social talk by evoking various types of roles (e.g. students, friends). The study proposes several pedagogical suggestions for employing tasks in lower-level EFL contexts.#FRE#
