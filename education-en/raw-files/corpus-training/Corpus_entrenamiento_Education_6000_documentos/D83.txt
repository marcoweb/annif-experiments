#ITI#Opening up learning environments: liking school among students in reformed learning spaces#FTI#
#IRE# The present study focuses on views of Finnish basic education students on open and flexible learning environments and the extent to which these views are associated with students’ liking of school. The data were based on an online questionnaire containing both structured ratings and open-ended questions filled out by primary school students (n = 684; grades 2–6; between ages 8–13 years) attending reformed learning environments. Ethnographic field notes and photographs of the schools were collected to provide contextual information about the settings. Quantitative analyses indicated that students had mostly positive evaluations of their renewed learning environments. Students’ perception of teacher support was significantly associated with their liking of school. The responses to open-ended questions, in contrast, indicated sources of dissatisfaction, and giving precedence to some aspects of traditional schools#FRE#
