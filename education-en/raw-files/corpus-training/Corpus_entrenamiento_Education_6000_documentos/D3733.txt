#ITI#The possible contribution of procrastination and perception of self-efficacy to academic achievement#FTI#
#IRE#While procrastination is a widely recognised phenomenon, current research sometimes contends that it is not by definition negative or that absence of procrastination is necessarily positive. Accordingly, a characterological distinction has been made between passive procrastinators and active procrastinators; the latter resembling non-procrastinators. The basis of this study derives from quantitative research, using three questionnaires in the survey method. A theoretical model whereby students’ perception of self-efficacy impacts procrastination was used to study 145 Master of Education (M.Ed) students in the process of writing their thesis in two Israeli Orthodox educational institutions. The findings revealed that the score for meeting deadlines was higher among non-procrastinators when compared to both types of procrastinators. No differences were found between students who actively procrastinate and those passively procrastinating, either with reference to self-efficacy or by measuring achievement. Procrastination strategies were identified as correlating with perceptions of self-efficacy (both general and academic) and final grades. Additionally, active procrastinators were found to be more academically procrastinators than passive procrastinators, while less studious. The declined hypotheses may be explained by reference to terms popular in Israeli culture, the inference being that active Israeli procrastinators do not plan their procrastination as carefully as do other westerners. Positive correlation was found between the theoretical model and the empirical data obtained from the questionnaires. However, self-efficacy, whose relationship to academic achievement is frequently emphasised, was not found to be a direct influence; rather it represents a factor mediated through procrastination#FRE#
