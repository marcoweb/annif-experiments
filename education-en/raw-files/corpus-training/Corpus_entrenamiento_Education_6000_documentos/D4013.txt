#ITI#Context-based learning in flipped middle school chemistry class#FTI#
#IRE#The study implements and investigates an innovative learning approach that incorporates Flipped Classroom (FC) methodologies and electronic assessment (e-assessment) in Context-Based Learning (CBL) in chemistry among middle school students. The study incorporated mixed methods strategies and (a) examined learners’ attitudes toward and perceptions of CBL in a hybrid environment in learning chemistry by using a structured, open-ended questionnaire; (b) examined learners’ awareness of the relevance of chemistry concepts and content to real-life and real-world situations by using a learning diary to examine activities initiated by the learners themselves; and (c) examined the correlation between learners’ achievements on online tasks and their achievements on a final written test. The findings revealed the students’ positive attitudes toward CBL in a hybrid environment using FC strategy. In addition, learning chemistry in a context-based approach helped learners see that the curriculum is relevant to phenomena that they encounter in real life and the real world. Furthermore, a strong correlation emerged between the learners’ achievements on the online assignments and their achievements on a conventional written test. This study adds knowledge about attitudes toward a context-based FC approach with e-assessments among middle school students, a population that has been the topic of very little exploration#FRE#
