#ITI#Reinventing Geometric Linear Transformations in a Dynamic Geometry Environment: Multimodal Analysis of Student Reasoning#FTI#
#IRE#This paper reports the multimodal resources that attached to students’ reasoning in the reinvention of specific geometric linear transformations (like reflections according to the axes, projections onto axes and composition of reflections) in a dynamic geometry environment. Following the design heuristics of Realistic Mathematics Education, we design a task (in ℝ2) referring to specific tools and functions of GeoGebra. Task-based interviews were conducted with a pair of linear algebra students, by way of a computer and a teacher. Data was collected using a video camera observing the students’ working environment, screen recorder software, student production and field notes. The data was analysed according to the multimodal paradigm focusing on all semiotic resources, such as gestures and artefact use, in addition to written signs. According to the findings, the artefact use, verbal and written mathematical expressions all interlaced with the emergence of gestures. The students mostly gestured when they faced a new reflection situation and when describing associated geometric actions. Finally, a shared environment with action, production and communication conveyed student reasoning and they managed to reinvent a number of geometric linear transformations#FRE#
