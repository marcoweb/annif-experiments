#ITI#Constructing global citizenship education at the regional level: regionalism and Caribbean citizen education#FTI#
#IRE#This conceptual paper examines the development of global citizenship education (GCE) by looking at economic regionalism’s political economy. First, this paper situates the Caribbean Community’s (CARICOM) citizenship education initiatives within the larger scope of global citizenship. Using a historical policy analysis, this article then explores the nexus between economic integration and the construction of citizenship by analysing CARICOM’s Human Resource Development (HRD) 2030 Strategy. In examining the HRD 2030 Strategy, it can be seen how the influence of both regional and global needs is being integrated into an initiative to standardise citizenship for an economically competitive Caribbean. Through the lens of neofunctionalism and intergovernmentalism, we reveal how the Ideal Caribbean Person initiative is a concept of regional citizenship created by regional economic policies and structural institutions. We conclude by arguing that the construction of global citizenship education at the regional level is, therefore, the consolidation of regional norms and their translation into a global context#FRE#
