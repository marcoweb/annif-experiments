#ITI#The sweeping incrementalism of Partnership Schools For Liberia#FTI#
#IRE# In the 2016–2017 school year, the Liberian government launched Partnership Schools For Liberia (PSL), a pilot program in which the management of 93 primary schools was transferred to 8 private contractors. The pilot owed much to the importation of western policy models and was facilitated by the British organisation ARK and involved BIA, a private school company who receive funding from US and British sources. Despite criticism from civil society, at the end of the first year a randomised control trial (RCT) reported that the PSL program led to a 60% increase in educational attainment. However, the framework of the RCT was not followed by many of the PSL contractors, who were able to draw on greater economic support than government schools, thus invalidating any claims that private management was superior to government based management of schools. For its part, the MoE further demonstrated low regard for the RCT, by announcing expansion before the evaluation had been released, signalling that the PSL (now renamed LEAP) was a policy enacted via sweeping incrementalism, in which procedures such as the RCT were only implemented to give the appearance of accountability, and that the plan to expand PSL was always the endgame#FRE#
