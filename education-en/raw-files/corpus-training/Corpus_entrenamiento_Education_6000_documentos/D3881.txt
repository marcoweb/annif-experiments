#ITI#Supporting Families from a Distance: Implementing Routines-Based Home Visits via Telepractice#FTI#
#IRE#Early intervention is a system of services designed to strengthen child outcomes and build family capacity. One approach of service provision is the Routines-Based Model which implements adult-learning practices wherein service providers and caregivers partner to build family-mediated interventions for children. Owing to COVID-19 and the benefits of telepractice, more and more service providers are likely to incorporate a telepractice modality into service provision. Because the Routines-Based Model uses family consultation, these home-visiting practices translate well to telepractice. In addition to consultation techniques, however, service providers must use technology advantageously to ensure effective communication practices. This article discusses technology uses in telepractice that can be incorporated in the Routines-Based Model, Tele-Routines-Based Home Visits, and examples of Tele-Routines-Based Home Visits. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023. corrected publication 2023.#FRE#
