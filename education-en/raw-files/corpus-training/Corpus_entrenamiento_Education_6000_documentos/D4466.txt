#ITI#Interconnected learning between university and the workplace: a socio-cultural perspective of graduate employability in the UK#FTI#
#IRE#Undergraduate students have been shown to spontaneously form communities of practice and social networks that support their learning and identity development. This study considers the translation of this participatory learning into professional employment following graduation. Thirteen former biological sciences students from a single UK university were interviewed following their successful transition into graduate level scientific employment. A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts revealed that these students did not learn new workplace practices from more experienced peers de novo, rather they negotiated changes to their existing university practices and hence were able to participate as newcomers to the joint enterprise of their workplace community of practice. Hence, students’ capacity for know how and know who knowledge has important implications for their employability, and this should be encouraged by maximising students’ exposure to co-participatory learning both within the university and in collaboration with local community projects#FRE#
