#ITI#Educator Perspectives on Mental Health Supports at the Primary Level#FTI#
#IRE#During the early years of formal education, young students develop a number of formative academic, motor, behavioral, and socioemotional skills that lay the foundation for future learning. Since student mental health in the early grades predicts academic achievement in later grades, mental health interventions are essential at the primary school level. Not only are teachers expected to provide academic instruction, they are now involved in providing students with mental health services, despite a lack of training to do so. The current study sought to gather the perspectives of 38 primary-level educators to gain understanding about mental health knowledge, current approaches to mitigating mental health challenges, and barriers that prevent them from successfully addressing student mental health issues. Using thematic analysis, three themes developed: (1) Educators indicate supporting primary students’ mental health is within their role; (2) Systems-level constraints prevent effective mental health supports; and (3) Staff desire increased mental health resources. Implications for educators and practice are discussed#FRE#
