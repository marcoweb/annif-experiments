#ITI#Rethinking Racial Diversity Benchmarks in Higher Education#FTI#
#IRE#Many institutions of higher learning aim to promote greater racial diversity to harness learning benefits and foster a sense of inclusion. Nevertheless, the institutional pursuit of racial diversity is difficult to benchmark. The current constitutional boundary limits the use of race to promote the diversity in college admissions to a “narrow,” “holistic,” and “case-by-case” strategy laden with definitional ambiguity. This ambiguity is deepened by constraints, such as institutional history, demographics, geography, and institutional rank, that often go unaccounted for in popular diversity measures. This article creates an expected diversity measure that describes the amount of racial diversity one would expect accounting for the home state of their incoming class. This initial step serves as an example that universities may follow when using their own internal data to account for a richer set of diversity constraints and to better monitor progress toward reaching their racial diversity goals. These measures can free universities from chasing unattainable external judgments on diversity targets, such as national benchmarks, thereby encouraging a more effective redistribution of resources for diversity-related outcomes#FRE#
