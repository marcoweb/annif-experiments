#ITI#Developing and validating the intention to use technology-enabled learning (I-TEL) scale#FTI#
#IRE# This article reports on the development and initial validation of the Intention to Use Technology-enabled Learning (I-TEL) Scale. Data from 313 preservice teachers were used to examine the instrument’s psychometric properties. Principal axis factoring (PAF) indicated a five-factor structure consisting of 22 items. The scale, as well as the subscales, indicated good internal consistency. Together, these tests indicate that the I-TEL is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring preservice teachers’ intention to use technology-enabled learning (TEL). Implications for teacher education research and practice are discussed#FRE#
