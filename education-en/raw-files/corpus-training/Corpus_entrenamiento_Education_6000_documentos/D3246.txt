#ITI#The History of Robotics and Implications for K-12 STEM Education#FTI#
#IRE#Robotics technologies are a significant tool in many industries. This paper presents a historical analysis of educational robots and how they apply to K-12 education from the past and potential in the future; focusing on the time period before and after the year 2000. The article concludes with future directions for curriculum and robotics in educational classrooms#FRE#
