#ITI#How to train students to engage in text-picture integration for multimedia lessons#FTI#
#IRE# This study investigated the effectiveness of visual training or verbal training on how to use a text-picture processing strategy for learning from computer-based multimedia instructional material. Sixty-nine university students were randomly assigned to the verbal training group (students received text-based instruction for a text-picture processing strategy), the visual training group (students observed a video depicting an expert's eye fixations while using a text-picture processing strategy for an initial portion of a multimedia lesson) or the control group (students did not receive any instruction). During reading a multimedia lesson on biology, students' eye movements were tracked; and after the lesson, students took a posttest. Concerning learning outcomes, both visual and verbal training helped students perform better than the control group on a recall test and the verbal training group perform better on a transfer test. Concerning learning processes, both visual and verbal training caused students to attend less to on-screen text and more to on-screen pictures as compared to the control group. Mediation analysis showed that increased attention to pictures was a mediator for better learning outcomes. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Pre-training on key concepts or terms improves learning, but little is known whether and how pre-training on strategy acquisition supports learning. Mayer's multimedia principle suggests people learn better from illustrated text than from text alone; however, learners sometimes fail to integrate text and picture. What this paper adds Pre-training on text-picture processing strategy is effective. Verbal and visual training foster text-picture processing strategy acquisition. Verbal training improves both recall and transfer test performance, and visual training improves only recall test performance. Verbal training is better in improving outcomes. Fixation time on pictures mediates the effects of training on learning outcomes. Implications for practice and/or policy Pre-training should be used to support learners' strategy acquisition. This study also provides suggestions on how to design pre-training on strategy acquisition#FRE#
