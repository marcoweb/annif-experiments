#ITI#Relative Proportional Reasoning: Transition from Additive to Multiplicative Thinking Through Qualitative and Quantitative Enmeshments#FTI#
#IRE#In their recent article on teachers’ proportional reasoning, Copur-Gencturk et al. (2022) draw attention to a type of strategy that they call “relative”, lodged right between additive and multiplicative thinking. This strategy raised interest in our research team, as it aligned well and helped give stronger meaning to some strategies obtained during a series of individual interviews on solving proportionality tasks. Using that “relative proportional reasoning” lens, this article explores several strategies engaged in by two students (11 and 13 years old) and in doing so outlines a number of dimensions about proportional reasoning that these strategies enable to draw out. The detailed consideration of this relative proportional reasoning raises important questions as to its possible role in the difficult transition from additive to multiplicative thinking in proportionality, opening the door to further inquiries on these matters#FRE#
