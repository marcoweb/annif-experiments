#ITI#What has been done to improve learning for intellectual disability? An umbrella review of published meta-analyses and systematic reviews#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Intellectual disability (ID) affects 1%–3% of the paediatric population. Currently, there is no consensus as to the most effective strategies for improving the learning skills of children and adolescents with ID. This review aims to systematically gather information regarding interventions to promote and improve learning skills in children/adolescents with ID from previously published systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Methods: Systematic search strategies, including appropriate descriptors, were employed on Medline, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of Science, Lilacs, SciELO, ERIC, and PsycINFO databases. Quality assessment was conducted via the AMSTAR-2. Results: Fifty-nine studies were selected, subdivided by outcome domains and by the type of intervention. Interventions were related to caregiving, education, pharmaco-dietary, physical, and technology approaches. The overall low quality of the studies limited our recommendations#FRE#
