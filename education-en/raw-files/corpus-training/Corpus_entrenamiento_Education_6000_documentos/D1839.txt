#ITI#Embodied preparation for learning basic quantum chemistry: A mixed-method study#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Haptic feedback has been shown to be an effective facilitator of the learning of scientific concepts in a series of studies. However, little is known about the underlying salient learning mechanisms, which are activated when learning from haptic feedback. Objectives: We investigate the learning mechanism in a higher chemistry education setting, in which the students learned about the abstract concept of potential energy in a quantum chemical context. Methods: In this work, we present a mixed-methods problem-solving prior to instruction (PS-I) study with chemistry bachelor students. In an interactive quantum chemistry learning environment, the students explored the energetic profiles of nucleophilic substitution reactions and the corresponding activation barriers experienced as repulsion and attraction. We measured cognitive and affective mechanisms which have been shown to be activated in PS-I designs, such as knowledge gap awareness, state curiosity, and positive affect as well as the learning outcome quantitatively and the learning trajectories qualitatively. Results and Conclusions: Planned contrasts revealed a small hindering effect of the haptic feedback on the learning outcome. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data lets us attribute this effect to the lack of scaffolding of the haptic feedback and the spontaneous atomic movements in the simulation, which may be interpreted as a visual representation of force in itself. This work highlights the importance of accurate mappings of the haptic feedback unto the target domain and further delivers insight into the prior conceptions of chemistry undergraduate students#FRE#
