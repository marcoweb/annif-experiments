#ITI#Culturally Inclusive STEM Learning: Mentored Internships for Native American Undergraduates at a Tribal College and a University#FTI#
#IRE#The focus of this research is on Native American students participating in science internships in tribal college and university settings. Drawing on data collected through annual evaluations of two Science, Technology, Engineering, Math (STEM) internship programs over a number of years, one at a tribal college and one at a university, the research presented in this article addresses the following questions: How do the science internship experiences of Native college students differ in the tribal college and university settings? Which program elements facilitate the most successful science internship experiences? What meanings and impacts do Native students identify for the science internships they experience in these two different higher education contexts? Our analyses indicate similar perspectives among interns about the value of their mentors and the collaborative STEM research experiences which increased their skills and the confidence needed to contribute to research and to pursue higher education degrees. Although differences in the internship programs included specific research opportunities, the skills required, and mentor responsibilities, the two programs were ultimately complementary. Both the tribal college and university programs created spaces for Native student engagement with STEM fields. As a result, interns typically felt that the internships benefitted their individual schooling and would benefit their home communities through their own contributions and future mentorship of others#FRE#
