#ITI#Playing the Game Just Enough: How Racially Minoritized Faculty Who Advance Equity Conceptualize Success in the Neoliberal Academy#FTI#
#IRE#The increasing neoliberalization of institutions of higher education poses several challenges for racially minoritized faculty who advocate equity. Unfortunately, explorations of how neoliberalism shapes the realities of these faculty are sparse. This study analyzes some of the ways in which neoliberal systems and the resistance of racially minoritized faculty advocating equity conceptualize their own success in the academy. In-depth, face-to-face, individual interviews were conducted with 12 racially minoritized faculty members advocating equity at predominantly white institutions (PWIs) in the Rocky Mountain region. Findings reveal that these faculty conceptualize success as meeting neoliberal expectations defined by quantifiable metrics of productivity, fulfilling commitments to having a positive impact, and cultivating agency to express voice for positive change. Findings also illuminate how participants found themselves in precarious situations where they feel an overwhelming pressure to balance the neoliberal demands of the academy and their desire to make a broader and more meaningful impact. Implications for research and practice outline how stakeholders within institutions of higher education can support racially minoritized faculty members’ success in the academy#FRE#
