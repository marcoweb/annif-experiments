#ITI#Negotiating identities in western academia: an autoethnographic study of international doctoral students in Australia#FTI#
#IRE# This study is a critical-autoethnographic exploration of the intellectual trajectories of three international doctoral scholars in an Australian research-intensive university in terms of the development of their academic identities. It looks at the various institutional and discursive forces that influence their academic adjustments and how they navigate their intellectual and scholarly journeys while studying abroad. In particular, the paper investigates the tensions inherent in the intersection of institutional governmentality and individual sense of empowerment within and outside the third space. International doctoral students experience both overt and covert pressures to conform and accept institutional norms to ‘fit in’ when coming to study in Australia. Rather than simply adapting, they also ‘fight out’ against these norms, thereby reconfiguring their academic identities through interactions with supervisors, senior colleagues, and wider academia. Using narratives from their learning experiences, the study locates the interface of these two forces and the creation of a third space–emerging from how these three novice scholars bring in their own learning academic conventions from their home countries in an Australian academic community. This research has implications for understanding international doctoral students’ stories of becoming academics#FRE#
