#ITI#Science students' social bonds and knowledge construction#FTI#
#IRE# Emerging research is beginning to explore the role of social bonds in science learning. In this study, I develop a novel conceptual framework extending recent science education research that has adopted Scheff's social bond theory in understanding science learning. I use microsociological methods to understand social bonds and knowledge construction as contemporaneous phenomena through analysis of interactional dynamics. Drawing on ethnomethodology and an interpretive paradigm, I analyze multiple data sources including video recordings of group interactions, social bond diaries, reflective discussions, and social bond quizzes to understand how a student group cocreates science knowledge and how the same social practices co-construct social bond status within the group. Complexity in the nature of trio's interactions highlights the need for researchers to produce holistic understandings of knowledge construction and social bonds. Implications for future research on social bonds and their role in science learning experiences are offered#FRE#
