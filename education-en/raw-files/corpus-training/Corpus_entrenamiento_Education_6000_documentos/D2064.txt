#IRE# Over the past years, there has been an increasing prevalence of ‘nudge thinking’ in the educational field. While (critical) research on the rising adoption of nudging has increasingly proliferated in the broader social sciences over the past decades, nudging in education–what we designate here as –is, however, only starting to be given substantial academic attention and still requires more nuanced conceptual and empirical investigation. As we argue in this contribution, such investigations should not only carefully disentangle the enormous complexity of nudging in education, including the role of digital and automated technologies. Equally, they should take more systematically into account the traditional closeness of the fields of pedagogy and behavioral insights. In line with that argumentation, the goal of this article is to develop foundations of such an  research program, focusing on four different dimensions: the technomodalities, the political economy, the spacetimes, and the pedagogies of #FRE#
