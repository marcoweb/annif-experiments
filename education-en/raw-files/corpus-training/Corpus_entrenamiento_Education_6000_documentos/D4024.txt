#ITI#Virtual reality in the HE classroom: feasibility, and the potential to embed in the curriculum#FTI#
#IRE#Learner engagement is a challenge within Geography education, and Higher Education more generally and immersive Virtual Reality (VR) has a wealth of possibilities, but finding simple, straightforward applications that are also pedagogically worthwhile can be a challenge. Three trial runs of full earth simulations in VR in classroom environments were conducted using high-end VR hardware. The trials were conducted with Geography and Digital Humanities students and the aim was to evaluate the use of immersive VR would enhance learner engagement. The technology acceptance model was used to some extent to get appropriate survey data and an inductive approach to thematic analysis was applied. Based on the data collected there seemed a reasonable evidence base that students found the tool relatively easy to use and it enhanced their understanding and engagement. The findings are in line with those of previous studies which show that immersive VR environments create a strong sense of perceived presence which leads to higher learner engagement and motivation. Challenges for greater adoption are also presented#FRE#
