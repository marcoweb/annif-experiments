#ITI#Teacher and School Predictors of Teacher Deprofessionalization and Demoralization in the United States#FTI#
#IRE# The purpose of this study is to examine changes in teachers’ perception of their work during key periods of the accountability and assessment policy movement in the United States. We utilize a teacher perception of deprofessionalization and demoralization framework operationalized using the restricted Schools and Staffing Surveys data sets from 1993-1994 through 2011-2012 to examine changes in teachers’ perception of their work. Using multiple group hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) we find that teacher deprofessionalization and demoralization increased from the state- to federal-level accountability periods. We also find that there are significant predictors of deprofessionalization and demoralization at the teacher level and school level.#FRE#
