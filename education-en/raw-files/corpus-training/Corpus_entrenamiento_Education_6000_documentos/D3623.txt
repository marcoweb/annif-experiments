#ITI#Cognitive reserve proxies for individuals with intellectual developmental disability: A scoping review#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Cognitive reserve (CR) has not been studied in people with Intellectual Developmental Disability, a population with a high incidence of dementia. Commonly adopted CR proxies should be adapted to reflect more specifically the experiences of people with Intellectual Developmental Disability. Method: This scoping review intended to identify CR proxies relevant to people with this condition. Results: Some of these were the same already detected in a population without intellectual disabilities (education, occupation, physical activity, leisure, community and social activities); others were found to be specifically relevant for this population: type of schooling, parental educational level, environmental stimulation and living place. Conclusions: These proxies need to be considered in studies on CR and Intellectual Developmental Disability and in clinical practice. Research on the protective effect of CR aims to encourage policies promoting lifestyle-based educational and preventive interventions and overcome participation barriers for people with Intellectual Developmental Disability#FRE#
