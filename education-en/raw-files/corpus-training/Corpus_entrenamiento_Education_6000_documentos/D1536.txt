#ITI#Motivation towards novel learning content: Perceived similarity of learning content, but not need for cognition, moderates the generalization of motivation#FTI#
#IRE# Background: The generalization of established motivation hypothesis states that individuals use established motivational beliefs to predict motivational beliefs regarding novel learning content on the basis of the perceived similarity between academic domains. Aims: This study tests the generalization hypothesis by investigating the assumed moderating role of the extent of perceived similarity between known and novel learning content and need for cognition (NFC). Sample(s): Participants were adult students (n = 576) from various study programs (Study 1) and non-students (n = 628) of whom the majority held at least a bachelor's degree (Study 2). Methods: In this prospective correlational survey study, we used online self-report measures to assess participants’ self-concept of ability (SCA) and intrinsic task value (ITV) regarding their established and anticipated motivational beliefs regarding a set of school subjects (known learning content) and fields of study (novel learning content), perceptions of similarity, and their NFC. Data was analysed using structural equation modelling with latent interaction variables. Results: We found support for the generalization hypothesis and documented that the perceived similarity moderated the generalizing effect (i.e., SCA and ITV had stronger predictive validity for learning content that was perceived as more similar). However, the results obtained for the moderating effect of NFC were mostly nonsignificant. Conclusion: Individuals generalize established motivation regarding known learning content to anticipated motivation regarding novel learning content perceived as being similar. The extent of perceived similarity enhances this effect, whereas NFC does not. Future research should address the underlying automatic and deliberate cognitive processes of generalization#FRE#
