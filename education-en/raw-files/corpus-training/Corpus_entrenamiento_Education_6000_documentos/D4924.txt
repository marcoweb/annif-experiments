#ITI#Promoting At-Promise Student Success in 4-Year Universities: Recommendations From the Thompson Scholars Learning Communities#FTI#
#IRE#In this practice brief, we offer recommendations for practitioners supporting low-income students, firstgeneration college students, students of color, and/or students who are academically underprepared. We focus specifically on practices related to students’ psychosocial well-being. Our recommendations are based on a multiyear, mixed methods evaluation of a comprehensive college transition program, as well as promising practices emerging from similar programs. We highlight the importance of offering multiple forms of proactive support, utilizing academically validating practices in the classroom, and customizing programs based on a campus’s unique student body#FRE#
