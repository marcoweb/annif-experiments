#ITI#From Symbolic Manipulations to Stepwise Instructions: A Curricular Comparison of Swedish School Algebra Content over the Past 40 Years#FTI#
#IRE#Although there have been a huge number of attempts to improve school algebra teaching, several countries are still struggling to improve students algebraic skills. In this study, we focus on the specific case of Sweden where students for several decades have had major problems mastering algebra. In order to get a better understanding of the Swedish situation, we consider what constitutes Swedish school algebra by investigating the development of algebraic content in the Swedish mathematics curriculum documents over the past 40 years. The results reveal that the connection between arithmetic and algebra, the so-called generalized arithmetic, is almost absent in all three curricula although researchers argue that generalized arithmetic is one of the most relevant topics within early algebra. Instead, Sweden has chosen a unique approach as programming, with a specific focus on stepwise instructions and algorithms, recently has been implemented within the core content of algebra#FRE#
