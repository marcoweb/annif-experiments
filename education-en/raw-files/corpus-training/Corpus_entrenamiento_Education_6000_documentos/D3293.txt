#ITI#Exploring Teacher and Student Stereotypes in a Gender-Inclusive Secondary Computer Science Program#FTI#
#IRE#While a growing emphasis has been placed on broadening participation in computer science (CS) education, an enduring gender gap exists. One reason for this is gender-based CS stereotypes, which serve as gatekeepers and act in exclusionary ways. However, some high schools in the U.S. have still built gender-inclusive CS programs. We conducted a 3-month long case study at one such school (Forest View High School, FVHS, pseudonym) to better understand existing stereotypes. Data sources included student and alumnae interviews, student reflections, and teacher interviews. Constant comparative analysis was used to uncover emergent themes. Overall, gender-based stereotypes did not appear to be present, potentially as a result of mitigating strategies like access to women role models and recognition of the importance of a growth mindset. However, nerd-genius stereotypes were common. Despite a focus on nerd-genius stereotypes, students also held perceptions that computer scientists could be any type of person. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2024.#FRE#
