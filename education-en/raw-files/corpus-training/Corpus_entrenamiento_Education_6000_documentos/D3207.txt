#ITI#Investigating CS Teacher Licensure in Indiana#FTI#
#IRE#This study aims to investigate the licensure status of computer science teachers in Indiana by examining teacher licensure data as it relates to school locale and school demographics across the state. Results indicate that there is no significant difference in the presence of teachers with CS-Related or Approved licenses across schools with various locale designations and demographic (ethnic and economic) compositions. It is a positive indication that there are no glaring disparities in access to well-prepared CS teachers across student groups. This also provides an opportunity to investigate additional factors that may shed light on future areas of focus#FRE#
