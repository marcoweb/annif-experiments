#ITI#Post-secularism muting controversy: school-NGO interactions in Israel through the prism of stakeholder salience theory#FTI#
#IRE#Elaborating on stakeholder salience theory, this study aims to explore the different agendas and modus operandi of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) within the Israeli public education system. This article is part of a larger study, focused on NGOs that offer services within the secular state education sector in the field of ‘Jewish (religious) identity.’ Through a case study of one such organisation in particular comprised of several units, we attempt to understand the different processes, actors and interests at play, based on data from semi-structured interviews with NGO representatives, school leadership and parents. Using a dynamic view of stakeholder salience theory, we identify the different actors involved and classify their roles in the various relationships. The complex Israeli context and focus on religious NGOs offer us a unique perspective on the role of organisations offering services within the Israeli school system and society in general. We find the expected controversy over these NGOs’ presence in secular schools to have been muted by a convergence of opinions resulting from Israeli ‘post-secularism.’#FRE#
