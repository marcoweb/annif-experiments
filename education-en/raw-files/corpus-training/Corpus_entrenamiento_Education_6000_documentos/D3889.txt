#ITI#Wishful LINKing: Authentic Environmental Measures Aligned with Programmatic Purposes#FTI#
#IRE#There are multiple measurement tools that can be used to assess early childhood environments. To verify whether authentic and contextual/environmental measures have empirical support, test manuals and the literature base should be examined to determine psychometric properties and appropriateness of the instrument for a diverse population of children. Professionals may not have resources, training, or time to conduct their own research. A research synthesis may offer guidance. A growing body of research is informing how environmental measurement performs in various contexts. The current study examined 28 environmental/contextual measures that met environments (e.g., classroom criteria which focused on aspects of authentic early childhood, materials, human interactions, etc.). We found 63 studies that met criteria for this research synthesis on environmental/contextual measures. Measures that had the most available evidence were: Arnett CIS, CLASS, ECERS-3, PAS, RBI, and TPOT. Some measures are new in their development and have not yet acquired a body of research. Findings have implications for aligning measurement to programmatic purposes in early childhood education#FRE#
