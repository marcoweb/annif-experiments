#ITI#Learning in high-performance action sports: insights into new and evolving contexts#FTI#
#IRE# Background and Purpose: Participation rates in many organised sports are stagnating, yet a rapid growth in participation, commercialisation and institutionalisation has been observed in self-organised sports such as surfing, snowboarding skateboarding, BMX racing and rock climbing over the past five decades. These sports are continuously attracting attention both in commercial and academic domains partially attributable to their inclusion in global mega events such as the Olympic Games. The continued inclusion in the programme provides opportunities for the sports to maintain their route to professionalisation, and for professionals (i.e. athletes, coaches) to explore their learning within newly emerging contexts. Despite the mainstreaming of many action sports and their inclusion in the Winter and Summer Olympic programmes, the learning of action sports athletes within the high performance context has rarely been studied. Particularly scarce is research considering the athlete’s voice. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to explore the learning experiences of elite action sports athletes in high-performance environments. Data collection and analysis: A qualitative multiple-case study approach was chosen so as to gain an in-depth understanding of the athletes’ learning experiences in ways that captured the highly idiosyncratic nature of learning. The cases were four senior elite BMX Supercross (SX) racers from a successful national team. Data were generated through semi-structured interviews, online and face-to-face observations, and document analysis. Data were collated and thematically analysed to support rich and in-depth accounts of each of the cases. Findings from this research were discussed adopting a theoretically eclectic approach. Findings and Discussion: Findings from this study indicate that BMX SX athletes (re-)learned, through engagements with the head coach, how to be independent learners. In addition, experiences in high quality performance hubs tended to proffer some of the most valued learning opportunities for elite BMX SX riders. Here, the athletes learned to become accustomed to the performance environment and continued to fine-tune their race craft. Finally, findings from this study suggest that BMX SX athletes learned with and from their social relationships, however, not all social engagements resulted in valued learning. This research extends an understanding of learning in action sports, taking into consideration learning as idiosyncratic, socially and contextually situated, and ongoing, as a basis for further inquiry into learning in high performance action sports#FRE#
