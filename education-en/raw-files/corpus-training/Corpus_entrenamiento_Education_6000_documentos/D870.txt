#ITI#Pedagogy, Partnership, and Collaboration: A Longitudinal, Empirical Study of Serious Educational Gameplay in Secondary Biology Classrooms#FTI#
#IRE# The use of serious educational games has the potential to increase student learning outcomes in science education by providing students with opportunities to explore phenomena in ways that vary from traditional instruction; yet, empirical research to support this assertion is limited. This study aimed to explore deeply what learning gains were associated with the use of three serious educational games (SEGs) created for use in secondary biology classrooms that partner teachers implemented during a 2-week curriculum unit. This longitudinal, mixed method study includes a control year, in which we examined how six highly qualified teachers taught students (n = 407) a 2-week curriculum unit addressing cellular biology without the SEGs, followed by 2 years in which the teachers integrated the SEGs into the curriculum unit with students (n =871). Data were collected from multiple sources, including a validated content pre- and post-test measure, embedded gameplay data, participant observation, teacher interviews, and focus groups. Quantitative findings showed significant learning gains associated with students who experienced the game condition during year 2, when compared with the control condition. During the replication year (year 3), learning gains increased again, compared with year two. Although the SEGs did not change between years 2 and 3, teachers were provided real-time access to students’ performance during gameplay. Thematic analysis of observation notes, teacher interviews, and student performance in-game identified four affordances teachers identified related to the use of serious educational games in their classrooms and the extended partnership model employed. Implications for researchers and game designers are discussed#FRE#
