#ITI#Maternal attachment and behaviour problems: comparison between children in regular and special education schools#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of the current investigation was to compare the association between attachment and behaviour problems in children attending regular schools and children attending special education schools with a focus on emotional and social development. We draw upon data collected from 169 children attending regular schools (Mage = 9.66), and 91 children attending special education schools (Mage= 10.52). The children completed the Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Revised (ECR-RC), which assess their maternal attachment-related anxiety and avoidance. Parents completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL/6-18 R) which captures their child’s internalising and externalising problems. Special education children showed higher levels of attachment-related anxiety and avoidance, than regular education children. Furthermore, regular and special education children showed different associations between attachment and internalising and externalising problems. Our results have implications for the transferability of previous research findings from children without to children with special needs and highlight the importance of considering maternal attachment for children attending special education schools#FRE#
