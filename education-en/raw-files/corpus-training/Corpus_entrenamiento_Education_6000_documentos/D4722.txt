#ITI#Smart Groups: A system to orchestrate collaboration in hybrid learning environments. A simulation study#FTI#
#IRE#COVID-19 has brought new hybrid learning environments with some students in the classroom and some others online, synchronously, due to the needs of social distancing. These new hybrid learning environments pose new challenges, for example for group collaboration. This paper presents Smart Groups, a system aimed at helping teachers to orchestrate collaboration in hybrid learning environments and assesses its usability and usefulness through a simulation study. Smart Groups identifies the students that are in the classroom and online, automates the creation of groups (recommending collaborative learning flow patterns to teachers and considering the previous work done by students), supports the communication among students and the use of additional tools and resources for collaboration, and helps maintain the safety distance among the students who are in the classroom. The usability of Smart Groups has been assessed through a mock-up by 60 users (41 students and 19 teachers) with the system usability scale (SUS) obtaining good results (mean = 75.47, standard deviation = 14.95, median = 76.25). A subgroup (10 teachers out of 19) carried out follow-up interviews using the technology acceptance model (TAM) and highlighted the usefulness of Smart Groups to orchestrate collaboration in hybrid learning environments. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
