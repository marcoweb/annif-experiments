#ITI#Understanding social entrepreneurial intention in higher education: does gender and type of study matter?#FTI#
#IRE# Social entrepreneurship is a research topic that has received great attention from academics especially in recent years. However, the results in the literature are far from univocal, for example, there is no clear conceptual delimitation of the term, and it is often analyzed using the same theoretical models of traditional entrepreneurship. With the present study, we have attempted to overcome this problem by analyzing different antecedents, closer to the social and emotional universe, and detached from a male-centric and traditional vision of entrepreneurship, with the aim of understanding social entrepreneurial intentions in higher education. Results obtained from a sample of 962 college students showed that prior experience with social problems (PESP) and empathy (EMP) have a significant and positive impact on social entrepreneurial intention (SEI). Furthermore, social self-efficacy (SES-E), moral obligation (MO), and perceived social support (PSS), in addition to directly influencing SEI, mediated the relationship between PESP-SEI, and the relationship between EMP-SEI. More interestingly, gender (male vs female), but not the different type of study (social sciences vs economics and business sciences), moderated the relationship between EMP-SEI to the benefit of women. Given the importance of social entrepreneurship as an alternative solution to the current economic crisis, these are important results because, on the one hand, they make it possible to overcome the male-female gap that characterizes traditional entrepreneurship, on the other, they underline the need to introduce different constructs closer to the social and emotional sphere into entrepreneurship education programs#FRE#
