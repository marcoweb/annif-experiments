#ITI#China's policy responses to university ranking: changes and new challenges#FTI#
#IRE#Global university rankings have reshaped the landscape of higher education (HE) across various parts of the globe. The intensified competition stirred by these rankings has significantly affected academic lifestyles. The quest for global university rankings has also inevitably increased the degree of homogenisation amongst universities. Given the negative impact of global university rankings on university development, these rankings have been criticised as game playing, whilst some countries and institutions are beginning to withdraw themselves from the competition. This article sets out against the above context to review Chinese government's response to the challenges and its policy changes. Findings suggest policy responses occur very differently in different areas. Instead of simply following the rules and criteria set by global university rankings, China is trying to set its own criteria. This article contributes to the theoretical and practical understanding of China's responses to the global rankings#FRE#
