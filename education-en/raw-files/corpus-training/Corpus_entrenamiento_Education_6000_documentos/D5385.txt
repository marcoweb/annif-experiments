#ITI#Stressors from and well-being after COVID-19 among Danish primary and lower secondary school students#FTI#
#IRE#Due to COVID-19, 2020 was a strange and different school year for many students around the world. Based on a survey of primary school students (N = 2665) conducted in December 2020, this article examines students’ well-being and stress levels one year after the first COVID-19 outbreak. It also examines how students emotionally relate to the pandemic after a year with a large number of persistent stressors caused by school closures and re-openings. The article indicates that at a general level, COVID-19 seems to be a moderate stressor for students, but a number of specific stressors are identified. The article shows that well-being and stress levels vary among different groups of students, and it finds that there is a group of almost a third of the students that we should pay special attention to. Finally, the article identifies eight themes in how the students relate, negatively and positively, to the pandemic#FRE#
