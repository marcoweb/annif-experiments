#ITI#Digital teaching platforms: the use of dynamic functions to express mathematical content#FTI#
#IRE#This article explores how seven Swedish digital teaching platforms in mathematics make use of the affordances provided by various modalities and dynamic functions. A model based on social semiotics is used to analyse how dynamic functions are used, whether or not the language is technically oriented, if relational or operational processes are emphasised, and the logic in the text. The analysis focuses on how the dynamic elements in teaching materials are used and potential consequences of their use. The results reveal a tendency to predominantly allocate dynamic and interactive elements to tasks related to theoretical parts and examples, and also that the most common dynamic element, film, has substantial potential to support meaning-making in several respects. For example, a voice-over can easily contribute a personal touch, add further logic to the content, or give an explanation based on an operational process#FRE#
