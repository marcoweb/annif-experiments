#ITI#From guides to jugglers, from audience to outsiders: a metaphor analysis of synchronous hybrid learning#FTI#
#IRE#Synchronous hybrid learning (SHL) is a new instructional approach that allows on-site and remote students to participate in learning activities simultaneously. Investigating metaphorical perceptions about new learning environments may offer insights into the ways in which they are perceived by various stakeholders. Yet, research is missing a thorough investigation into metaphorical perceptions about hybrid learning environments. Hence, our goal was to determine and compare the metaphorical perceptions of higher education instructors and students regarding their roles in face-to-face versus SHL environments. When asked about SHL, participants were asked to refer separately to the on-site and remote student roles. Following the mixed-methods research design, data were obtained from 210 higher education instructors and students who responded to an online questionnaire during the 2021 academic year. Findings showed that both groups perceived their roles differently in face-to-face versus SHL. For instructors, the “guide” metaphor was replaced with the “juggler” and the “counselor” metaphors. For students, the “audience” metaphor was replaced with different metaphors for each cohort of learners. The on-site students were described as an active audience, while the remote students were described as outsiders or observers. The meaning of these metaphors will be discussed in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on teaching and learning in contemporary higher education. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
