#ITI##Digital parents: Intergenerational learning through a digital literacy workshop#FTI#
#IRE# In this article, we present findings of a research study centered around a 10-week digital production workshop developed specifically for families in an urban school board, a population rich with culturally diverse immigrant families and English language learners (ELLs). The aim of this research was to support parents/guardians in an urban community in their development of a practical, hands-on understanding of twenty-first century literacies, using a ‘production pedagogy’ framework that emphasizes learner agency. We sought to critically reflect, alongside parents/guardians, on how new media and new literacies are being utilized in schools today, and to provide models, tools and practices for parents/guardians and their children to enact digital competences together, specifically, through the production of a short digital story#FRE#
