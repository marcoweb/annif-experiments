#ITI#Tablet-to-student ratio matters: Learning performance and mental experience of collaborative inquiry#FTI#
#IRE# The use of virtual manipulatives (VMs) in tablets has become increasingly popular in science courses, and previous studies have indicated its educational benefits. However, the tablet-to-student ratio (TSR), which may affect students’ learning, has rarely been examined. This study compares how learning in groups with different TSRs influences the learning performance and mental experience of elementary school students. Participants were 117 fifth-grade students who were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1:1 (i.e., each student had one tablet) and Group 1:m (i.e., each group shared one tablet) to learn the topic of triboelectrification. The results demonstrated that the students with a 1:m TSR performed better than those with a 1:1 TSR in terms of group work; that students with a 1:m TSR showed a higher degree of involvement during collaborative inquiries; and that the retention test, cognitive load, and group-process satisfaction results showed no significant difference between the two conditions. The findings indicate that the positive effect of collaboration on individuals may gradually disappear and the tradeoff between TSR and time of intervention should be considered during instruction#FRE#
