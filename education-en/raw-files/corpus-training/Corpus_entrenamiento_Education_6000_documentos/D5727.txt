#ITI#Collaboration between special education teachers and visual arts education teachers in working with pupils with severe specific learning difficulties and its relationship to professional development#FTI#
#IRE#Collaboration among different teacher profiles is one of the most important factors in meeting the needs of pupils with special needs. In a study of 138 teachers from different regions of Slovenia (57 special education teachers and 85 visual art teachers), we investigated how they collaborate when working with pupils with severe specific learning difficulties and how this collaboration relates to their professional development. The online questionnaire survey found that most participating professionals felt that collaboration was necessary, and 25% had not yet collaborated. Those who have collaborated most often consult informally in hallways and work as a team in expert groups for individualised programmes. The most common team teaching approach is for the visual arts teacher to lead the art class and the special education teacher to assist the teacher by providing support to the pupils with and without learning difficulties. They also see many benefits for the pupils and themselves in this type of collaboration and follow the desirable - positive - side of the S model of professional development. An analysis of the situation in practise can form the basis for recommendations on how to promote professional development in collaboration between these pedagogical professionals#FRE#
