#ITI#Validity of school-level environment questionnaire (SLEQ): a case of high school teachers in Vietnam#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of School-Level Environment Questionnaire (SLEQ) in the Vietnam context. The study tested the nomological validity of the main measurement model and a competing model. The participants included 29 interviewees and 408 Vietnamese high-school teachers in Ho Chi Minh City. Interview data were used to seek preliminary support for the measurement model and indicators. Survey data were analyzed employing Exploratory Factor Analysis, Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modelling. A 9-dimension SLEQ with 38 indicators was validated. The dimensions of school climate have various effects on teachers’ job satisfaction. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
