#ITI#Effectively supporting teachers: a peer supervision model using reflective circles#FTI#
#IRE#Teachers are faced with an increasingly complex environment in which they need significant support to foster the classroom climates their students benefit from. Developing a critical understanding of the school and broader social context can foster awareness of the ‘bigger picture’ that influences the school community individually and collectively. This article explores research in three schools in Victoria, Australia that used a reflective circles model to explore challenging classroom and school experiences. Separate groups of 4–6 teachers or principals volunteered to participate in the reflective circles with each circle taking about 1–1.5 hours. The initial findings from interviews with nine teacher participants and three principals affirm the value of the circles for generating significant mutual support, awareness of other perspectives and strategies and building confidence and capacity to seek change. What emerged suggests the value of a peer supervision model based on critically reflective practice to support, enable, empower and foster a sense of agency for teachers and principals#FRE#
