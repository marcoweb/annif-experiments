#ITI#Immersive virtual reality to train preservice teachers in managing students' challenging behaviours: A pilot study#FTI#
#IRE# This pilot study investigated the effects of immersive virtual reality (VR) training on the classroom management ability of preservice teachers, the addition of real-time audio feedback as reinforcement and whether preservice teachers could apply their training in an actual classroom setting. We employed the Breaking Bad Behaviours' immersive VR system to design a training situation. Managing students' challenging behaviours was the training target, and 10 preservice teachers were invited to participate (five men and five women; age range, 20–26 years). The results revealed that the immersive VR training experience improved the speed and effectiveness of the participants' management of challenging behaviours in students and enabled the participants to transfer their learning to an actual classroom setting. After the training, the teachers were more confident in halting challenging behaviours by approaching the students, taking appropriate actions and using oral commands. Real-time audio feedback had a positive but weak influence and gave the participants a feeling of encouragement and affirmation regarding their actions; the influence of real-time feedback is expected to be stronger if the target of the reinforcement is focused on specific classroom management strategies. Finally, more interactive student avatars should be added to the immersive VR system to enhance classroom management communication, thus making the system a more effective teacher training tool. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Virtual reality (VR) provides a high degree of realism that increases the effectiveness of teacher training simulations. Desktop VR technology has been applied in professional development for classroom management; few studies have used immersive VR for classroom management training. What this paper adds The immersive virtual training experience could improve preservice teachers' ability to handle students' challenging behaviours, and the classroom management ability learned through immersive VR can be transferred to a real classroom. Real-time audio feedback can encourage preservice teachers and provide a feeling of achievement and affirm their actions. Implications for practice and/or policy Immersive VR simulations can be used as a training tool to provide preservice teachers with authentic classroom management practice experience. Through careful design, real-time audio feedback can be incorporated into the immersive virtual simulation process to reinforce the target behaviours#FRE#
