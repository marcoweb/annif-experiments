#ITI#Selection tools and student diversity in health professions education: a multi-site study#FTI#
#IRE# Student diversity in health professions education (HPE) can be affected by selection procedures. Little is known about how different selection tools impact student diversity across programs using different combinations of traditional and broadened selection criteria. The present multi-site study examined the chances in selection of subgroups of applicants to HPE undergraduate programs with distinctive selection procedures, and their performance on corresponding selection tools. Probability of selection of subgroups (based on gender, migration background, prior education, parental education) of applicants (N = 1935) to five selection procedures of corresponding Dutch HPE undergraduate programs was estimated using multilevel logistic regression. Multilevel linear regression was used to analyze performance on four tools: prior-education grade point average (pe-GPA), biomedical knowledge test, curriculum-sampling test, and curriculum vitae (CV). First-generation Western immigrants and applicants with a foreign education background were significantly less likely to be selected than applicants without a migration background and with pre-university education. These effects did not vary across programs. More variability in effects was found between different selection tools. Compared to women, men performed significantly poorer on CVs, while they had higher scores on biomedical knowledge tests. Applicants with a non-Western migration background scored lower on curriculum-sampling tests. First-generation Western immigrants had lower CV-scores. First-generation university applicants had significantly lower pe-GPAs. There was a variety in effects for applicants with different alternative forms of prior education. For curriculum-sampling tests and CVs, effects varied across programs. Our findings highlight the need for continuous evaluation, identifying best practices within existing tools, and applying alternative tools#FRE#
