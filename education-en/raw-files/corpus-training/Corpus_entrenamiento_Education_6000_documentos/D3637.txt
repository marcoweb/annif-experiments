#ITI#Accessibility and feasibility of experience sampling methods for mental health research with people with intellectual disability: Scoping of research and stakeholder views#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Experience sampling may be useful for mental health research with people with intellectual disability, and evidence of the potential benefits is starting to emerge. This multiple-method study identified potential avenues for tailoring this method to the needs of people with intellectual disability. Method: A scoping review was conducted. Five databases were searched for experience sampling studies involving people with intellectual disability. In addition, seven adults with an intellectual disability tested experience sampling apps with standardised questions about mental health and were interviewed about their experiences in semi-structured interviews. Results: Seven studies were included in the scoping review. Two studies investigated acceptability and feasibility. In the interviews, participants reported on the acceptability, availability, and appropriateness of experience sampling applications. Conclusions: There are still important gaps in knowledge about acceptability, availability, and appropriateness of experience sampling for this population. Researchers are recommended to tailor experience sampling applications to the needs and interests of individual users#FRE#
