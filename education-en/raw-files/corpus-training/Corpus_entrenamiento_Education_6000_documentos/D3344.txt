#ITI#The impact of neoliberal globalisation on (global) citizenship teacher education in Norway#FTI#
#IRE#Norway has been going through numerous changes in its education system. In the last 10 years, Norway has retrained its teachers to obtain master’s degrees, redrawn its curricula objectives, and instated national exams for certain subjects. These changes are occurring at a time of intensified globalisation and increased displacement of people. With these changes in mind, the article examines policy documents and social studies standards in the New Knowledge Promotion curriculum, and conversations with teacher educators to understand the factors that shape conceptions of (global) citizenship education. A central finding is that teacher education is depoliticised and promotes an imagined, neoliberal political harmony#FRE#
