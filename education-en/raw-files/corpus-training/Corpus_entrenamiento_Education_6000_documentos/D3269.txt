#ITI#The Evolution of Technology for the Mathematics Classroom#FTI#
#IRE#This article will provide a historical perspective on the use of technology in education by focusing on the field of mathematics education. It will focus specifically on two technologies - presentation tools and calculating tools - and will explore their history and evolution as an example of how technological change, while not dramatically upending pedagogy, has gradually altered classroom practice#FRE#
