#ITI#Supporting a T-Shaped Identity through Professional Associations: A Graduate Student Perspective#FTI#
#IRE#T-shaped identity has been suggested as an effective way to help graduate students develop strong disciplinary expertise and breadth of knowledge. To cultivate this T-shaped identity, graduate students may benefit from participating in professional associations. These professional associations can help graduate students learn and develop through the community's numerous activities such as developing knowledge and skills, presenting and discussing research, learning across the standards, and stepping into leadership roles. This paper discusses three graduate students' viewpoints on their experiences on how engaging in professional organizations has helped shape their identities#FRE#
