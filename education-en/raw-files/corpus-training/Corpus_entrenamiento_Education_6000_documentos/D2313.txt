#ITI#A Monte Carlo Study of Confidence Interval Methods for Generalizability Coefficient#FTI#
#IRE# Computing confidence intervals around generalizability coefficients has long been a challenging task in generalizability theory. This is a serious practical problem because generalizability coefficients are often computed from designs where some facets have small sample sizes, and researchers have little guide regarding the trustworthiness of the coefficients. As generalizability theory can be framed to a linear mixed-effect model (LMM), bootstrap and simulation techniques from LMM paradigm can be used to construct the confidence intervals. The purpose of this research is to examine four different LMM-based methods for computing the confidence intervals that have been proposed and to determine their accuracy under six simulated conditions based on the type of test scores (normal, dichotomous, and polytomous data) and data measurement design (p×i×r and p× [i:r]). A bootstrap technique called “parametric methods with spherical random effects” consistently produced more accurate confidence intervals than the three other LMM-based methods. Furthermore, the selected technique was compared with model-based approach to investigate the performance at the levels of variance components via the second simulation study, where the numbers of examines, raters, and items were varied. We conclude with the recommendation generalizability coefficients, the confidence interval should accompany the point estimate.#FRE#
