#ITI#Teaching Adolescents about Stress Using a Universal School-Based Psychoeducation Program: A Cluster Randomised Controlled Trial#FTI#
#IRE#Psychoeducation programs may increase knowledge about stress and help adolescents cope with stress. However, research about the effectiveness of psychoeducation programs about stress for adolescents is limited. The present study aimed to fill this gap by evaluating the effect of a brief school-based universal psychoeducation program about stress, the Stress Lessons, in terms of knowledge and experienced stress. A total of 1613 adolescents (M = 13.41 years) from Dutch secondary schools participated. A cluster randomised controlled design was employed: classes were randomly assigned to an experimental or control condition. The experimental condition received three Stress Lessons between pre- and post-test. The Stress Lessons provided information about stress, how to recognize stress, and how to cope with and prevent stress. Questionnaires were used to assess knowledge about stress as well as experienced stress. Multilevel analyses were conducted to examine the effectiveness of the Stress Lessons and the moderating effect of gender, educational track, and ethnic background. Results showed that knowledge gain was significantly greater in the experimental than in the control condition. Experienced stress did not change due to the Stress Lessons. Moderator analyses revealed a larger effect of the Stress lessons in terms of knowledge about stress for girls compared to boys and for adolescents who followed academic compared to vocational education. Overall, the findings show that a brief psychoeducation program leads to a better understanding of stress. Therefore, it may be useful for schools to implement such programs to enhance adolescents’ awareness. © The Author(s) 2024.#FRE#
