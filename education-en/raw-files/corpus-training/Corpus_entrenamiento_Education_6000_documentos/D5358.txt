#ITI#Using a video diary in teacher training first-school practice#FTI#
#IRE#In teacher training, it is important to support prospective teachers as they become reflective practitioners. The aim of the study was to discover what, in the opinion of student teachers, are the advantages and disadvantages of using a video diary for learning purposes compared to a written diary. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 34 student teachers, which was then analyzed using qualitative content analysis. In the opinion of student teachers, the advantages of the video diary format were authenticity, team-building facilitation, efficiency, novelty, professionalism, and historical value. The disadvantages were related to anxiety, technical issues and digital competence, usage demands for location, text composition, and hesitation regarding possible video circulation#FRE#
