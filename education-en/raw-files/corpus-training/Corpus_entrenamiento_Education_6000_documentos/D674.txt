#ITI#Toward a consensual definition of educational research and development: a Delphi study#FTI#
#IRE# The concept of research and development (R&D) is well established in the industrial, scientific, and technological fields. In the educational field, however, this concept is typically used as a ‘buzz word’ to refer to innovation and entrepreneurship, blurring its essential meaning. This article uses the Delphi method process of consensus-building to identify common characteristics of the concept as seen by a diversified international group of experts, to reach a clear definition of Educational R&D and apply it to research and policymaking. The findings come up with an operational definition, as well as points of contention regarding the potential of R&D in the education field#FRE#
