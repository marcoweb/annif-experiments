#ITI#Transforming education through ICT: Exploring students' study practices in a resource-constrained university setting#FTI#
#IRE# Abstract: East African universities are confronted with new opportunities and challenges in responding to societal demands while also handling a growing number of students. Thus, they face challenges in offering quality education due to limited learning resources; outdated pedagogical approaches and teaching and learning practices; and inadequate skills in information and communication technology (ICT). This study is part of an effort to transform university education towards better responding to these educational challenges by providing insights into the existing traditions, practices and resources. The research is an explorative qualitative investigation of students' study practices, emphasising the role and use of ICT: How do students employ ICT in their study practices and what challenges do they face in doing so? The investigation is based on activity theory and the idea that an activity analytically may be divided into three levels: the overall motive, specific goals and the conditions for achieving these goals. This hierarchical structure inspired the data collection approach. Three workshops were conducted with 11 students from three different programmes: computer science (BSc + MSc), business and development studies (BA) and education (BA + MA). The workshops focused on (1) tools and spaces, (2) tasks and collaboration, and (3) aims and visions, reflecting the activity hierarchy. Data were generated using photovoice, presentations and discussions based on the students' photos. The paper applies thematic analysis to identify some of the main issues within each level of analysis: the importance of access to WiFi and electricity; smartphones as the most frequently used tools by students. Tasks are primarily curriculum directed, and different forms of productive collaboration are used; students are dedicated to pursuing their professional careers, but personal strategies and care for the community also feature in their overall aims and visions. This study shows that transforming education entails more than developing strategies and implementing new tools; it involves creating insights into existing practices and giving voice to all stakeholders, including students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic The pedagogical approach in higher education must change to enhance the employability of university graduates. Implementing change using ICT is rather difficult and requires a systematic and participatory approach. Higher education institutions in the Global South are resource constrained in delivering quality education. What this paper adds An in-depth understanding of the actual conditions of students' study practices. Practical problems, such as access to WiFi, power and other tools, have an organising impact on students' actual study practices and when and where these practices occur. Using activity theory and photovoice to organise and engage students in providing insights into their study practices. Implications for practice and/or policy Transforming education requires a profound understanding of students' study practices. Access to power and WiFi are basic tools, not add-ons—that is, not things which are ‘nice to have’ but ‘must-haves’. The research findings can be used to involve and engage all stakeholders in change processes#FRE#
