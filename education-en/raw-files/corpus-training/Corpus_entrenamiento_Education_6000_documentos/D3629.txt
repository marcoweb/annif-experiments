#ITI#From assistive to inclusive? A systematic review of the uses and effects of technology to support people with pervasive support needs#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Although particular technologies can enhance the quality of life (QoL) of people with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (we use the term pervasive support needs), their objectives and outcomes are understudied. A systematic literature review was therefore conducted to explore this topic. Method: A search of four databases yielded 64 studies. Data were extracted on their general characteristics, methods and sample characteristics as well as the technology types, QoL domains and application within ecological systems. A narrative synthesis was subsequently developed. Results: Most of the studies applied assistive technology (AT) and focused on personal development and self-determination on an individual level. Conclusions: Technology can enhance the QoL of people with pervasive support needs. There are indications that although MT and UD-based technology are used in practice, few studies have examined these technologies. Therefore, there is a knowledge gap regarding the kinds of technology that are used in practice#FRE#
