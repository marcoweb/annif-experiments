#ITI#Competence development in collaborative hybrid learning among health sciences students: A quasi-experimental mixed-method study#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Health sciences education prepares students for social- and healthcare by developing evidence-based nursing, leadership and working life skills, including collaboration. Due to the changes caused by the global pandemic, health sciences education has shifted more to online and hybrid contexts, which can challenge students' competence development. Students' competence development and interaction in collaborative hybrid learning is a little researched area. Objectives: To observe and evaluate health sciences students' competence development in a collaborative hybrid learning context. Methods: This quasi-experimental mixed-method study was implemented by providing educational intervention. First-year Bachelor's degree health sciences students (n = 18) of a Finnish university completed an educational intervention with synchronous online and face-to-face learning. Students' collaborative hybrid learning and interaction were video observed, while self-evaluation of competence development was made with a questionnaire. Results: In the collaborative interactions, the students showed analytical thinking, problem- solving and communication and technology skills. Extensive knowledge of health sciences and ethics skills was not strongly visible in interaction. The students effectively used collaborative work time to perform tasks. Cognitive interaction (monitoring and evaluating learning) was observed in 85% and socio-emotional interaction (expressions of emotions and motivation) in 53% of the data. Related to the students' learning results, the students' ability to communicate and interact with culturally different people improved after the educational intervention. Conclusion: Collaborative learning methods in hybrid learning can create opportunities for students to construct their competence in interaction. Attention should be paid to different areas of competence and the role of socio-emotional interaction#FRE#
