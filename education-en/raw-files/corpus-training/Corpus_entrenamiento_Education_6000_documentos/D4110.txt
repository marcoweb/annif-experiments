#ITI#Podcasting urban geographies: examining the utility of student-generated research podcasts for deep learning and education for sustainable development#FTI#
#IRE#Action-oriented pedagogies are becoming an increasingly popular instructional approach within higher education, encouraging students to learn by doing and to actively participate in the construction of knowledge, forming part of learning-centred and research-centred approaches to teaching and learning thought to assist deep learning. Such pedagogies are also critical for attending to broader societal challenges through education for sustainable development (ESD). Despite pedagogical shifts, assessment methods remain largely centred on more traditional written methods such as exams or essays, even though there is a growing recognition of the diversity of learners within higher education institutions, coupled with recent drives for adoption of universal design principles for learning (UDL). Within this context, this paper reports on the use of audio podcasts for assessment in a final year urban geography module. Reflective statements completed by the students were analysed to examine the utility of learner-generated research-based podcasts for learning and assessment in urban geography, focussing on the depth of learning, creativity, and the development of graduate attributes. Podcasts have received little attention as a tool for teaching, learning and assessment within Geography, yet innovations in assessment can enhance the profile and popularity of Geography in higher education and beyond#FRE#
