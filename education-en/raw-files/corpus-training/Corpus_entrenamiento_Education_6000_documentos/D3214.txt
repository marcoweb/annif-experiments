#ITI#Navigating the Instructional Design Field as an Afro-Latinx Woman: A Feminist Autoethnography#FTI#
#IRE#In this paper, using a feminist autoethnographical approach, I explore personal experiences as an Afro-Latinx woman studying, teaching, and researching in the instructional design and technology (IDT) field. This feminist autoethnography serves to self-reflect on how, as a woman of color, I have navigated the IDT field as a graduate student and faculty member. In order to challenge, oppose, and dissent against the many oppressive behaviors that women of color like me face in academia, I embraced an intersectional feminist approach in my career as a scholar. In this paper, I dissect intersectional feminism and its influence on me and, therefore, influence on my IDT teaching and scholarship#FRE#
