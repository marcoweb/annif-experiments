#ITI#Interventions fostering well-being of schoolteachers: a review of research#FTI#
#IRE#Schoolteachers’ well-being is considered an important factor for the functioning and efficacy of school systems around the globe and as a major driver of school development. Evidence suggests that teacher well-being can benefit from tailor-made intervention programmes. Thus, scientifically tested well-being programmes are of great interest for individual teachers (e.g. from a self-help perspective) as well as for school administrators and policy makers (e.g. to offer systemic support). The present paper provides a review of 29 peer-reviewed research papers that focus on interventions fostering well-being in teachers. The results show that a wide range of interventions and measurement approaches have been used and reported. Critically, few studies have used a rigorous methodological approach. On the basis of the review, it can be concluded that the field is still in its formation phase. Interventions as well as the scientific study of such interventions are quite novel in this context. Therefore, four major recommendations for advancing the scientific study of teacher well-being interventions are proposed, including conceptual advances and developments in the design, dissemination and study of interventions#FRE#
