#ITI#Dispelling Deficit Framing: Investigating Preservice Teacher Beliefs About the Intersections between Literacy Instruction and Culturally Relevant Pedagogy#FTI#
#IRE#Our study explored preservice teacher beliefs about enacting culturally relevant literacy instructions in their future classrooms. We surveyed PSTs from one teacher education programme across three cohorts, with one cohort completing both pre- and post-survey responses. Engaging in constant comparative analysis of PSTs’ beliefs about the intersection of student diversity and literacy instruction revealed perspectives along a continuum between equity and equality. These beliefs were further categorised into five profiles: (1) Colorblind; (2) Other Factors Matter; (3) Deficit-Framed Diversity; (4) Academic Success; and (5) Cultural Competence. Results also suggest a general shift of PST beliefs over the course of the teacher education programme towards more culturally competent stances, pointing to a primary implication that teacher preparation can support collective development towards cultural awareness#FRE#
