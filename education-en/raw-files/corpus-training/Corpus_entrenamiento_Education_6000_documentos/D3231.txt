#ITI#Expanding Theories of Sociopolitical Development: Centering the Intersectional Experiences of Girls of Color in an Informal STEM Program#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, we bring the concepts of sociopolitical development and intersectionality into conversation to examine how girls of color can develop a sense of agency that is grounded in an understanding of how race and gender impact their desired personal and STEM academic trajectories. Using a three-stage intersectional sociopolitical development framework, we analyzed 33 interviews with participants of CompuGirls, a technology program for girls of color. Our findings show that integrating STEM education, intersectional identity exploration, and sociopolitical critique can 1) positively influence girls’ perceived ability to change their STEM educational conditions; and 2) result in a greater understanding of how the intersections of race and gender have influenced their desired personal and academic trajectories#FRE#
