#ITI#The Influence of Systems Thinking on Immersive Learning Design Decisions#FTI#
#IRE#By considering the interconnectedness of various elements, such as curriculum, instruction, assessment, and school organization, systems thinking provides a framework to understand the underlying patterns, feedback loops, and leverage points that shape educational outcomes. Frick's (1993) systems view of restructuring education supports the notion that design decisions should consider the interdependencies among various educational components. The purpose of this systematic review is to explore how existing research that has been conducted on immersive learning environments addresses the seven relationships as described by Frick (1993)#FRE#
