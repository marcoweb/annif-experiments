#ITI#The Family Game to support parents with intellectual disability in managing challenging behaviours: A replication#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Although many parents with intellectual disability (ID) demonstrate good parenting practices, some parents experience difficulties in managing challenging behaviours. One potential solution to this issue involves using The Family Game, a program designed to teach parents with ID how to manage challenging behaviours in their child. Aims: The purpose of our study was to conduct an independent replication of an investigation that had been performed by the developer of the program. Materials & Methods: We used a multiple baseline design to examine the effects of The Family Game on the behaviour of two parents with ID who had a 3-year-old child. Results: Similarly to the original study, our results indicate that The Family Game improved the use of effective parenting strategies during role play, but that these gains failed to generalise to real-life settings. Conclusion: The study further supports the necessity of adding novel strategies to the game to better promote generalisation#FRE#
