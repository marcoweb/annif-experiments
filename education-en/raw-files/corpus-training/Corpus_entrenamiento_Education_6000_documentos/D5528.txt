#ITI#Exploring student perceptions and experiences of different teaching and learning approaches in architectural history education: a comparative case study#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of the current research was to investigate the perceptions and experiences of university students regarding three different teaching and learning approaches constructed as a face-to-face approach, a technology-supported traditional approach, and an e-learning approach. The researchers attempted to report the preliminary findings of student perceptions and experiences from test lectures given during an EU-funded project which utilised new approaches (i.e. a digital interactive tool and an e-learning platform) in architectural history education. Our qualitative comparative case study involved focus-group interviews with 22 students who took part in different groups for the same course over 6 weeks in the 2018–2019 academic year at a large public university in Southeastern Turkey. The same curriculum content was used for each group in the same course divided into three groups. Semi-structured interview forms were used to examine students’ perceptions and experiences about their groups to compare the pros and cons of the approaches and recommendations for the improvement of each approach. Students put great emphasis on teacher guidance, but they demanded alternative ways to enhance their learning. Timeline travel tool was regarded as a useful interactive tool to be used as a companion and supportive material in architectural history courses. It was understood that the timeline travel e-learning platform could be used as a supplementary resource, not necessarily taking over the role of an instructor. The research suggested that a blended learning approach could make more contributions to student learning#FRE#
