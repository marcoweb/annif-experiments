#ITI#The added value of exploring course innovations university-wide: an application of a multifaceted analytical course innovation framework#FTI#
#IRE# In response to challenges emerging in society, universities are searching for ways to innovate their courses through novel institutional educational policies and practices. Those efforts, however, are often not informed by knowledge about course innovation characteristics university-wide, and are often not supported by processes of reflection questioning the ‘who’, ‘how’ and ‘for what’ of course innovations. This study applied the multifaceted analytical Course Innovation Framework (CIF) in order to explore characteristics of a large set of intended course innovations in a higher education institution in the Netherlands. The application of the CIF enabled a descriptive analysis of multiple characteristics of the intended course innovations. This analysis unveiled university-wide course innovation trends, upon which university stakeholders reflected in order to responsibly guide and transform policy and practices. The study findings show how the application of the CIF helps to gather situated knowledge on university-wide innovation trends, and how reflection on these trends empowers stakeholders to deliberate the culture and values of educational innovation they wish to promote within their institution#FRE#
