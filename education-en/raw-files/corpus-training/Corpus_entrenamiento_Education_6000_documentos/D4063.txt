#ITI#Virtualization in CyberGIS instruction: lessons learned constructing a private cloud to support development and delivery of a WebGIS course#FTI#
#IRE#Students in geographic information systems and science (GIS) require significant experience outside of spatial analysis, cartography, and other traditional geographic topics. Computer science knowledge, skills, and practices exist as essential components of GIS practice, but coursework in this area is not universally offered in geography or GIS degrees. To support those interested in developing such courses, this paper describes the design and implementation of a server-focused course in WebGIS at Texas A&M University. We provide an in-depth discussion of the equipment and resources required to build and operate an on-premise CyberGIS server infrastructure suitable for supporting such classes, providing comparisons with an equivalent solution built on Amazon Web Services (AWS). We consider the comparative costs of these systems, including benefits and drawbacks of each. In comparing these deployment options, we outline the technical expertise, monetary investments, operational expenses, and organizational strategies necessary to run server-based CyberGIS courses. Finally, we reflect on assignments and feedback from students and consider their experiences in a course of this nature. This article provides a resource for GIS instructors, academic departments, or other academic units to consider during infrastructure investment, curriculum redesign, the addition of courses in degree plans, or for the development of CyberGIS components#FRE#
