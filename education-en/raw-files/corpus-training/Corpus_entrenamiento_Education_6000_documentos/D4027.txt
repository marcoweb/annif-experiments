#ITI#Development and application of the multi-dimensional integrated geography curricula from the perspective of regional remote sensing#FTI#
#IRE#Geography can improve citizens’ quality of life by improving their understanding of the population, resources, environment and development of geographical areas. The emergence of remote sensing technology provides a convenient method for understanding the regional geographical landscape. It is important to develop a regional geography curriculum for college students that includes modern remote sensing technology to cultivate their geographic literacy and popularize remote sensing technology. To focus on the development of college students’ valuable ability to think critically in spatial terms, this paper introduces methods for observing the spatiotemporal properties (multi-temporal, multi-scale, multi-angle), physical properties (multi-spectral, multi-product), and natural synthetic properties (multi-element, multi-media) of regional geography via multi-dimensional means. Taking the construction of a regional remote sensing geography course as an example, this paper discusses the goals, content structure and teaching management construction. Then, the study discusses plans and anticipations for the development of the course. Geographical observations and the teaching of geography from the multi-dimensional perspective will provide innovative methods and better results in terms of college students’ quality of education in higher education curricula#FRE#
