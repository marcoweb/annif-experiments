#ITI#Factors to consider when designing effective learning: Infusing computational thinking in mathematics to support thinking-doing#FTI#
#IRE# This study examined what factors might have a positive impact on students’ learning outcomes in mathematical understanding and computational thinking skills. Specifically, whether the proposed instructional design combining computational perspectives and an embodied approach in mathematics learning improves (a) mathematics learning, (b) problem-solving skills in programing, and (c) computational thinking. The study used a quantitative quasi-experimental design with 115 second- to fourth-grade students. Findings suggested that embodied activities combined with the practice of taking computational perspectives in solving mathematics problems led to improved knowledge in mathematics, programing concepts, and computational thinking among young learners. This paper also discusses how to make the computational thinking process more concrete and relevant within the context of mathematics to promote computational thinking skills#FRE#
