#ITI#Connections Between Mathematics and Reading Development: Numerical Cognition Mediates Relations Between Foundational Competencies and Later Academic Outcomes#FTI#
#IRE# We examined longitudinal relations between 1st-grade cognitive predictors (early nonverbal reasoning,processing speed, listening comprehension, working memory, calculation skill, word-problemsolving, word-reading fluency, attentive behavior, and numerical cognition) and 2nd-grade academicoutcomes (calculations, word-problem solving, and word reading) in 370 children (Mage = 6.55 years,SDage = 0.33 years at the start of the study) who were identified as at-risk or not-at-risk for mathematicsdisability. Path analysis mediation models revealed that numerical cognition, assessed at an intermediarytimepoint, mediated the effects of processing speed, working memory, calculation skill,word-problem solving, and attentive behavior on all 3 outcomes. Findings indicate that multiple earlydomain-general cognitive abilities are related to later mathematics and reading outcomes and that numericalcognition processes, which may track ease of forming symbol-concept associations, predictlater performance across both academic domains#FRE#
