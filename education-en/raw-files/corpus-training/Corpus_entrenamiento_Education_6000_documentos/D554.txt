#ITI#Schooling Experiences and Educational Outcomes of Latinx Secondary School Students Living at the Intersections of Multiple Social Constructs#FTI#
#IRE# Based on the critical quantitative intersectionality framework, this study examined the relationships between Latinx students’ multiple intersecting social categorizations (i.e., gender, ethnicity, home language, socioeconomic status [SES], immigration status), their diverse schooling experiences, and educational outcomes. This study found that specific ethnic backgrounds for Latinxs were significantly associated with both their schooling experiences and educational outcomes. Latinxs’ SES was a critical factor in creating the intersectional effects associated with other social constructs for schooling experiences and educational outcomes. Living in poverty created greater challenges in experiencing school suspension for Latinos compared with their Latina counterparts.#FRE#
