#ITI#The effects of native versus multicultural classes on teacher self-efficacy: a case study of Turkish instructors#FTI#
#IRE#The globalisation of the world reflected its inevitable effects in language classrooms which unite students from different cultures. In such classrooms, instructors’ sense of self-efficacy is affected by classroom multiculturality. Setting out from the paucity of research on classroom nativity and multiculturality as factors influencing instructor self-efficacy, this descriptive case study offers a comparative presentation of self-efficacy experiences of nine Turkish instructors teaching Turkish in both native and multicultural classes. The data were collected through semi-structured observations, participant notes and open-ended questions and conventional content analysis was adopted to analyse the data. The results pointed at three major areas affecting the participants’ self-efficacy beliefs and experiences: educational issues, interactional issues and cultural issues. The participants noted that native and multicultural classes have their peculiar characteristics affecting their teaching self-efficacy. In line with the results, some suggestions are made#FRE#
