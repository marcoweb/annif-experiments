#ITI#Insight into plurilingual and pluricultural identity in multigenerational homes: a case study of three young adults#FTI#
#IRE#This qualitative study explored the lived experiences that contribute to plurilingualism and pluricultural identity for three young adults. The research focused on the shared stories of the participants in regard to their language, culture, and identity. The timeline for the study was over various segments of the primary participant's life. As a young adult, she explored her plurilingual and pluricultural identity through semistructured interviews and stimulated recall (SR). Data for the other two participants were collected over a three-month period through semistructured interviews. At the conclusion of the interviews, data were analysed through the use of thematic analysis. The themes explored were: family; language; and identity. The study found that positive relationships with family and extended family present in the home was a significant factor in the development of plurilingual and cultural identity for all three participants. Greater linguistic ability did not necessarily lead to greater language confidence, nor greater plurilingual self-identification. While the study allowed for a detailed view into which experiences impacted on the development of plurilingual and pluricultural identification, more attention to plurilingualism is needed in order to further develop the research concerning the topic#FRE#
