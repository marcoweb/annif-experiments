#ITI#Parental Math Input Is Not Uniformly Beneficial for Young Children: The Moderating Role of Inhibitory Control#FTI#
#IRE# Recent work has stressed the importance of considering child-level propensities and environmental opportunities when studying early math achievement; however, few studies investigate the interaction between these factors. This study examined whether children’s inhibitory control moderates the association between parental math input and children’s math performance. Parental math input via number talk and parent-reported frequencies of math activities were measured in 123 children (Mage = 3.9 years) and one of their parents. High levels of parent number talk were associated with higher math achievement among children with higher inhibitory control. This association was not seen in children with lower inhibitory control, for children’s vocabulary as the outcome measure, or for parents’ overall talk or parent-reported math activities as the opportunity measures. Thus, children may differentially benefit from parental math input depending on their cognitive abilities and this association is specific to parental number talk and children’s math abilities#FRE#
