#ITI#Teacher self-efficacy and reform: a systematic literature review#FTI#
#IRE#Teacher self-efficacy (TSE) of pre-service and in-service teachers plays a significant role in the successful implementation of educational reforms. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to explore the interaction between curriculum and/or assessment reform and TSE. Twenty-nine empirical research studies are analysed to find factors that impact TSE during change and the support mechanisms necessary to maintain high TSE. Using the Systematic Quantitative Literature Review method coupled with Social Cognitive Theory and Sources of Self-efficacy, studies reported that environmental determinants lower TSE during reform. It was found that to support high TSE professional learning was a necessity#FRE#
