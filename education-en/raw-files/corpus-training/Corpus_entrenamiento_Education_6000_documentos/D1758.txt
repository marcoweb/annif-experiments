#ITI#Examining virtual reality as a platform for developing mental models of industrial systems#FTI#
#IRE# Industrial systems can be complex and not intuitive to perceive. Therefore, students in technology and engineering programs can benefit from developing mental models of industrial systems during their journey in college. However, more often than not, these students do not have access to industrial facilities; thus, developing mental models for systems is a challenge. This paper examines the merit of an Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) framework application in creating proper mental models for industrial systems in technology and engineering students. Two IVR applications were developed. One IVR application afforded interaction with components of a prefabricated industrial cooling water system (CWVR). In the other application, students designed and built industrial systems with IVR (system designer VR [SDVR]). SDVR facilitated constructive-generative engagement. A group of 33 students was divided into two; one group (the Design, experimental group) was tasked with building a system with SDVR and interacting with the cooling water system in CWVR. The other group was tasked with directly interacting with the CWVR without building a system with SDVR (the Interaction, comparison group). Students' mental models of the cooling water system in CWVR were evaluated following completing the interaction experience with CWVR. The results demonstrate that the causal model notion of the mental model of the cooling water system was significantly higher in the Design, experimental group. The results suggest that designing a rich IVR application that facilitates constructive-generative engagements may carry merit in informing student mental models of complex technical concepts#FRE#
