#ITI#Does public consultation affect policy formulation? Negotiation strategies between the administration and citizens#FTI#
#IRE# While public consultation is a signature process of democratic policy formulation, many governments manoeuvre to refract citizen’s opinions or conduct it perfunctorily. Using the case of a medium of instruction policy in Hong Kong, this article unveils the strategies that the state and citizens employ to put their opinion through to the final policy text, during a public consultation process. Recent literature has identified the mechanisms through which individual actors or organisations contribute to broad policy agenda-setting or policy programme development. However, yet to be investigated is how they–sometimes with conflicting interests–collectively negotiate a policy with the state via public consultations. This paper investigates this very phenomenon, building on previous work conducted in the public policy field, analysing 51 government-generated documents through both thematic content analysis and critical discourse analysis. The paper uncovers four strategies adopted by administrations (non-commitment, case closure, disengagement for irrelevance, and placation) to evade citizens’ equity-oriented demands and stakeholders’ three counter strategies (mobilising other stakeholders into a coalition, reopening the case pointing out a new problem, and appealing by affirming relevance). The state’s discrete refusals and stakeholders’ conjoint reengagement tactics draw our attention to the complexity and subtlety involved in negotiation via public consultations#FRE#
