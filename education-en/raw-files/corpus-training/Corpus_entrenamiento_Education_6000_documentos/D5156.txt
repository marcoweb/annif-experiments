#ITI#Language revitalization through Indigenous Mexican hip hop: building towards an Indigenous hip hop futurism#FTI#
#IRE#This article demonstrates how language revitalization through Indigenous Mexican hip hop can continue to Indigenize decolonial pedagogical spaces, help strengthen Black/Indigenous solidarity, and aid in building the infrastructures for Indigenous futures. First, I assert that using and transmitting Indigenous languages through hip hop can challenge Eurocentric pedagogy by engaging in decolonial and public pedagogies. Drawing on Jennifer Wemigwans’ theorization around ‘digital bundles,’ I define Indigenous YouTube videos as a distinctly Indigenous space to disseminate knowledge. Then, I argue that Indigenous language use in hip hop strengthens Black/Indigenous solidarity by engaging T. Roberts’ discussion on modes of appropriation and Beverley Diamond’s ‘Alliance Studies.’ Focusing on the commonalities between oral traditions, Indigenous language hip hop uses technology and citational practices to mediate between tradition and modernity. Finally, I contend hip hop language revitalization builds the infrastructure for Indigenous futures. Expanding on Indigenous modernity scholarship, I propose an Indigenous hip hop futurism that might allow us to think of other Indigenous issues, not just the need for language revitalization, through the lens of hip hop#FRE#
