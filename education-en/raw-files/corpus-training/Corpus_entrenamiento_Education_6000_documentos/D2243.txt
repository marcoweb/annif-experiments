#ITI#Examining Multidimensional Measuring Instruments for Proximity to Unidimensional Structure Using Latent Variable Modeling#FTI#
#IRE# A widely applicable procedure of examining proximity to unidimensionality for multicomponent measuring instruments with multidimensional structure is discussed. The method is developed within the framework of latent variable modeling and allows one to point and interval estimate an explained variance proportion-based index that may be considered a measure of proximity to unidimensional structure. The approach is readily utilized in educational, behavioral, and social research when it is of interest to evaluate whether a more general structure scale, test, or measuring instrument could be treated as being associated with an approximately unidimensional latent structure for some empirical purposes.#FRE#
