#ITI#Relationship between touchscreen tablet usage time and attention performance in young children#FTI#
#IRE# This study aims to investigate the relationships between touchscreen tablet usage time and attention performance in preschool children. Seventy-five young children with typical development were recruited. The accuracy rate and reaction time of their attention performance improved with age. Significant differences in accuracy rates, reaction time, and executive attention performance between young children who use touchscreen tablets more or less often were observed. Children who spent more time using touchscreen tablets had better accuracy rates and faster reaction time in the Attentional Network Task test. However, children who spent more time on tablets performed slower in terms of executive attention. These findings add to the understanding of the experience of using touchscreen tablets and its relationship with the attention performance of young children#FRE#
