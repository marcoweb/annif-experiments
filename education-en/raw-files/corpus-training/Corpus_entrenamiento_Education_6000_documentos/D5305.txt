#ITI#Increased Metacognition About Health and Learning in a Middle School-based Health Promotion Project Using an Action-oriented Research Model#FTI#
#IRE#Health is a resource for pupils’ learning. Including health in the curriculum and teaching will enable pupils to understand the connection between health and learning. Action research has proved to be effective from a learning perspective. Our purpose was to explore whether, and how, using action-oriented research methods in a middle school-based health promotion project contributed to metacognition about health and learning. The design was an action-oriented research model using reflection forums: a support group; a project group; and two focus groups of pupils and teachers. The latent content analysis resulted in three categories: (1) Professional aspects; (2) Educational aspects; and (3) Structural aspects, with adherent subcategories. The discussion presents a synthesis of findings about metacognition, with Structural factors and processes and Personal factors and processes. In conclusion, this article presents how action-oriented research methods, using reflection forums, can contribute to participants’ metacognition about health and learning#FRE#
