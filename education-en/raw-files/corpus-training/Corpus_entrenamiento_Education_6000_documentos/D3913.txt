#ITI#From pre-service science teacher towards transformative intellectual: pre-service science teachers address food insecurity in South Africa#FTI#
#IRE#Teacher training requires teachers to learn not only the academic content they must teach but to learn how to teach. In the modern world where changes are constant and the teaching demands are many, pre-service teachers must learn skills but they must also learn certain attitudes and beliefs that will allow them to be successful and effective in their profession. This study investigated the changes reported by pre-service science teachers after they completed a food gardening project as part of their teacher training. Qualitative data were collected through the use of focused group interviews, individual interviews, and written journal entries. Data were analysed using a critical pedagogy theoretical framework. Teachers reported significant changes in their attitudes and beliefs after their gardening experiences. They reflected on their new-found understanding that they could change the way they teach and that their teaching could have an effect on their students and their communities#FRE#
