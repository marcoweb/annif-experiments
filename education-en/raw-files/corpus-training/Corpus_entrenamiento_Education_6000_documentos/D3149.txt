#ITI#Women as Top-Producing Authors, Editors, and Editorial Board Members in Educational Psychology Journals from 2017 to 2021#FTI#
#IRE# The claim that women have been underrepresented as authors, editorial board members (EBMs), and editors in educational psychology journals relevant to organizational membership was first made 25 years ago (Robinson et al., 1998). Since then, follow-up studies have found that women have made gains in each of these areas but still lag behind membership trends as authors and EBMs (Evans et al., 2005; Fong et al., 2009; Greenbaum et al., 2018). The present study extended this research to 2021 while also identifying top women authors. Women’s representation (1) as authors has slowly increased but has not kept pace with membership trends, (2) as EBMs has not increased significantly since 1996, and (3) as editors has fallen below membership trends in 2021. With regard to top-producing women authors, Tamara van Gog and Patricia Alexander led in terms of article counts and points, respectively. Compared to men, there were four women among the top 10 researchers in terms of article points, but only one woman among the top 10 researchers in terms of article counts#FRE#
