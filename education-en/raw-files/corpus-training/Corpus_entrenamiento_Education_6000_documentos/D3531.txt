#ITI#Using the learning disability screening questionnaire to help identify people with an intellectual disability in homeless services#FTI#
#IRE#Background: We explored the accuracy of using the learning disability screening questionnaire (LDSQ) in services for people experiencing homelessness in the United Kingdom. Method: We examined the concordance between the LDSQ outcomes and assessments of intellectual disability. Seventy adults experiencing homelessness completed the LDSQ. Staff completed the LDSQ and a measure of adaptive functioning for 38 of this group. Nine participants received an intellectual assessment. Results: Sensitivity and specificity for the LDSQ when completed by staff was 83% and 96% respectively and 50% and 92% when completed by the individual. Seven people had intellectual and adaptive functioning in the intellectual disability range. Conclusion: The results suggest that the LDSQ would be an appropriate and beneficial screening tool to use within services for people experiencing homelessness. More accurate results would be likely if it were completed by staff#FRE#
