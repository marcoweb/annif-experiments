#ITI#Online higher education: current landscape and future trends#FTI#
#IRE#This critical review and perspective of the literature features the current landscape of online learning in higher education institutions (HEIs). The review starts by exploring the changing nature of student needs and staff and institutional roles in the face of online learning, and how digital transformation is shaping the culture and ways of learning. The aim is to better understand the challenges faced by higher education leaders to adopt online offerings and the factors affecting their decision-making. Emergence and fast evolution of third-party online programme management providers (OPMs) and forces which encourage or oppose their partnership with HEIs are critically discussed. The review also highlights the impact of COVID-19 emergency online learning on institutional practices and future adoption of online offerings#FRE#
