#ITI#New Juan Crow Education as a Context for Institutional Microaggressions: Latina/o/x Students Maintaining College Aspirations#FTI#
#IRE# Latina/o/x students aspire to earn a college degree but given that they likely attend urban high schools with inadequate educational opportunities and high-discipline environments, more research is needed to examine the influence of institutional racism on aspirations. This case study was guided by the frameworks of New Juan Crow in Education and racial microaggressions. Using ethnographic data from observations, semi-structured interviews with educators, and oral history interviews with Latina/o/x students, this study examined the experiences of student participants with institutional microaggressions and the influence on college-going aspirations. Implications address the cumulative effects of microaggressions and inform asset-based research, policies, and practices.#FRE#
