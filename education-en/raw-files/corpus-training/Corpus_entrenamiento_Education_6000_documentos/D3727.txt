#ITI#Mental distress among Indonesian academic mothers during enforced remote working#FTI#
#IRE#Working from home as a preventive measure against the spread of COVID-19 has extensively impacted the mental health of academics worldwide. Interviewing 73 Indonesian academics who are also mothers, the current article investigates key impacts of mental distress among them during enforced remote working in the country, and how they encountered sociocultural stressors at home. This study found that the primary triggers for their mental distress included a problematic transition from office-based to home-based work, feelings of helplessness at home, and the use of multiple learning technologies at home. This paper discusses recommendations to aid problem-solving in this area#FRE#
