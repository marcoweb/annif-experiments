#ITI#The Susceptibility of Teaching to White Interests: A Theoretical Explanation of the Influence of Racial Consciousness on the Behaviors of White Faculty in the Classroom#FTI#
#IRE#This article presents the White racial consciousness and faculty behavior (WRC/FB) model, which emerged from a constructivist grounded theory study I conducted. The WRC/FB model represents the inextricable link between racial consciousness and White faculty behaviors that either challenge or serve White interests and, consequently, White supremacy. This research broadens the higher education literature on teaching and learning by using Kimberlé Crenshaw’s restrictive and expansive views of equality framework and Derrick Bell’s interest convergence principle to establish a connection between advancing racial justice and excellence in college teaching#FRE#
