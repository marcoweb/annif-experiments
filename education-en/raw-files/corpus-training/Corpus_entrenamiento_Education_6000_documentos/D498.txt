#ITI#Engaging with literacies of resistance#FTI#
#IRE# We explore discourses about social emotional learning (SEL) and trauma-informed practices (TIP) as school interventions in response to resistance from students and guardians. We analyze an illustrative example and one data source that casts light on the deficit impact of SEL and TIP discourses on both teacher/school practices and children and guardian experiences in navigating such discourses. Resistance is explored and ultimately defended in the context of the interventions being enacted upon the children/youth and as a literacy of survivance for children/youth with traumatized histories, along with the guardians who advocate for and shield them from such interventions#FRE#
