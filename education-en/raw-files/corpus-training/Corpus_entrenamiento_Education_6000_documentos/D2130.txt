#ITI#The educational value of internet use in the home for school children: A systematic review of literature#FTI#
#IRE# This article presents a systematic review of literature that explores the educational value of the Internet in the home for school aged children. Research published between 2008 and 2018 was examined and 67 items were analyzed. A range of positive, negative and neutral correlations or outcomes of home Internet use were identified across the three functions of education; academic achievement and skills, developing the individual and socialization. Overall, there were significantly more positive correlations or outcomes reported. We conclude that there is educational value in home Internet use and the value is influenced by the nature of online activities#FRE#
