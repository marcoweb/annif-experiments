#ITI#Effects of providing EFL learners with additional online and face-to-face practise opportunities to promote active learning in higher education#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Limited research on the effectiveness of additional online and face-to-face practise opportunities for promoting active learning among Chinese EFL learners in higher education. Current understanding of self-regulated and collaborative learning theories in educational contexts. Objectives: To establish the efficacy of interactive online and face-to-face practise opportunities for enhancing active learning among Chinese EFL learners. Methods: Employed mixed methods research to assess the impact of different types of practise opportunities on 116 EFL learners. Utilised methodological triangulation of QUAN + QUAL data and one-way ANOVA for interpretation. Results and conclusions: The study demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating online and face-to-face practise opportunities to enhance active learning. Empirical evidence supports the pedagogical and theoretical benefits of these opportunities for promoting active learning among EFL learners#FRE#
