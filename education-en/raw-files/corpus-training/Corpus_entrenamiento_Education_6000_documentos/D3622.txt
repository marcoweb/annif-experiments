#ITI#Increasing physical activity through an adapted web-based exercise program for people with intellectual disabilities: Support staff are crucial for feasibility#FTI#
#IRE#Background: People with intellectual disabilities are less physically active and suffer from ill-health more than the general population. Support staff play an important role in the person's life. This study aimed to explore the support staff's experiences regarding the feasibility of adapted web-based exercise for people with intellectual disabilities. Method: Participants with intellectual disabilities living in community-based settings were recruited for a web-based exercise study. Eight semi-structured interviews were carried out with their support staff before and after the intervention period. Results: The main theme, ‘Support staff are crucial for feasibility’ encompasses the importance of communication, structure, and motivation in improving physical activity for people with intellectual disabilities. Conclusion: The experiences of support staff, indicate that a web-based exercise program is feasible for the target group, and one way to overcome challenges for PA, where the role of the staff is crucial#FRE#
