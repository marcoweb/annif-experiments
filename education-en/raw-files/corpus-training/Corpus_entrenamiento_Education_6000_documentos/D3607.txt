#ITI#Israeli social workers' recommendations on residential settings for individuals with intellectual disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Background: People with intellectual disabilities have the right to live in the community. As social workers have an important role in decisions regarding residential settings, this study examined their recommendations regarding residential living arrangements of individuals with intellectual disabilities. Method: Using a factorial survey approach 174 social workers were presented with true-to-life vignettes and asked to provide their recommendations regarding housing in community apartments, hostels (large group homes) and meonot (large institutions). Results: Higher likelihood of recommending housing in a community apartment was associated with mild intellectual disability, lack of daily support needs, no sexual abuse history, and stated preference for a community apartment. Social workers' experience in working in a specific residential setting was associated with recommending it. Conclusions: Ongoing training on rights-based ethics and the importance of community inclusion should be provided to social workers. Further, community alternatives should be made available to all individuals with disabilities#FRE#
