#ITI#Breaking the silence: working with pupil voice in Iranian primary schools#FTI#
#IRE# The paper provides analysis of findings from research on “pupil voice” collected from 88 Iranian pupils within five primary classrooms. No previous research has been carried out in Iran on “pupil voice” emphasising children’s right to a say about different matters in their school lives. Two methods of data collection were applied: a) participant observation where the observer facilitated workshops within each classroom enabling children to reflect on issues that matter to them; b) individual interviews with pupils, teachers and headteachers aimed at gathering information regarding school participants’ insights into their experiences in schools, including the role of teachers, school regulations and pupil voice activities. Our data reports on the preoccupation teachers and children had with our workshop as an alternative pedagogic form in their schools. While both pupils and teachers saw the advantages of a participatory approach to classroom interactions, national, educational and pedagogic cultural factors provided substantial challenges#FRE#
