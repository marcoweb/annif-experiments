#ITI#Examining the relationships among self-regulated learning, homework timeliness, and course achievement: a context of female students learning quantitative topics#FTI#
#IRE# Homework completion is associated with learning achievement, but students’ challenges revolve around meeting deadlines and preventing procrastination. Promoting students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) can overcome these challenges. We explored the role of SRL (forethought and learning strategies) on the timeliness of homework submissions performed by undergraduate female students in quantitative courses. Data were collected from a survey and Learning Management System log. A structural equation modeling analysis indicated that the forethought components had a direct effect on the learning strategies. The use of learning strategies significantly influenced homework timeliness, which then significantly affected course achievement. Discussion regarding mixed results and strategies for scaffolding SRL through homework assignments are included. A suggestion on guiding students to execute suitable learning strategies for mastering quantitative topics is presented#FRE#
