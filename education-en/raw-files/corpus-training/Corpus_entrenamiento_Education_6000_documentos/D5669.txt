#ITI#Memories and self-efficacy among adults with attention deficit disorder symptoms#FTI#
#IRE#Research has already demonstrated the impact of positive and negative social interactions on one’s self-efficacy. In particular, empowering or degrading messages from school teachers may have a significant long-term effect on students’ self- efficacy. This is especially pertinent to students with ADHD symptoms, since they face increased challenges during childhood in school environment. The goals of the present study are to examine the relationships between memories of adults with ADHD and their social support and self-efficacy. 319 participants (253 (79.3%) females) reported their positive and negative memories of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ teachers, as well as current levels of perceived social support, ADHD symptoms’ severity and self-efficacy. Results indicated a serial mediation model, in which the positive and negative memories, family support and peer support mediated the relations between ADHD symptoms and self-efficacy. In addition, ADHD symptoms predicted fewer positive memories, and more negative memories, and social support mediated their relations with self-efficacy#FRE#
