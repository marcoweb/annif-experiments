#ITI#Diversity, exclusion and inclusion: a case study of welcome online & minority language representation in MOOCs#FTI#
#IRE#Learning a language has become more accessible online butrelatively-few applied studies have explored the implications of technological advances, and the learners who use them (Chik and Ho 2017. “Learn a Language for Free: Recreational Learning among Adults.” System 69: 162–171, 163). This mixed-methods study explores participation, exclusion and inclusion, in an Irish language MOOC, where participation reflects intrinsic learning (Deci and Ryan 1985. Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination in Human Behavior. New York: Plenum), and cultural-oriented motivations (Van Duesen-Scholl 2003. “Towards a Definition of Heritage Language: Sociopolitical and Pedagogical Considerations.” Journal of Language, Identity and Education 2 (3): 211–230). Using survey data (n = 1,523) and open-ended comments, learners' participation is conceptualised by exploring their demographic backgrounds. Tensions are demonstrated between the types of learning and motives of course participants, the metrics by which many online courses are viewed as successful, and the real value of learning a language for cultural, humanistic and intrinsic purposes (see Ushioda 2017. “The Impact of Global English on Motivation to Learn Other Languages: Towards an Ideal Multilingual Self.” The Modern Language Journal 101 (3): 469–482). The case also explores issues of both exclusion, and inclusion, in distance language learning more generally#FRE#
