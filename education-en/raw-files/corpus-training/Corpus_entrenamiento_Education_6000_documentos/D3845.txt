#ITI#Number Sense Across the Transition from Preschool to Elementary School: A Latent Profile Analysis#FTI#
#IRE#Empirical research on number sense to date has been conducted with preschoolers and elementary school students. Despite their contributions to the literature, these studies have used variable-centered analytic approaches that may prevent distinct number sense profiles for preschoolers and first graders from being identified. This study aimed to determine the number and proportions of distinct number sense profiles, the variables influencing these profiles, and the characteristics of the children with different profiles in the transition from preschool to elementary school. We conducted a quantitative study using a cross-sectional design for this purpose and used latent profile analysis to identify and describe distinct number sense profiles for preschoolers and first-grade students. A total of 1688 children, 848 from preschool and 840 from the first grade of elementary school, took part in the study. A Number Sense Screener was used to determine number sense profiles. The data collection tool used in the study was found to be reliable. Based on the findings of the study, we identified three profiles for both the preschoolers and first graders, namely, moderate very low, moderate low, and moderate high. We examined family and household income variables to help predict the profiles. We then took the characteristics and components of number sense that caused the differentiation in the profiles as revealed by the results of the study and discussed them in light of the literature. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
