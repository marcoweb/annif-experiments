#ITI#Creative Dialogue with Generative AI: Exploring the Possible with Ron Beghetto#FTI#
#IRE#In this article, we explore the intersection of creativity, education, and technology, with a focus on the impact of Generative AI (GenAI). We delve into the transformative potential of GenAI in redefining educational and creative processes and challenging our existing notions of learning and creativity. Through a conversation with renowned creativity researcher Dr. Ronald Beghetto, we thematically explore how GenAI redefines educational and creative processes and challenges conventional notions of learning and creativity. Dr. Beghetto’s work highlights a shift from fearing failure to embracing possibility thinking, advocating for a mindset that views creativity as a dynamic interplay of potential and adaptability. His recent work with GenAI tools illustrates their role as catalysts for possibility thinking, pushing the boundaries towards future-oriented thought and innovation. GenAI can function in multiple ways—including as a reflection of human intellect and values, and as a collaborative partner that enriches human creativity with its unpredictability and generative capabilities. We emphasize the importance of direct, critical, and creative engagement with GenAI in educational settings, cautioning against its passive or uncritical use, and advocating for a balanced approach that leverages its strengths while remaining aware of its limitations. Sharing several possibility thinking tools he has created, Dr. Beghetto offers readers a nuanced perspective on the role of GenAI in education and creativity, advocating for a future where these tools are used responsibly and creatively to unlock new possibilities and enhance human potential. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2024.#FRE#
