#ITI#Retrieval-Based Learning and Prior Knowledge#FTI#
#IRE# Retrieval practice typically benefits later memory more than restudy (i.e., the testing effect). The benefits of retrieval-based learning generalize across a range of materials and contexts, leading many cognitive scientists to advocate for broad educational implementation. However, educators and practitioners call for more research on factors critical to education (e.g., individual differences between learners). One key understudied factor is the amount of relevant prior knowledge held by the learner, which can moderate the effectiveness of other learning strategies (i.e., expertise-reversal effects). The current study investigated the potential moderating influence of prior knowledge on the learning benefits of retrieval. To assess the causal effects of prior knowledge on later learning strategy effectiveness, we randomly assigned online participants to be trained in multiple topics within one of two academic domains over 3 days. Participants then engaged in a more typical testing effect paradigm—they studied new scientific text passages related to their trained or untrained domain and completed two rounds of focused restudy or retrieval with elaborative feedback (repeated for the other domain). Two days later, participants took a final test on the previously learned information from both domains. Despite being rated as more effortful than restudy, retrieval practice led to greater overall test performance (with larger relative benefits on retention than transfer questions). Critically, despite a substantial benefit from training-induced knowledge, testing effects were nearly identical for high and low prior knowledge information. This suggests that prior knowledge is not a critical boundary condition of retrieval-based learning#FRE#
