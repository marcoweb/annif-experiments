#ITI#The Impact of Culturally Inclusive Pedagogy on Student Achievement in a Multicultural Urban School Setting#FTI#
#IRE# In response to a critical need for culturally inclusive pedagogy for multicultural, urban classrooms, this study describes a project in which 43 in-service and preservice teachers and 175 multicultural urban public school students participated. This study found that the culturally relevant pedagogy significantly enhanced the student attitude toward math and science. The pedagogy also improved student achievement in math and science. In addition, parents or guardians were reported to be a primary human resource for academic support. These findings call for the transformation of teacher education programs and further research on other educational resources for multicultural urban classrooms.#FRE#
