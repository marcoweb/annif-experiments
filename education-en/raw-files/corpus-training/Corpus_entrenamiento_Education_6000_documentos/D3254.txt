#ITI#Maker-Centered Professional Learning for Inservice and Preservice K-12 Educators: A Systematic Literature Review#FTI#
#IRE#The shift from traditional education to maker-centered learning calls for an analysis and evaluation of the current studies on professional development in maker-centered learning. The current systematic literature review was conducted to examine existing literature on teacher professional development for maker-centered learning. It aligns the literature to the theory of constructionism, which is often cited as a foundational theory supporting maker-centered learning. The creation and integration of makerspaces in educational environments is a growing trend that supports creating and building material objects for learning. As makerspaces emerge in K-12 contexts, the need for research-based teacher education practices becomes apparent. The findings of this literature review describe the current landscape of research on this topic, illustrating the types of research conducted, the goals of professional development for teachers in this area, and effective elements of professional development experiences that contribute to teacher success in using maker-centered learning strategies. The implications of the findings and suggestions for future research are presented#FRE#
