#ITI#How does training format and clinical education model impact fidelity and confidence in a speech-language pathology rotation?#FTI#
#IRE# Clinical education rotations typically involve an initial training phase followed by supervised clinical practice. However, little research has explored the separate contributions of each component to the development of student confidence and treatment fidelity. The dual purpose of this study was to compare the impact of clinical training format (synchronous vs. asynchronous) and education model (traditional vs. collaborative) on student confidence and treatment fidelity. Thirty-six speech-language pathology graduate students completed this two-phase study during a one-term clinical rotation. Phase 1 investigated the impact of training condition (synchronous, asynchronous guided, asynchronous unguided) on student confidence and treatment fidelity. Phase 2 explored the impact of education model (traditional vs. collaborative) on student confidence and treatment fidelity. Treatment fidelity was measured at the conclusion of Phases 1 and 2. Students rated their confidence at six-time points throughout the study. Our results indicate that training condition did not differentially impact student confidence or treatment fidelity; however, education model did: students in the collaborative education model reported increased confidence compared to students in the traditional education model. Students in the collaborative education model also trended towards having higher treatment fidelity than students in the traditional education model. These results demonstrate that pre-clinical trainings can be effective in several different formats provided they cover the discrete skills needed for the clinical rotation. While preliminary, our results further suggest that students may benefit from working with peers during their clinical rotations.#FRE#
