#ITI#Gender bias and gender equality beliefs in teaching efficacy profiles of Finnish physical education teachers#FTI#
#IRE#Homogeneous teaching efficacy profiles of in-service physical education (PE) teachers (N = 175) from a variety of educational institutions, elementary to higher education, were examined. In addition, associated gender bias and equality beliefs in PE were investigated. Three profiles (Low, Intermediate, High) were identified using cross-sectional data collected via an anonymous online survey. The PE teachers with the highest teaching efficacy reported the highest higher gender equality beliefs. In the low efficacy profile, females and PE teachers with a master’s degree scored higher on gender equality beliefs than males or teachers with other tertiary education, and longer compared to shorter teaching experience was associated with higher gender bias. In the intermediate and high teaching efficacy profiles, males reported higher gender bias beliefs than females, whereas longer service was associated with lower gender equality beliefs only in the high teaching efficacy profile. Teacher education may be the most effective channel to tackle gender bias beliefs in PE classes, which should be free from all types of discrimination#FRE#
