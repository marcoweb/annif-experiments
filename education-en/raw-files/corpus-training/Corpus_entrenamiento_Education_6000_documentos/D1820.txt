#ITI#The effects of video-driven discussions integrated into the flipped classroom model on learning achievement, practical performance, and higher-order thinking skills in dental education#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Flipped classroom (FC) model has become increasingly popular in dental education (DE) with its strengths for students. However, major concerns are lack of interaction, unwillingness to complete the assignments, low engagement during the pre-class activities because of an unwell-designed instructional setting of FC. Objectives: The recent study aims to investigate the effects of video-driven discussions integrated into the flipped classroom (VdDs-FC) model on dental students' (DSs) learning achievement, practical performance, and higher-order thinking skills in a restorative dentistry course. Methods: This study adopted a sequential explanatory design from mixed-methods research. A total of 96 DSs participated in a dentistry faculty of TÃ¼rkiye. They were randomly divided into two groups: VdDs-FC group and the conventional flipped classroom (c-FC) group. Results and conclusions: The results showed that the VdDs-FC model had significant positive effects on the practical performance of DSs in practical subjects and their problem-solving and critical thinking skills. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in learning achievement and creativity. The use of FC in the c-FC group did not lead to any difference in the students' achievements. Moreover, the qualitative results indicated that the VdDs-FC model has the potential for enhancing peer learning, practical classroom activities, and higher-order thinking skills. Implications: This study also includes several instructional implications and suggestions for educators, researchers, and practitioners on use of FC in dentistry#FRE#
