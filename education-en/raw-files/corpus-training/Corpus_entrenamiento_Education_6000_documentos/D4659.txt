#ITI#Developing and investigating an electronic performance support system (EPSS) for academic performance#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this study was to develop an electronic performance support system (EPSS) to improve students’ performance in the topic of scientific research methods. A review of the literature shows that EPSSs are usually developed using advanced programming technologies. This limits the widespread use of EPSS for educators and researchers. In this study, a mid-level EPSS was developed by integrating Moodle to a static (non-interactive) educational system, without using advanced programming. The study was designed and carried out using the developmental research method. Study participants were second year students from the Faculty of Medicine of Hacettepe University in Turkey. The system was designed by taking students’ needs into account, as well as other issues that the literature identified as points of consideration when developing an EPSS. The mid-level EPSS developed within the framework of this study increased the students’ academic achievement and students stated that the system met their expectations.Implications for practice or policy:• Educators can support scientific research methods courses with EPSSs.• Educators and researchers may take advantage of detailed steps in this research, if they want to develop such an EPSS.• A mid-level EPSS is taken as reference when developing an EPSS without advanced programming skills © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
