#ITI#TVET model for building safety and sustainable agriculture in Iran by 2030 and beyond#FTI#
#IRE#Agricultural technical and vocational education and training (TVET) for sustainable development is too important to be implemented with no plan and accomplish tangible results in the real world or in the agricultural setting. TVET can be fruitful if it is performed systematically based on proper criteria, competencies, and educational methods. This research aimed to determine the proper criteria, competencies, and educational methods for agricultural TVET for sustainable development using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), Delphi technique, and content analysis of the literature by the PRISMA method in Iran. The results showed that agricultural TVET for sustainable development could be identified within five criteria. A total of 15 competencies were identified as the competencies of agricultural TVET for sustainable development. These competencies should be developed among trainees to achieve sustainable agriculture goals. They can be broadly classified into three categories–learning to know, learning to do, and learning to live together. The competencies in the categories of learning to do and learning to live together had higher weights in achieving sustainable agriculture goals. Finally, four educational methods were identified for training these competencies and their relative weights were determined#FRE#
