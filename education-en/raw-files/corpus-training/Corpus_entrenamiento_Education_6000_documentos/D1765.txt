#ITI#Facilitating learning in immersive virtual reality: Segmentation, summarizing, both or none?#FTI#
#IRE# Introduction: This study investigates the effectiveness of the segmentation principle from the cognitive theory of multimedia learning as well as the effectiveness of the generative learning strategy of summarization in immersive virtual reality (IVR) within a sample of preadolescents. Although previous research has supported the effectiveness of these instructional methods in multimedia learning, it remains unclear whether segmentation, summarization or the combination of both are superior to a stand-alone IVR lesson in facilitating learning. Methods: To address this gap, 190 sixth to seventh grade students learned about the human body in an IVR lesson. Students were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions: (a) an IVR lesson divided into four segments (segmentation condition); (b) an IVR lesson, where students summarized after the entire lesson (summarizing condition); (c) an IVR lesson presented in four segments, where students summarized after each segment (combined condition); and (d) an IVR lesson without any manipulation (control condition). Results: Results indicated that, compared to the control condition, adding segmentation or summarization to an IVR lesson leads to better transfer, but not to acquiring more factual knowledge. Combining the two methods did not improve learning. Conclusion: The findings support the evidence that choosing appropriate instructional methods for IVR lessons can foster transfer#FRE#
