#ITI#Insights on information literacy from social studies classrooms in the southeast#FTI#
#IRE# Living and learning in the United States in 2023 is different than it was decades ago. The proliferation of mis/disinformation vis-a-vis digital means is causing “truth decay,” with an increase in disagreement amongst citizens about what is opinion and fact. Such disagreements constrain opportunities for healthy democratic dialogue. To repair and rebuild dialogue, citizens need information literacy. This article draws upon qualitative data from four social studies eleventh grade classrooms, including teacher and student interviews and focus groups, to better understand the contemporary landscape of teaching and learning information literacy in today’s digital age. Analysis of findings speak to five interrelated insights from practice within the information literacy teaching and learning landscape of one high school context in the southeast of the United States#FRE#
