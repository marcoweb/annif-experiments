#ITI#Inclusion of students with special education needs in Nordic countries: a systematic scoping review#FTI#
#IRE#In this systematic scoping review, research on the inclusion of students with special education needs (SEN) in Nordic countries was reviewed to describe the scope and types of empirical research, identify the practices and approaches on the inclusion of students with SEN, and conceptually map how particular concepts (i.e., inclusion, SEN) are referred to by the authors of each study in the empirical literature. Based on a comprehensive literature search of relevant peer-reviewed articles and book chapters in three databases, 135 studies were selected as eligible in line with the a priori defined inclusion criteria. Results highlight that there still is a need to clarify perspectives on inclusion and on who needs support, and quantitative and mixed-method studies on actual practices and student outcomes including students’ perspectives are needed#FRE#
