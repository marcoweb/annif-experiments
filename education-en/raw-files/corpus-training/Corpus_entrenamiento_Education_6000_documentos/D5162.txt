#ITI#Notions of Creativity in Mathematics Education Research: a Systematic Literature Review#FTI#
#IRE#Interest in creativity in mathematics education research is increasing, and the field of research is growing. Yet, research on creativity and the notions (we use this wording to accumulate understandings, beliefs, and ideas about the construct) of creativity that are addressed in empirical research are diverse and difficult to organize in an overview, with different theoretical backgrounds and theoretical assumptions underlying them. The aim of this article is therefore to provide a systematic overview of notions of creativity addressed in recent empirical research on mathematical education. We conducted a systematic literature review, guided by the question, What notions of creativity are addressed in current mathematics education research and what theoretical foundations do they rely on? The article gives an overview of the five predominant notions of creativity that were identified in current empirical research in mathematics education from 2006 to 2019. We describe and evaluate these notions and identify trends that will help to structure this diverse field of research#FRE#
