#ITI#Ultrasonography is an effective tool for breast cancer screening in individuals with severe motor and intellectual disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Individuals with severe motor and intellectual disabilities have become an aging population, and high cancer morbidity and mortality are critical issues affecting their survival. Cancer screening is a crucial method of resolving this issue; however, a suitable screening method for them has not been established. Methods: We used ultrasonography alone and performed breast cancer screening for women over 30 years old in our facility from 2016 to 2023. We observed the outcomes and calculated the recall/detection rate in this screening. Results: Three cases among 379 tested positive in this screening, all of which underwent radical surgery. They are alive and well without relapse present. We detected these breast cancer cases with a low recall rate. Conclusion: We were able to successfully detect breast cancer cases using ultrasonography alone. Ultrasonography is an effective and feasible tool for breast cancer screening in individuals with severe motor and intellectual disabilities#FRE#
