#ITI#Mobile Performance Support Systems: Characteristics, Benefits, and Conditions#FTI#
#IRE#Mobile performance support systems (MPSS) involve the use of handheld and wearable devices to assist workers to complete job tasks that are not tied to a fixed location. This paper acknowledges MPSS as an emerging human performance technology (HPT) intervention and distinguishes the differences between mobile learning and MPSS. MPSS focuses on performance outcomes, whereas mobile learning focuses on learning outcomes. The paper presents a review of the foundations for MPSS while focusing on its delivery methods, characteristics, benefits, and use conditions in the workplace. Implications for HPT practitioners to make informed decisions when considering adopting MPSS in their organizations are provided#FRE#
