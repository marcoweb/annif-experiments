#ITI#Black Girls in Mathematics: (Re)envisioning an Inclusive Parent Involvement Measure#FTI#
#IRE# Building upon research utilizing Martin’s Mathematical Socialization and Identity Framework, we examine factors related to community and family involvement to advance the current discourse that informs policies. Data from the High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS:09) public-use file provided a sample of 1,029 Black girls for our analyses. We developed a theoretically-sound inclusive measure, as defined by Black girls, titled the Community and Family Involvement Predictive Scale for Mathematics Outcomes utilizing Nonlinear Principal Components Analysis with a Categorical Principal Components Analysis program. Results are an intersectional measure that considers family, peers, and teachers. Implications for policy include a need for federal, state, and district policymakers to consider a wider variety of contexts, specifically for Black girls, in which community and family partnerships are empowered and prioritized in policies focused on parental involvement.#FRE#
