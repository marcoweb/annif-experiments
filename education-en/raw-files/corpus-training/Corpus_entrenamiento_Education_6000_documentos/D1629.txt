#ITI#Integrating cognitive load theory with other theories, within and beyond educational psychology#FTI#
#IRE# Background and Aims: The long-standing aim of cognitive load theory (CLT) has been to generate instructional design principles that show teachers how to instruct students effectively, based on knowledge of the intricacies of human cognitive architecture. Historically, the focus of CLT has been on identifying cognitive processes related to learning and instruction. However, the theory has become more multidisciplinary over time, drawing on theoretical perspectives both within, and beyond, educational psychology. Results: This Editorial presents a brief historical overview of key developments in CLT and seven key themes that are pertinent to research on CLT. These themes are as follows: Level of Expertise, Cognitive Load Measurement, Embodied Cognition, Self-Regulated Learning, Emotion Induction, Replenishment of Working Memory, and Two Subprocessors of Working Memory. Summaries of the nine empirical contributions to the special issue are presented and discussed in relation to how they provide insight into one or more of these themes. Conclusions: Understanding the variables that impact student learning and instruction has always represented the core aim of CLT. The growing multidisciplinary features of CLT should provide researchers and practitioners with more holistic perspectives of the factors that predict student learning and, in turn, guide instructional design#FRE#
