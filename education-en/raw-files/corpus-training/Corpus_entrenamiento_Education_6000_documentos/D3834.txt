#ITI#Peer Aggression and Victimisation: Social Behaviour Strategies in Early Childhood in Spain#FTI#
#IRE#The present study aims to examine the issue of peer aggression and victimisation in early childhood, with a focus on the associated social behaviour strategies (aggressiveness, prosociality, dominance and social insecurity). A sample of 227 children (58.1% girls, n = 132) between the ages of 4 and 7 years (M = 5.61; SD = 1. 03) participated in the study. Teacher reports and peer nominations of physical and verbal aggression and victimisation were analysed. Results showed an association between aggressiveness and insecurity and being nominated as a physical and verbal aggressor by peers. Being nominated as a physical victim was associated with aggressiveness and dominance; and for verbal victim with aggressiveness and prosociality. Differences were found between boys and girls in verbal aggression and victimisation. The current study contributes to a better understanding of the emergence of peer aggression and victimisation in relation to social processes in early childhood and has implications for the prevention of the later appearance of bullying#FRE#
