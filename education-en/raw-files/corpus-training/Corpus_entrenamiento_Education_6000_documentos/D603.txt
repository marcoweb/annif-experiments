#ITI#Facilitating Educational Equity and Safety of Undocumented Immigrant Students#FTI#
#IRE# Immigration policies and deportations have negatively impacted not only undocumented immigrant students and their families, but also their teachers, administrators, counselors, and other community members. Drawing on Freire’s (1970) concept of praxis, and on critical-ecological educational approaches (da Silva Iddings, 2017), we interviewed educators to better understand the possibilities of partnerships between university-schools-communities to collaboratively facilitate educational equity and safety of undocumented immigrant students in U.S. schools. Thus, this article aims to shed light on ways to respond to the current sociopolitical and educational issues these students are facing and on ways to improve their schooling experiences.#FRE#
