#ITI#The Effect of STEM Research Experiences on Fields of Interest and Career Paths#FTI#
#IRE#There are studies that examine the impact of undergraduate research experiences on students, often concluding that there are benefits to such experiences. Using social career cognitive theory, our research aims to add to the literature by examining the long-term effects, including career path and inclusion in research field, of an undergraduate student research program. This research study used student testimony gathered through interviews to examine the influence of participation in an undergraduate STEM research experience for college first-year students that has been in place at the university for 10 years. Our main finding is that the influence of the experience on students’ field of interest and future career aspirations solidified or changed the career paths of 19 out of 20 students, further corroborating the previous research about undergraduate research experiences as high-impact practices. © National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan 2023.#FRE#
