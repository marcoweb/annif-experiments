#ITI#Exploring the use of virtual reality by pre-service elementary teachers for teaching science in the elementary classroom#FTI#
#IRE# This research was conducted on two groups of pre-service elementary teachers (PSETs) (N = 38) in a pre/post within-subjects design. Participants were asked to critique, create, and evaluate the use of virtual reality (VR) classroom applications during a three-stage intervention. Pre/post questionnaires assessed the change in attitudes toward using VR and technology when teaching. Participants felt significantly more ready to teach science using computer-based technology (t = 7.23, p <.0001) following the intervention. Qualitative analysis of responses showed that PSETs were positive about their VR experience and had come to see VR apps as supplementary educational tools. The majority of the PSET teams successfully created original instructional material using VR, increasing their self-efficacy#FRE#
