#ITI#The strength of Frontline Practice Leadership in Australian supported accommodation services: Challenges confronting service providers#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The strength of practice leadership predicts the quality of Active Support but it can be compromised by other demands on frontline managers. The study aimed to identify and understand differences in practice leadership over time and between organisations. Method: Data collected in 2022 in 96 services from 11 organisations using the Observed Measure of Practice Leadership were compared to similar data from 2013 and 2018. Qualitative fieldnotes were analysed thematically. Findings: Practice leadership scores increased significantly between 2013 and 2018 but declined significantly between 2018 and 2022. Scores were significantly higher in organisations that had implemented Active Support since 2013 compared to later adopters. Higher scoring organisations had structures that supported frontline managers with practice leadership and that countered increasing administrative demands. Conclusions: Establishment of support structures for practice leadership by organisations warrants further investigation together with the relative importance of each task of practice leadership#FRE#
