#ITI#The generativity of feminist and environmental cartoons for environmental education research and teaching#FTI#
#IRE#This article brings together a feminist environmentalist cartoonist with a feminist environmental educator in an exploration of the generativity of cartoons in environmental education research and teaching. Using duoethnography as a methodology, and drawing on critical and new materialist feminist theory, we explore our personal memories, stories, and conversations, as well as discussing the origins and/or significance of particular cultural artefacts (some of Judy’s cartoons), to illuminate the reasons for, and influences on, our engagement with cartoons, feminism, the environment, and formal environmental education. Drawing on a range of literature around humour and environmental education and feminism, juxtaposed with our conversations and the cartoons, we also seek to identify some possible ways of measuring what impact or influence cartoons about the environment might have once they are in the world, thereby exploring their generativity in environmental education research, theorizing and practice#FRE#
