#ITI#Polarization and the Politics of Education: What Moves Partisan Opinion?#FTI#
#IRE# This study explores the conditions under which polarization and depolarization occur with respect to public opinion on education issues. I analyze experimental and nonexperimental survey data to gauge the effects of informational and experiential stimuli on education policy preferences. I focus on heterogeneous effects by political party identification that result in increased or decreased polarization. I find evidence that the provision of education spending data has depolarizing consequences, but the effects of ideologically moderate policy endorsements vary by issue and year. I also find tentative evidence in favor of a link between having children in the household and reduced polarization.#FRE#
