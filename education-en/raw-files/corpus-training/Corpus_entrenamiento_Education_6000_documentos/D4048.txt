#ITI#Should you be using mobile technologies in teaching? Applying a pedagogical framework#FTI#
#IRE#The extent of how mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are seamlessly incorporated into the personal day-to-day life is not often considered by University instructors. Unfocused incorporation of mobile technologies into the classroom can de-emphasize intended learning objectives if students struggle to use the technology itself or by acting as a distraction. The effective inclusion of mobile technology is not a simple process as the intervention needs to be purposeful and have the potential to improve the student learning environment while working alongside more traditional face-to-face learning. This paper presents a pathway to help instructors address both pedagogical and technological considerations of incorporating mobile learning into the curriculum. The pathway developed through the adaptation of the iPAC framework, feedback from international practitioners and tested with worked examples. In all cases, the instructors’ reflective responses to the eight pathway questions indicate a clear structured activity, engaged students and considers equal access, prior experience and contingency planning. This pathway indicates an effective methodology for instructors to assess whether the mobile learning intervention is appropriate and adds value to their teaching. Further external evaluation of the pathway with additional teaching examples will enhance the effectiveness of the methodology#FRE#
