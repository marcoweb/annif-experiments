#ITI#Exploring the complex cognitive, affective and behavioural processes of individuals with intellectual disabilities in financially abusive situations#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Understanding the cognitive processes of individuals with intellectual disabilities in financially abusive situations is critical to develop effective prevention strategies. Aims: This study investigated how persons with intellectual disabilities define and analyse financially abusive situations, and how they would feel and act in situations that they consider abusive. Materials and Methods: Twelve participants with intellectual disabilities participated in a semi-structured interview where they were asked to reflect on three vignettes illustrating financial abuse. We analysed the interviews using thematic analysis. Findings: The findings revealed that individuals with intellectual disabilities considered the type of relationship between the victims and the perpetrators, the behavioural patterns of the perpetrators, and their own experiences when interpreting the situation. Furthermore, they discussed their emotional and behavioural reactions to the vignettes. Conclusion: This study has important implications in supporting the autonomy and decision-making rights of persons with intellectual disabilities regarding their finances and developing effective preventions against financial abuse among this population#FRE#
