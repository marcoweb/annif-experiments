#ITI#Mobilizing theory through practice: authentic learning in teaching mobilities#FTI#
#IRE#This paper reflects on recent teaching and learning practices in two undergraduate human geography modules at the University of the Western Cape: GES111 Introduction to Human Geography and GES225 Space, Place and Mobility in Southern Africa. Content in both modules focuses on mobilities theory and its application toward understanding the shaping of space, place and subjectivity. Teaching and learning activities in both modules include student-generated knowledge through reflections on everyday mobility in the form of e-learning activities and autoethnographic essays. Using examples from teaching and learning activities in both modules, this paper considers the role of e-learning and mobile diaries as a link between theory and practice, where the latter serves as a means of illuminating and demystifying the former. Results from learning activities exemplify the innate understanding of critical concepts in mobilities studies, including the experience of movement, its meanings, and practices within the context of the global South. Comments from student evaluations demonstrate the importance of making connections between theory and practice, at the same time, the mobile diary method serves as an innovative practice of teaching, learning and student assessment#FRE#
