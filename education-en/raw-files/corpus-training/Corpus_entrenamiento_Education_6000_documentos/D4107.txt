#ITI#Building bridges: the impact of scaffolds in PBL on the learning of South African pre-service geography teachers#FTI#
#IRE#This study explores pre-service geography teachers’ assessment of the impact of hard and soft scaffolds used in problem-based learning on their own learning. Respondents had to complete a “Scaffolds in geography problem-based learning” instrument after the problem-based learning intervention. The respondents could also elaborate on the impact of the scaffolds on their learning in the comments section of the instrument. The results indicated that most of the respondents perceived that all the scaffolds used in the problem-based learning activities had a positive impact on their learning. The soft scaffolds were perceived to have a higher impact on their learning compared to the hard scaffolds. Most of the respondents highlighted in their comments the important impact of the facilitator and group members on their learning. In addition, they indicated the important role of the training video and workshop on problem-based learning as examples of hard scaffolds to give them a good understanding of problem-based learning. No gender differences in the respondents’ perceptions of the impact of scaffolds in problem-based intervention on their learning were reported. Respondents with high academic performance in geography rated the impact of the scaffolds on their learning to be larger compared to the lower academic performers#FRE#
