#ITI#Queer Activist Leadership: An Exploration of Queer Leadership in Higher Education#FTI#
#IRE#Higher Education has witnessed an increase in support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities on college campuses. Despite this slow growth, many colleges and university climates remain largely unwelcoming to LGBTQ students, faculty, and staff. Student activism has largely been responsible for this growth, supported by staff and faculty advocates. This qualitative case study explored the tactics and strategies staff and faculty leveraged in advancing LGBTQ equity at Rural Public University in the Midwestern United States. The study advances a conceptual framework for queer activist leadership in higher education. Findings reveal how a small network of campus leaders engaged in queer leadership strategies through queer centered activism to advance LGBTQ equity in institutional policy and practice. Findings reveal rich implications for college administrators and higher education leaders advancing change for LGBTQ equit#FRE#
