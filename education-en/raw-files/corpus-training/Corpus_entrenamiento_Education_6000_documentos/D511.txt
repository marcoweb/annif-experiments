#ITI#Indigenous Girls Write, Right!? Unsettling Urban Literacies with Indigenous Writing Pedagogies#FTI#
#IRE# This article begins with the fundamental premise that Indigenous adolescent girls are writers. Indigenous adolescent girls speak and write in multitudes of voices, yet their physical and literary presence is often unaccounted in educational research and writing. Guided by the theoretical insights of Chicana Feminist Epistemology and Tribal Critical Race Theory this paper illuminates how Indigenous Writing Pedagogies (IWP) emerged to acknowledge land and gendered relationships in urban schools. The author presents implications for Indigenous notions of literacies and relationships that can be elevated by educators working in and out of urban school spaces.#FRE#
