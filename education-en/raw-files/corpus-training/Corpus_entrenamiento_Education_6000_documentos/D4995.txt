#ITI#Finding Their Way: Exploring the Experiences of Tenured Black Women Faculty#FTI#
#IRE#This study uses Black feminist thought to explore the experiences of Black women faculty that earned tenure and promotion to associate professor. We found that participants who reported positive experiences on the tenure track received strong support from various sources. Conversely, those devoid of competent support consistently reported negative experiences. Collectively, our participants’ narratives offer insight into the importance of mentoring and departmental leadership to support Black women junior faculty’s well-being and potential career contributions. Based on our theoretical considerations and findings, we argue for more robust mentoring and support policy and praxis for Black women faculty that requires broader investment and participation from university stakeholders at all levels. Finally, we close with directions for future research#FRE#
