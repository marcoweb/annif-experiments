#ITI#Measuring Unipolar Traits With Continuous Response Items: Some Methodological and Substantive Developments#FTI#
#IRE# In recent years, some models for binary and graded format responses have been proposed to assess unipolar variables or “quasi-traits.” These studies have mainly focused on clinical variables that have traditionally been treated as bipolar traits. In the present study, we have made a proposal for unipolar traits measured with continuous response items. The proposed log-logistic continuous unipolar model (LL-C) is remarkably simple and is more similar to the original binary formulation than the graded extensions, which is an advantage. Furthermore, considering that irrational, extreme, or polarizing beliefs could be another domain of unipolar variables, we have applied this proposal to an empirical example of superstitious beliefs. The results suggest that, in certain cases, the standard linear model can be a good approximation to the LL-C model in terms of parameter estimation and goodness of fit, but not trait estimates and their accuracy. The results also show the importance of considering the unipolar nature of this kind of trait when predicting criterion variables, since the validity results were clearly different.#FRE#
