#IRE#This study examined which success factors young adults with mild intellectual disability highlight in their school-work transition. The study was based on qualitative interviews with ten young adults with intellectual disability who obtained competitive employment after upper secondary school. A thematic, structural analysis was conducted to identify the themes. During the interviews, we explored how participants valued the importance of psychological traits, personal characteristics, and environmental factors for their successful school-work transition, and indeed, each of these were considered relevant to them. Participants identified self-determination, soft skills, parental/family support, wider network support, school-workplace collaboration, inclusive work environment, and individual accommodations at the workplace as important for their transition to work. The article discusses implications for practice, so that more young adults with intellectual disability may gain access to the labour market#FRE#
