#ITI#Where Do They Go? An Investigation of K-12 Online Learners Process for Obtaining Support#FTI#
#IRE#Full-time K-12 online learners faced little impact when schools had to rapidly transition to remote learning in March 2020. Essentially, everyone found themselves in the same position that full-time K-12 online learners had been prior to the pandemic. It is the experiences of supplemental K-12 online learners, those students who normally have school-based supports as a part of their course and personal communities, who have the potential to provide lessons for future short-term and long-term school closures. This article reports on a case study of K-12 students in one rural school engaged in online learning in a supplemental program, and the process that they undertook when they needed academic support#FRE#
