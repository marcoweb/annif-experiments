#ITI#The unsung role of assessment and feedback in self-directed learning (SDL)#FTI#
#IRE#Assessment and feedback have been intensively studied to promote effective learning. However, less attention is given on its role in self-directed learning (SDL) context. Despite being recognised as a powerful educational tool, critical examination of SDL and assessment and feedback literature reveals that these bodies of literature rarely intersect with one another. This study, which aims to investigate teacher educators’ practices of assessment and feedback in the context of SDL, begins to address the gap. Twenty Malaysian teacher educators were interviewed, and the interview data were analysed using a hybrid thematic analysis approach. Findings suggest the importance of (i) reducing anxiety in assessment and feedback, (ii) practicing sustainable formative assessment, (iii) ensuring timely feedback, and (iv) responding to cultural norms. These findings address key features of assessment and feedback in promoting SDL, however greater emphasis is needed in developing a framework of assessment and feedback that supports SDL#FRE#
