#ITI#Physical activity, sports participation and school exclusion: An analysis of the millennium cohort study#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Physical activity and modes of sport are widely adopted to promote health, wellbeing, behavioural outcomes and educational attainment in young people excluded from education. However, little is known about the physical activity or sports involvement of excluded young people or the role of participation on predictors and outcomes associated with exclusion. Aims: The study aimed to understand (i) how active excluded young people are, (ii) whether predictors of school exclusion are influenced by participation in physical activity or sport and (iii) if physical activity or sports participation moderates the relationship between school exclusion and health, behavioural and educational outcomes. Methods: Millennium Cohort Study Wave 6 data were analysed using linear multiple regression models. Participants were 11,066 young people. Dependent variables were physical activity or sports participation. Independent variables included school exclusion, body composition and physical health, cognitive and educational outcomes, crime, anti-social and harmful behaviours, mental health and individual demographic predictors. Results: Multiple regression analysis of Millennium Cohort Study Wave 6 data indicates young people excluded from education participate in more (+20.71 ± 9.72, p =.03) minutes of physical activity but less (−22.38 ± 32.52, p =.49) minutes of sport than non-excluded participants. Physical activity or sport did not influence predictors or outcomes associated with exclusion. Conclusion: Findings indicate young people excluded from education participate in 8% more MVPA, but 13% less sport than peers not excluded from education. These findings highlight concerns related to the provision of school sports and physical education opportunities for young people excluded from education. Moreover, these findings question the role of physical activity or sport as a silver bullet within UK educational policy#FRE#
