#ITI#An Analysis of Online and Hybrid EdD Programs in Educational Technology#FTI#
#IRE#Doctor of Education (EdD) programs have experienced much development and attention in the last two decades. Simultaneously, the steady growth of online education has resulted in several universities offering online EdD programs, including in Educational Technology and related fields. This article provides an overview of the structure and goals of online and hybrid EdD programs in Educational Technology and related fields. Data collected from the websites of 13 highly ranked online and hybrid EdD programs in Educational Technology and a follow-up survey with program coordinators was analyzed for the program foci, length, delivery format, dissertation formats and processes, and professional outcomes. The structure of these programs, curriculum (core courses, specialized courses, research courses, dissertation credits) and professional outcomes are presented, and areas of consideration for others embarking on creating online or hybrid EdD programs and those engaged in improving their existing programs are provided#FRE#
