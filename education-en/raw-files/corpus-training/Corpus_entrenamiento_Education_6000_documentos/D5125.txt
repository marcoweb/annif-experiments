#ITI#Some antecedents of directed motivational currents in a foreign language#FTI#
#IRE#Directed Motivational Currents (DMCs) are highly intense goal-directed motivational experiences that are characterised by establishing new routines and having positive emotions. The present study aimed to identify the factors that triggered the launch of DMCs among EFL learners. An interview protocol designed based on the core dimensions of the DMC framework [Dörnyei, Z., A. Henry, and C. Muir. 2016. Motivational Currents in Language Learning: Frameworks for Focused Interventions. New York: Routledge] was used to collect the data. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the interview data. The results showed that DMCs experienced by the participants were triggered by others-related (i.e. goal contagion and salient others) as well as social-situational factors (i.e. critical life incidents, ego threat, responsibility). Finally, the pedagogical implications and suggestions for future research are presented#FRE#
