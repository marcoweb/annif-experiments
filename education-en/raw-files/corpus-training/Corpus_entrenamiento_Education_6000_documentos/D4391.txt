#IRE#The purpose of this study is to explore the implications of a standards-based curriculum for what constitutes knowledge in different teaching contexts. The research question is as follows: How is the logic of uniformity within curriculum standards recontextualised into actual teaching in different school environments, here focusing on the concepts of the knowledge underpinning the teaching? Many national school systems have adapted to the current accountability movement. The accountability movement is characterised by seemingly simple and reasonable logic that defines objectives to specify what schooling should result in for learners, evaluates the result and then uses the result to improve the schooling process. In reality, however, the recontextualisation of the subject curriculum to teaching practice is a complex process. This article draws on interviews with two teachers focusing on eight recently completed lessons. The analysis reveals two approaches to curricula—integrated and performance—underpinned by two different views of knowledge: transactional realism and social realism. Although the key aim for teaching based on transactional realism is ‘coordinating the students’ interest in’ the curriculum and teaching content, the key aim for teaching based on social realism is ‘giving the students access to’ specialised knowledge#FRE#
