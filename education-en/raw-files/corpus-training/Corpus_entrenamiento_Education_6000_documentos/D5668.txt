#ITI#The inclusion of students who are most vulnerable to exclusion via cooperative learning. A longitudinal case-study#FTI#
#IRE#Research into the effectiveness of cooperative learning for students who encounter barriers to participation and learning, and for those who show resistance to cooperative learning, produces poor results because learning strategies do not always incorporate the essential elements of cooperative learning. For this reason, in this study we intend to show how the factors of competence for cooperative learning evolved over 6 terms in base teams, in students with resistance to cooperative learning and in one student diagnosed with ADHD. This was a longitudinal case study where qualitative research instruments were used, carried out in a rural classroom. The results show how the base teams (class-group) evolved, how the resistant students and the ADHD student evolved, and offer pointers to cooperative proposals that should be developed in a class-group, considering the different learning needs of students#FRE#
