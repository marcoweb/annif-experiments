#ITI#A case study of process performances during a small-group activity: comparison between a round-shaped and a crescent-shaped seating arrangements in studio-style learning spaces#FTI#
#IRE#This research explored the best shapes and layouts of seating arrangements for fostering process performances of students in studio-style learning spaces, which have emerged in the development of collaborative learning environments in higher education. We conducted a design case study to explore both team and individual process performances during a small-group activity in a round-shaped and a crescent-shaped seating arrangement. Evaluators observed and measured the individual process performance of each group member together with the team process performances of each group. All factor scores of the individual process performance were higher in the crescent-shaped seating arrangement than in the round-shaped seating arrangement, with substantive effect sizes. In the group process performance, the factor scores of ‘planning and process’ and ‘independence and leadership’ in the crescent-shaped seating arrangement were substantially higher than those of the round-shaped arrangement, indicating that the crescent-shaped seating arrangement fostered students’ ability to collaborate responsibly in their project work. Video analysis revealed that groups in the crescent-shaped layout tended to have more eye-contact and to spend less time planning, which indicates that such sociopetal effects have the potential to promote efficiency in the discussion between people seated in a crescent-shaped arrangement. We discuss the necessity to take students’ seating arrangements into consideration regarding the sociopetal, as well as a proximal focal point and less-disparate distance between the leader and other participants to allow them to engage in their own work better#FRE#
