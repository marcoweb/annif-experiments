#ITI#Symptom Presence and Symptom Severity as Unique Indicators of Psychopathology: An Application of Multidimensional Zero-Inflated and Hurdle Graded Response Models#FTI#
#IRE# Questionnaires inquiring about psychopathology symptoms often produce data with excess zeros or the equivalent (e.g., none, never, and not at all). This type of zero inflation is especially common in nonclinical samples in which many people do not exhibit psychopathology, and if unaccounted for, can result in biased parameter estimates when fitting latent variable models. In the present research, we adopt a maximum likelihood approach in fitting multidimensional zero-inflated and hurdle graded response models to data from a psychological distress measure. These models include two latent variables: susceptibility, which relates to the probability of endorsing the symptom at all, and severity, which relates to the frequency of the symptom, given its presence. After estimating model parameters, we compute susceptibility and severity scale scores and include them as explanatory variables in modeling health-related criterion measures (e.g., suicide attempts, diagnosis of major depressive disorder). Results indicate that susceptibility and severity uniquely and differentially predict other health outcomes, which suggests that symptom presence and symptom severity are unique indicators of psychopathology and both may be clinically useful. Psychometric and clinical implications are discussed, including scale score reliability.#FRE#
