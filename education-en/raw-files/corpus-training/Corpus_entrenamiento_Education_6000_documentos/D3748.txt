#ITI#Governing in the time of Covid-19: how board meetings went online and the implications of this for considering the role of the governing board#FTI#
#IRE#The response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 necessitated changes in the working practices of many organisations such that online meetings suddenly became the norm. Governing board meetings were no exception. However, little is known about the impact of online meetings on the work of boards. Here we draw on empirical evidence from observations of in-person and online board meetings in eight colleges of further education across the UK to address the question: in what ways do governing board meetings differ in online and in-person contexts? From this we consider what this tells us about the role of the board in the life of the organisation. We conclude that social gathering, which emphasises the importance of place, is of central importance in the work of the board#FRE#
