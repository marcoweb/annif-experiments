#ITI#Sensitivity, shared purpose, and learning community: a case study of a Brazilian sport program with children and young people from socially vulnerable backgrounds#FTI#
#IRE# Purpose: This article draws on the Long-Term Program Development framework [Siwik, M., A. Lambert, D. Saylor, R. Bertram, C. Cocchiarella, and W. Gilbert. 2015. “Long Term Program Development (LTPD): An Interdisciplinary Framework for Developing Athletes, Coaches, and Sport Programs.” International Sport Coaching Journal 2 (3): 305–316. doi:10.1123/iscj.2015-0075] to examine the strategies employed by a Brazilian sport program to address complex issues faced by children and young people from socially vulnerable backgrounds. Participants and settings: This study took place in a non-governmental organization (NGO) sport program in Brazil. Participants included the founder of the sport program, a manager, two coordinators, five coaches, and a social worker. In addition, parents participated in a focus group. Research design: This research adopted a case study design. Data collection included: (a) individual interviews with program employees; (b) focus group interviews with parents; (c) lead researcher observations collected as field notes; and (d) document analysis. Findings: The findings highlighted three distinct themes. First, the program employees showed sensitivity to the specific characteristics of the socially vulnerable context, understanding that violence and lack of access were the main issues children and young people faced in their communities. Second, the program management team and the coaches recognized and agreed on a shared purpose for the sport program. They collaboratively reflected on a shared purpose, moving from focusing on teaching sport-techniques to include developing socio-emotional learning that would contribute to success in different aspects of life. Finally, a learning community had a central role in the program’s functioning. The learning community was the reason why there was a shared purpose among providers and a recognition and sensitivity of the specific characteristics of the socially vulnerable context. Implications: The Long-Term Program Development framework provided a unique insight into the strategies employed by the NGO to achieve its goals and the key points that helped the NGO to succeed in its actions. This framework stressed the intricate parts of program managing, from the need to establish and share a purpose, to the context where one will be acting, to the importance of supporting these two parts with a learning environment and a sense of community#FRE#
