#ITI#School-Based Mental Health Practitioners: A Resource Guide for Educational Leaders#FTI#
#IRE#School-based mental health practitioners can offer enhanced support to schools and students; yet their training, roles, and expertise vary. The roles of these professionals are often conflated, misunderstood, or marginalized in their utility throughout the school system. The purpose of this manuscript is to enhance the capacity of educational leaders to make informed hiring, contracting, and role assignment decisions that best fit school and student needs regarding school mental health services. We clarify the landscape of two distinct groups of qualified school mental health professionals-those who are education certified and those who are independently licensed; each group represents professionals from multiple disciplines. We illuminate similarities and differences of these professionals and juxtapose the utility of traditional mental health versus school-based mental health. We then discuss the similarities and differences of qualified school mental health professionals described within the context of traditional and school-based mental health preparation and service delivery. We conclude by contributing three resources for educational leaders to support the process of engaging school-based mental health practitioners. First, we offer a planning guide to understand state variations in certification requirements across professionals. Second, we provide a hiring guide primer that summarizes education requirements and delineates role orientations for school mental health practitioners. Third, we provide an interview guide to help clarify a candidate’s experience and skills useful to contemporary school needs. We conclude by offering recommendations for educational leaders to become more effective consumers of school-based mental health services#FRE#
