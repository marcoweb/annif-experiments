#ITI#Learning towards environmental sustainability practices: insights from a values-based participatory research approach#FTI#
#IRE#Transformative Learning Theory is instrumental in fostering sustained positive change in adult learners as it explains how critical reflection in crystallization processes results in emancipatory learning. Despite its relevance, there is no reliable approach that can systematically produce Transformational Learning for sustainability purposes. This article presents a case study that adopted a systematic approach to investigate if the approach can stimulate environmentally sustainable practices among international university students and discusses implications for sustainability. Using an open-ended questionnaire and focus group before the intervention and then focus groups and interviews after the intervention, data were collected and compared to assess learning outcomes gained with regards to environmentally sustainable practices. Findings show transformed worldviews, epistemological, ontological and behavioral perspectives towards environmentally sustainable practices. Also, the study reports emancipated knowledge, broadened discriminatory & reflective capabilities, increased consciousness and sense of responsibility gained by the students. Desirable estimates of Kappa’s Inter-rater reliability coefficient shows that the analytical rubric for identifying Transformational Learning Outcomes used was a useful tool recommended for researchers.
