#ITI#Opening the black box of degree classification algorithms: towards a research agenda#FTI#
#IRE#Higher education systems exhibit varying degrees of heterogeneity in approaches to undergraduate degree classification–specifically for this Point of Departure: the wide variety of ‘Degree Classification Algorithms’ (DCAs) used to calculate students’ final awards. To date, the impact of DCA variation remains an under-researched ‘black box’, and whilst isolated institutional case studies have drawn attention to some underlying tensions, we posit a research agenda that calls for further evidence–from a sector, institutional, and student perspective. From a social justice perspective we argue that such variation has the potential to increase inequity of degree outcomes; increase scepticism from employers about degree classification; and impact student performance. This article draws on the UK as a country case study with significant institutional diversity in DCAs. The research findings can inform sector-wide and international research and policymaking in relation to DCA approaches#FRE#
