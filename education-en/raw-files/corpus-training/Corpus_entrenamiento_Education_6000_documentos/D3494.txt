#ITI#Should inclusion have an expiry date? Older people's attitudes on intellectual disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Older people with intellectual disabilities represent a new and neglected population in need of services, yet it may be problematic to include them in generic services without having a clear idea of how elderly people from the general population feel towards them. To the best of our knowledge, this topic has not been addressed quantitatively. Method: Seventy-three participants over 63 years of age (23 females and 50 males) from the general population without an intellectual disability completed two valid measures: the CLAS-MR and the WHOQOL-OLD. Results: Level of education and quality of life were positively associated with attitudes towards people with intellectual disabilities. Age was negatively associated with knowledge regarding intellectual disability. Conclusions: When preparing for the inclusion of older people with intellectual disabilities in generic services, attention should be given to members' level of education, quality of life, and knowledge regarding intellectual disabilities. Sensitivity should be applied to potential tendencies to shelter people with intellectual disabilities#FRE#
