#ITI#Inclusion or infringement? A systematic research review of students' perspectives on student privacy in technology-enhanced, hybrid and online courses#FTI#
#IRE# This systematic review involved reexamining student perceptions of privacy in online, hybrid and technology-enhanced courses. The research questions included identifying key findings from studies on student privacy. The researchers followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology and completed three rounds of searching for studies, including general searches in Academic Search Complete and Education Research Complete and a targeted search using Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria for the studies were as follows: empirical data on privacy from students' perspectives, higher education setting and published in a top 10 educational technology journal. Once the articles were identified, they were screened and coded independently by two reviewers, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. A narrative synthesis outlined three key themes from the original studies: privacy comforts, privacy concerns and privacy compromises. The study concluded with a discussion of the current state of knowledge of student privacy in online, hybrid and technology-enhanced courses, highlighting the need for greater focus on the balance of students' privacy and technology integration in higher education. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Integration of technology in higher education can pose student privacy concerns. Aspects of online and technology-supported courses can potentially compromise student privacy. Personal information collected or shared without consent can be an issue. Digital tools and platforms used in online and hybrid courses can be associated with privacy risks. Learning management systems, online exams, virtual simulations and immersive virtual reality can pose privacy risks for students. Previous syntheses have explored technology in higher education but not from the students' perspectives across various course formats. What this paper adds This systematic review provides information about students' perspectives on privacy in online, hybrid and technology-enhanced courses. It offers a comprehensive analysis of key findings from studies on student privacy, including privacy comforts, concerns and compromises. It shares insight into how students perceive privacy concerns in online, hybrid and technology-supported learning and how these concerns might be addressed. It emphasizes the need for greater attention to the balance of students' privacy and technology integration in higher education. Implications for practice and/or policy The findings of this paper have important implications for policy and practice in higher education. Institutions should provide clear guidelines and policies on data privacy and security in online, hybrid and technology-supported learning environments, including transparent information on data collection, storage and usage. Institutions should prioritize the use of secure platforms and tools that protect students' data and privacy. Involving students in decision-making around technology integration and privacy policies can provide valuable insights and help develop policies that are responsive to their needs. Institutions should provide training and support to students focused on digital literacy and data privacy to empower them to take ownership of their privacy and security in online and technology-supported learning environments#FRE#
