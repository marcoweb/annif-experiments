#ITI#How to become an inclusive teacher? Advice from Spanish educators involved in early childhood, primary, secondary and higher education#FTI#
#IRE#Through the voices of 100 Spanish teachers from Early Childhood, Primary, Secondary and Higher Education who carry out inclusive practices, this study explores the recommendations of these professionals for other colleagues to be inclusive. We conducted a qualitative multicase study using semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed through an inductive category and coding system. The findings are presented based on four topics: teacher planning, methodologies, ethical and emotional competences, and training. The results show similarities and differences between the guidelines given at different educational levels. This research provides practical lessons and it highlights that it is possible to be inclusive at any educational stage#FRE#
