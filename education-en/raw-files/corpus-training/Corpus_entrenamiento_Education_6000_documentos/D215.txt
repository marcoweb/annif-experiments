#ITI#Interrogating Policy Diffusion in the Arts Education Sphere#FTI#
#IRE# Defined as the tendency for structures and groups to “grow more alike, to develop similarities” policy convergence is a recognized factor in policy analysis across fields. In the arts education sphere, this can mean adopting similar curriculum standards, imitating an after-school arts program, or even borrowing a large-scale metropolitan arts education partnership model. I argue that policy diffusion helps to illuminate policy convergence in the arts education milieu. In this policy analysis essay, I first detail the conceptual underpinnings of policy diffusion. Next, I offer specific examples from arts education and attempt to show how they exemplify mechanisms of diffusion. I then argue that there are specific contexts/structures within arts education policymaking that facilitate diffusion, and I conclude with discussion based on the analysis.#FRE#
