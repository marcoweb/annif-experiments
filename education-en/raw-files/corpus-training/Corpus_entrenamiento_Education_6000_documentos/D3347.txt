#ITI#Foreign partnership in Indian higher education: significance, challenges and concerns#FTI#
#IRE#India, as a developing nation, is consistently progressing in the education field. While Indian higher education has expanded tremendously in terms of enrolment, the country has failed to produce an adequate number of world-class universities. Researchers have analysed challenges like demand-supply gap, lack of quality research and innovation, inadequate infrastructure, shortage of quality faculty, etc. Worldwide higher education policies have been transformed by various internationalisation processes that operate in a constant flux of globalisation. Given the projected demand for massification and quality improvements needed, internationalisation of higher education has become an important national goal in India. This paper conceptualises the importance of foreign partnerships in the Indian higher education sector. It delineates major challenges for the foreign enterprises to enter the Indian higher education market and highlights some recent developments on policy initiatives and schemes initiated by the Indian government to bring higher education at par with international standards. Specific hindrances of foreign partnerships in the higher education sector have also been discussed. In conclusion, this paper critically argues for formulating useful regulatory guidelines for foreign partnerships by fostering research on understanding the policy and management of the Indian higher education system#FRE#
