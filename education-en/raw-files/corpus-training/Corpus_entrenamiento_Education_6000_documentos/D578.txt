#ITI#Protect Black Women Teachers: Influencing Sustainability Through Mental Health Literacy#FTI#
#IRE# Critical Black women teachers (BWTs) play a vital role in education. They employ pedagogies that are political in nature and effective in outcome, particularly for Black students in urban schools. However, despite their impact, BWTs leave the profession at rates higher than all other teachers. Therefore, this study engaged sista circle methodology to explore how post-service critical BWTs reflected on their teaching experiences, specifically regarding their mental health and the role it had on their decision to leave the profession. Based on the findings, recommendations are made to key stakeholders to support critical BWTs’ mental health and sustainability in urban schools.#FRE#
