#ITI#Challenges, strategies and self-efficacy of teachers supporting autistic pupils in contrasting school settings: a qualitative study#FTI#
#IRE#There is general support among teachers for inclusion of children with special educational needs, but many lack the confidence and knowledge to support autistic pupils. This can have an adverse effect on their education. Previous studies have explored the attitudes of teachers towards inclusion, but less is known about the experiences of teachers from contrasting school settings regarding autistic pupils. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve teachers from mainstream and special schools. Questions explored the school provision for autistic pupils, including strategies relating to their learning, friendships, bullying and general inclusion. Thematic analysis identified themes describing teachers’ challenges supporting autistic children, strategies they adopt to facilitate achievement and the influence of factors such as staff training/expertise, educational ideology, attitudes and the physical environment. Overall, it is argued that, besides the structural differences between mainstream and special schools, there remain a number of additional factors impacting teachers’ sense of self-efficacy. These are discussed in relation to recent research perspectives advocating an inclusive educational pedagogy#FRE#
