#ITI#Experiencing semester abroad programs in a Thai higher educational institution: sociocultural adaptation and cultural challenges of German exchange students#FTI#
#IRE#In the initial phase of participating in short-term semester abroad programs, newly arrived international students may face a lot of difficulties and challenging experiences living in Thai society. This phenomenological study reports on the issues of socio-cultural adaptation experienced by German exchange students while participating in semester abroad programs at a Thai university and mechanisms through which to address the concerns. From 109 students’ interview transcripts, the six groups of themes identified were (1) language barrier issues; (2) interpersonal communication issues; (3) academic-related issues; (4) personal interest/community involvement issues; (5) ecological adaptation issues; and (6) extra-curricular activity issues. The findings from this present study have implications for educators and all stakeholders working in the departments of international affairs and university administration to establish policies and practices for providing social support and tailoring study abroad programs to meet international students’ expectations, needs, and satisfaction#FRE#
