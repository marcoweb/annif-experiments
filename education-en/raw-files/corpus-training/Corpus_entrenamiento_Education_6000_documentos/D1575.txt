#ITI#Identifying students who are off-track academically at the start of secondary school: The role of social-emotional learning trajectories#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Research shows that successfully transitioning from intermediate school to secondary school is pivotal for students to remain on track to graduate. Studies also indicate that a successful transition is a function not only of how prepared the students are academically but also whether they have the social-emotional learning (SEL) skills to succeed in a more independent secondary school environment. Aim: Yet, little is known about whether students’ SEL skills are stable over time, and if they are not, whether a student’s initial level of SEL skills at the start of intermediate school or change in SEL skills over time is a better indicator of whether the student will be off track academically in 9th grade. This study begins to investigate this issue. Sample: We use four years of longitudinal SEL data from students in a large urban district with a sample size of ~3,000 students per timepoint. Methods: We use several years of longitudinal SEL data to fit growth models for three constructs shown to be related to successfully transitioning to secondary school. In so doing, we examine whether a student’s mean SEL score in 6th grade (status) or growth between 6th and 8th grade is more predictive of being off track academically in 9th grade. Result: Results indicate that, while status is more frequently significant, growth for self-management is also predictive above and beyond status on that construct. Conclusion: Findings suggest that understanding how a student develops social-emotionally can improve identification of students not on track to succeed in high school#FRE#
