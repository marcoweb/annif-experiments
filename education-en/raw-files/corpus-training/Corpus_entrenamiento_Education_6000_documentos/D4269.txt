#ITI#Indigenous languages & education: Do we have the right agenda?#FTI#
#IRE#The language and cultural priorities in Australian Indigenous education have been priority areas since the inaugural national Indigenous education policy was launched in 1989. For over thirty years, these priorities have sat awkwardly in the largely non-Indigenous teaching profession and classroom teachers continue to struggle with how to embed these priorities into the education process, despite the efforts of Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority and their elaborations for application at curriculum and practice levels. In this article, I suggest that these language and cultural priorities are at cross-purposes with education priorities, and neither have helped to curb the demise of our Indigenous languages nor improved Indigenous students’ educational outcomes. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
