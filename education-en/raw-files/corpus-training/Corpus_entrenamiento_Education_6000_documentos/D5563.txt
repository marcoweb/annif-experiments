#ITI#Mathematically productive relationships (MPRs): a potentially effective classroom management approach#FTI#
#IRE#Positive teacher–student relationships are considered essential for effective classroom management. Thus, focusing efforts to understand better and strengthen teacher–student relationships in order to improve student outcome metrics is prudent. This study examined seven elementary teachers’ descriptions and enactment of mathematically productive relationships (MPRs), a type of teacher-student relationship, and their influence on classroom management practices. Teachers’ descriptions of MPRs incorporated four themes: (a) creating safe, mistake-friendly environments, (b) developing trust and respect between the teacher and the students, (c) establishing and maintaining clear and high expectations, and (d) ensuring that classrooms remain safe spaces. However, these features did not always appear in the teachers’ classrooms. The enactment of MPRs varied across cases, with the participants’ classroom management priorities lying along a continuum from behavioural management to cognitive engagement. Implications of MPRs and the influence of different classroom management practices on students’ learning opportunities are discussed#FRE#
