#ITI#Understanding why educational professionals engage with podcasts: Educational Podcasts Motivational Scale development and validation#FTI#
#IRE# Educational podcasts have become an increasingly prevalent media used to disseminate profession-specific information through easily accessible means. Despite the potential of educational podcasts as convenient and effective medium, there is a dearth of literature dedicated to the topic. Thus, using the Uses and Gratification framework, the psychometric properties of the Educational Podcasts Motivation Scale were examined, as well as the motivational factors that influence intention to listen to educational podcasts and recommend podcasts to others were explored. A sample of individuals in the field of education (n = 606), such as in-service K-12 teachers and higher education professors, were recruited for this study. This sample were randomly divided, and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted with the first set (n = 312) to identify underlying constructs, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) were employed with the second set (n = 294). The scale demonstrated strong psychometric properties and five distinct motivational factors were identified: Information Gathering, Flexibility in Use, Social Interaction, Entertainment, and Professional Encouragement. Several motivational factors had significant associations with the constructs of “intention” and “word-of-mouth”. This paper demonstrates both the unique motivational factors related to listening to educational podcasts and the motivational factors that overlap with other forms of media. Further examination of the underlying motivations to listen to educational podcasts is warranted. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Educational podcasts have become an increasingly prevalent media used to disseminate information to specific professions and fields that provide current practices and research information through easily accessible means. Educational podcasts have been found to be an effective tool to improve self-efficacy and knowledge around topics with educators and college students, as well as a means to develop communities of practice where educators share knowledge and experiences. Results of studies using the uses and gratifications framework to examine the gratifications for listening to podcasts have found an array of overlapping, and sometimes conflicting, gratifications from the use of podcasts. Those most often identified include entertainment, multitasking and convenience, social interaction, escapism and educational purposes. What this paper adds This paper outlined the development of the Educational Podcasts Motivation Scale and used an exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to demonstrate its strong psychometric properties. Five distinct motivational factors for why educators engage with educational podcasts were identified: (a) Information Gathering, (b) Flexibility in Use, (c) Social Interaction, (d) Entertainment and (e) Professional Encouragement. This paper identifies that educators are often most motivated to listen to educational podcasts due to constructs such as social interaction, flexibility in use and information gathering. Implications for practice and/or policy The findings in this paper demonstrate the perceived benefits and uses of educational podcasts as a learning tool, further establishing educational podcasts as a useful tool that should be incorporated into learning environments. The findings in this paper indicate that those embedding educational podcasts within learning activities and professional development should consider how to emphasise the flexibility, social interactions and learning aspects of these tools to promote the attractive features of this tool. Although this study sheds light on the reasons those in the field of education use this medium, additional research is needed to explore how and why these individuals engage with educational podcasts#FRE#
