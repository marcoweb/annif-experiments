#ITI#Biological evolution learning and computational thinking: Enhancing understanding through integration of disciplinary core knowledge and scientific practice#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess the integration of computational thinking with learning about biological evolution. Specifically, we investigated the effectiveness of a framework from a recently developed learning progression that emphasises the complex nature of teaching both computational thinking and biological evolution. Computational thinking is a concept introduced by relatively recent science education reform efforts. For many educators, the notion of computational thinking is unclear making it difficult to integrate into instruction. High school student participants engaged in a quasi-experimental design study. Interventions integrating computational thinking and evolution concepts were used synonymously with assessments to identify change in both student biological evolution knowledge and computational knowledge over time. Students deepened their knowledge in both areas; however, one intervention was more robust in increasing both knowledge of computational thinking and biological evolution. The results warrant future research in these areas and suggest that computational thinking deserves a much greater emphasis within biology classrooms. It also supports the learning progression’s model of weaving disciplinary core ideas with scientific practices to deepen students’ science learning#FRE#
