#ITI#Success and self-determination: a systematic review of the narratives of students and graduates with disabilities#FTI#
#IRE# The purpose of this article was to explore, from the perspective of students and graduates with disabilities, the skills that are necessary to be self-determined at university, why these are important, and how they can be developed to remain in university and graduate successfully. A systematic review, including 16 qualitative studies with a total of 303 participants, was carried out. The results provide information on: essential skills to facilitate self-determination and successful completion of university studies (problem-solving skills, learning about oneself, goal setting, self-management, self-advocacy) and attributes (autonomy, resilience, and empowerment); the reasons for being self-determined at university (achieving academic goals, overcoming barriers, demonstrating abilities, self-confidence, and academic success); and how self-determination can be learned at university (trial and error; family, faculty and peers; disability services; peers; specific programmes; and information technology communication). The conclusions are encouraging and show that self-determination can be learned in universities with the necessary supports#FRE#
