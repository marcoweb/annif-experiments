#ITI#What are they bringing with them? Understanding past science experiences of preservice elementary teachers and what they mean for the science methods course#FTI#
#IRE# This study sought to better understand how past science learning experiences affected preservice elementary teachers, both in terms of their own self-efficacy and their perceptions of science teaching and learning at the beginning of their science methods course. Following an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, this study first involved the collection of quantitative data and then the collection of more in-depth qualitative data. In the first phase, the quantitative data included the Draw-a-Science-Teacher-Test Checklist (DASTT-C) and the Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument (STEBI-B) of preservice elementary teachers. In the second phase of this study, selected science autobiographies written by these same preservice elementary teachers, were explored based on extremely high or low scores on one of the STEBI-B subscales and the DASTT-C. Based on the findings, these preservice elementary teachers used their past experiences with science as a foundation for how they perceived science and its instruction in the elementary classroom. Overall, these preservice elementary teachers have a desire to make science in the elementary grades a positive experience for their future students#FRE#
