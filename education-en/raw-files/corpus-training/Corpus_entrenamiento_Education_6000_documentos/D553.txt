#ITI#Redistribution of Labor to Prepare Teachers to Work in Inclusive Bilingual Classrooms#FTI#
#IRE# Urban contexts where children with a range of abilities, languages, and cultures are served demand unique teacher preparation models. This study contends that ensuring unrestrictive learning environments in inclusive bilingual classrooms, where multiple educators work together, requires teachers to attend to division-of-labor. Informed by cultural historical activity theory, this article explores the kinds of division-of-labor dynamics surfacing in 35 multivoiced postlesson discussions. The focus on division-of-labor surfaced the need for teachers to collectively attend to students’ learning while they “hold the center,” and purposefully centering student agency. The analysis offers insight for the preparation of teachers for inclusive bilingual classrooms.#FRE#
