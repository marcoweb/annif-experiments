#ITI#Use of an augmented reality sand table for satellite remote sensing education#FTI#
#IRE#This experiment utilized advanced visualization technology for the delivery of an introductory remote sensing lesson in an undergraduate geography course. Given the numerous immersive visualization solutions available, it is now possible to leverage the capabilities of augmented, mixed, and virtual reality (AR, MR, and VR) technology in a classroom learning environment. For instructors, it is important to understand how advanced visualization technologies can enhance the learning experience and enable greater knowledge retention. To validate the use of an AR sand table/sandbox in a group academic setting, approximately 400 participants were evaluated to assess the impact on students’ retention of both foundational and practical remote sensing concepts. This work represents a between-subjects design with two AR sand table experimental groups (instructor sand table interaction, and student sand table interaction) and one control group with no sand table exposure. The use of the AR sand table in a classroom environment was found to improve retention of foundational remote sensing knowledge and elevate the assessment performance for subjects identified as lower performers. © This work was authored as part of the Contributor’s official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.
