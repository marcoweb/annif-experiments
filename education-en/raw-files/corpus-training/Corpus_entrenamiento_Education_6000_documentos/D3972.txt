#ITI#Teaching science to students with special educational needs: a systematic review of science teaching-learning approaches in regular and special education settings#FTI#
#IRE#In this systematic review, a series of didactic proposals and experiences that have been developed over recent years in formal education are presented with the common purpose of ensuring that students with special educational needs learn science. Initially, only 54 publications on the topic were identified, which underlines the scarce research over the last 20 years and the small percentage of papers published in research journals and conference proceedings within this area. From among those publications, our review is focused on the 27 that report the implementation of didactic interventions: 11 at specific special education centres and 16 at regular educational centres. Explicit instruction was considered a fundamental strategy in the first group, while varied experiences and methods were among the most relevant approach in the second group. In addition, both educational environments involve learner-centred teaching approaches, with the implementation of inquiry-based and hands-on activities, in line with the general results of research in Science Education that does not specifically deal with SSEN. Ensuring that all learners have the opportunity to learn science requires more specific and complementary studies that consolidate the evidence of these results, taking into account the diversity of learners in classrooms for the benefit of all#FRE#
