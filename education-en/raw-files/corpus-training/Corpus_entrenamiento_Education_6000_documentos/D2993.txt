#ITI#Factors Contributing to Teacher Burnout During COVID-19#FTI#
#IRE# As teachers returned to the classroom for the 2020â€“2021 school year, they faced new and challenging environments, instructional approaches, and roles as educators. The current study is one of the first empirical studies that identified factors contributing to teacher burnout due to COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) and instruction during fall 2020. Controlling for demographics, the results found significant predictors for teacher burnout-stress those being COVID-19 anxiety, current teaching anxiety, anxiety communicating with parents, and administrative support. The results are important for schools and researchers to consider when it comes to the impact of COVID-19 on teachers#FRE#
