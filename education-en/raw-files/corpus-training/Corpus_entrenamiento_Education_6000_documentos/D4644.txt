#ITI#Exploring preservice teacher self-reported and enacted TPACK after participating in a learning activity types short course#FTI#
#IRE#Preparing preservice teachers to teach effectively with digital technologies and media (DTM) is at the heart of initial teacher preparation as digital access continues to increase throughout society. The development of preservice teacher technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is important in order to create DTM-rich instruction. This study investigated preservice teacher self-reported and enacted TPACK after participating in learning activity types short courses, and the relationship between preservice teacher perceptions and observed practice. Data collection occurred using a pre-post self-report survey and preservice teacher lesson plans collected before and after short course implementation in two educational technology courses. Results from structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis indicated no significant differences in preservice teacher self-reported technological content knowledge (TCK), technological pedagogical knowledge (TPK), and TPACK, significant differences in preservice teacher enacted TCK, TPK, and TPACK, and no significant relationship between preservice teacher self-reported and enacted TPACK. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
