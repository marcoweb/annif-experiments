#ITI#Supporting Black women's pursuits in STEM#FTI#
#IRE# Research related to achievement in Science, Technology, Engineering & Math (STEM) does not provide a clear understanding of the conditions that influence the experiences and performance of Black women. Studies make it difficult to tease out the forces shaping student aspirations and outcomes in STEM, which can lead to flawed explanations that do not take in account the influence of macro forces that can structure students' pathways to degree. This study addresses these concerns by identifying and exploring the opportunities—both past and present—that facilitate the achievement of Black women undergraduate students in STEM at 10 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)#FRE#
