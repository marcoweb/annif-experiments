#ITI#Using activity theory as an analytical lens to conceptualise a framework for fostering interdisciplinary science habits in postsecondary students#FTI#
#IRE#This study presents a conceptual framework for embedding interdisciplinary learning approaches in a postsecondary science program in order to foster interdisciplinary science habits in students. The framework was developed through the lens of a multi-year interdisciplinary postsecondary science program that encompasses a series of courses in which science disciplines are bridged within an authentic science research environment. The validity of the developed framework is supported by the empirical data comprising live experiences of the students obtained through questionnaires, interviews and focus groups. The data were processed and evaluated using content analysis and activity theory. This work provides design principles that will be useful for both program developers and education researchers seeking to launch effective interdisciplinary science programs#FRE#
