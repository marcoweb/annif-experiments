#ITI#To behave or not (un)ethically? The meditative effect of mindfulness on statistics anxiety and academic dishonesty moderated by risk aversion#FTI#
#IRE#Despite the growing interest in mindfulness in higher education, the literature on its relation to decision-making under risk (i.e. academic misconduct) and statistics anxiety is scarce. The present research shall fill this gap. Based on the prospect theory, we assessed the mediating effect of mindfulness on the relationship between statistics anxiety and academic dishonesty moderated by risk aversion. Data were collected from 791 undergraduate students in six Israeli academic institutions studying for bachelor’s degrees in social sciences. Questionnaires included the following measures: risk behaviour according to the prospect theory framework, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale, Academic Misconduct Scale and sociodemographic variables. Correlations among these variables were explored. The data was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results indicate that the variance in academic dishonesty is explained by students' statistics anxiety with a mediation of Mindfulness moderated by Risk Aversion. Mindfulness negatively affects Academic Dishonesty, while Risk Aversion has a significant positive effect on Mindfulness. Finally, among individuals with high statistics anxiety, Risk Averse individuals show significantly higher Mindfulness than Risk Seekers. We conclude that mindfulness-based interventions might be a constructive tool to reduce risk-taking and promote ethical decision-making among individuals who experience high levels of statistics anxiety. Furthermore, developing mindful skills may help individuals with higher anxiety levels neutralize these unwanted feelings and get along with their learning tasks. Hence, avoid academic unethical behaviours. © The Author(s) 2024.#FRE#
