#ITI#Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) of pre-service science teachers: A Delphi study#FTI#
#IRE# Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is an emerging competence of pre-service science teachers in the 21st education century. In Indonesian context, knowledge about the use of technology to develop teachers is way too limited. Therefore, this study aimed to identify pre-service teacher competencies in integrating technology into science instruction. To achieve a consensus of the identification, this study used 30 science experts in three rounds of Delphi method. Out of the 30, 19 participated in Round One, 17 in Two, and 15 in Three. The experts were asked to answer a set of questions in 2 questionnaires in round Two and Three with anonymous identity. The result showed that the experts’ agreement promoted the four dimensions of TPACK (4 D-TPACK), which are knowledge, skill, character, and meta-learning. Moreover, most of them identified 26 important competencies which were further specified into 14 items and classified into 4 dimensions. The general pedagogical and technological knowledge were rated with a high-level of competence. Therefore, the implication of these findings is that the institution of pre-service science teachers that integrates technology needs to involve 4 D-TPACK and adopt the significant item of competencies to enhance the program#FRE#
