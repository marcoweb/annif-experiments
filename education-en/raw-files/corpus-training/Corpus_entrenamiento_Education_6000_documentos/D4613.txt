#ITI#Academic integrity and copyright literacy policy and instruction in K-12 schools: a global study from the perspective of school library professionals#FTI#
#IRE#This study examined the policies and instructional practices related to academic integrity and copyright literacy in K-12 schools through the lens of school library professionals. Since school librarians play a key role in promoting academic integrity and copyright literacy in schools, they were chosen. An online survey was administered to school library professionals in 85 countries using a mixed methods approach, yielding 569 responses. The results revealed that many K-12 schools lack policies on academic integrity and copyright, and there is variability in the perceived value, implementation and teaching of these literacies. While most school library professionals reported teaching academic integrity and copyright literacy in their schools, implementing effective pedagogies remains challenging. Collaboration between school library professionals and teachers, along with the use of multimedia resources, were identified as potential strategies for practical education and instruction. The study highlights the need for greater attention to be given to these literacies in K-12 education and calls for the development of policies, necessary support and effective teaching methods to ensure students are knowledgeable and well-prepared for higher education. © The Author(s) 2024.#FRE#
