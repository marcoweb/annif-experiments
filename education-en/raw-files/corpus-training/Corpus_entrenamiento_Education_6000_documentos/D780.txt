#ITI#Clinical educators can supervise students without increased stress: a study of interacting factors using insights from complexity theory#FTI#
#IRE# Supervising students in healthcare settings is complex and can be stressful for clinical educators. However, it is unclear how to design student placements without clinical educator stress. Using complexity theory as a lens, fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) was used to explore factors associated with no increased stress for clinical educators during speech pathology (SP) placements. Factor selection was informed by the Demand- Control- Support model and existing literature. No single factor was necessary for clinical educators to experience no increased stress. Varied combinations of all factors were found in 10 paths to no increased stress. These combinations often had passing student(s); however, multiple paths included other factors that could be adjusted by clinical educators prior to placement. For example, having more than one workday per week without students was a factor in four paths to no increased stress despite other potential challenges such as a higher caseload throughput. More experienced educators, who had other supporting factors (e.g. lower caseload throughput or workplace engagement such as support from colleagues and managers), also perceived no increased stress in four paths. Student placements without increased stress for clinical educators require consideration of multiple interacting factors. Principles of complexity theory provide insight into how clinical educators uniquely respond to their individual circumstances, resulting in different experiences of student placement impact even within similar workplaces. FsQCA has highlighted practical ways clinical educators supervise students without increased stress. However, any changes for an individual clinical educator need to be considered in combination with other factors given the complexity of clinical education and healthcare settings#FRE#
