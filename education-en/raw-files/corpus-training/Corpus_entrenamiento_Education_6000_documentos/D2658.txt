#ITI#Effects of virtual reality on creativity performance and perceived immersion: A study of brain waves#FTI#
#IRE# The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of virtual reality (VR) application on creative performance and immersion, evaluated through electroencephalography brain wave data to achieve accurate and robust results. In this study, 72 middle school teachers were recruited as participants, and a non-randomized control-group pre-test–post-test design was employed. The experimental group received VR-based design instruction, and the control group received lecture-based design training. Our results revealed that VR significantly affects immersion, especially with regard to attention. Additionally, VR had a positive effect on the feasibility of the creative process, although its effects on variety and novelty were inconclusive. VR was significantly correlated with theta, beta, and gamma brain wave activity. VR also increased attention-related and meditation-related brain wave activity and desynchronized alpha waves. Practitioner notes: What is already known about this topic VR is used in many areas. VR in education is getting more important day after day. What this paper adds VR significantly affects immersion, especially with regard to attention. VR had a positive effect on the feasibility of the creative process, although its effects on variety and novelty were inconclusive. VR was significantly correlated with theta, beta, and gamma brain wave activity. VR also increased attention-related and meditation-related brain wave activity and desynchronized alpha waves. Implications for practice and/or policy User lack of familiarity with VR may also have influenced the results; more VR learning materials should be provided for learners. In addition to using a larger sample, future studies should focus on creative novelty when developing VR content to improve creative processes and outcomes. Familiarizing learners with the use of VR could effectively reduce the cognitive load, as well as contribute to the stimulation of creative brain waves#FRE#
