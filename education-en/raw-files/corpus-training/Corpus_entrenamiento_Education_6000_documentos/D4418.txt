#ITI#Michael Duane and Risinghill School: rebel with a cause?#FTI#
#IRE#Risinghill School was one of a new type of secondary school, called a ‘comprehensive’, which opened in Islington, north London, in 1960, under the headship of Michael Duane. He had a cause: a clear view as to the style of school that he wished to create: it was one that was progressive, democratic and inclusive: for him, the true essence of a comprehensive school. His five-year tenure as head of the school was fraught with problems, however. This paper explores the idea of Duane as a rebel against the political and educational establishment and the extent to which there was very limited support for his cause from it. Despite the school having had successes, it was closed after just five years and Duane was never successful afterwards in acquiring another headteacher post#FRE#
