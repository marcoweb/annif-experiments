#ITI#Relationship between team learning profiles and outcomes in team project-based learning: a cluster analysis#FTI#
#IRE# Team project-based learning has become increasingly common in higher education. This study aimed to characterise and understand students’ team learning experiences in team project-based learning by considering various aspects, such as individual qualities, teamwork, task, and instructor support. K-means clustering analysis was performed using eleven variables: team learning preference, co-regulation, team efficacy, team climate, team trust, psychological safety, team interaction, perceived team loafing, task authenticity, the frequency of instructor feedback, and usefulness of instructor feedback. Data were collected from students who were involved in team project-based learning at a South Korean university in the 2nd semester of 2021, and 782 responses were used in the analysis. Consequently, six clusters were identified, each showing different patterns of individual team learning attitudes and skills, teamwork, task authenticity, and instructor feedback. Following the cluster analysis, one-way ANOVA was performed, finding significant differences in team performance and team learning satisfaction between clusters. Based on these findings, important factors in team learning are discussed, and implications of enhancing team project-based learning are presented#FRE#
