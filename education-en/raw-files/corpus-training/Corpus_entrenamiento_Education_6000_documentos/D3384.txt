#ITI#Global citizenship as a virtue for the Anthropocene: philosophical and educational perspective#FTI#
#IRE#In this paper, I present the concept of global citizenship from the perspective of virtue theory, namely as a disposition to do the right thing, for the right reason and in the right way. The paper consists of two parts. In the first part, I show that global citizenship is a virtue that is needed to respond in the right way to the challenges that Anthropocenians meet. In the second part, I focus on the possibility of including the virtue of global citizenship in global education. I present arguments for including virtues in global education programmes and an example of a successful virtue education programme in Australia#FRE#
