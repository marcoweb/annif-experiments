#ITI#Positive education: A new look at Freedom to Learn#FTI#
#IRE#Recent years have seen much interest in positive education. In this article, we will show how person-centred education, like positive education, is concerned with the promotion of human flourishing. Both offer ways in which education goes beyond traditional skills and knowledge to a concern for the well-being of people. However, we argue that an awareness of the scholarship of Carl Rogers, the author of Freedom to Learn and the originator of the person-centred approach with its contrasting ontological stance to human nature will broaden the scope of the positive education movement to create a healthy and necessary theoretical tension in views of how positive education can be delivered#FRE#
