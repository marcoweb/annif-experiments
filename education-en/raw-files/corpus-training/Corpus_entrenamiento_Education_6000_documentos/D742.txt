#ITI#Challenges to delivering university health-based work-integrated learning to students with a disability: a scoping review#FTI#
#IRE# Students with disability experience numerous challenges when engaging in Work-Integrated Learning (WIL). Successful WIL requires stakeholder collaboration to provide an equitable and relevant WIL experience. Stakeholder disparity around disclosure, accommodations, poor attitudes, and behaviours result in negative WIL experiences for students with disability. Understanding stakeholder preparedness and capabilities, in particular host organisations, is key to providing equitable WIL opportunities. Searches of five electronic databases (CINAHL, PubMed, Embase/Scopus, A + Education Informit and Web of Science) were conducted. Twenty-one peer-reviewed articles published between 2005 and 2022 were included in the review. Four themes were identified: Disclosure of the disability; University staff and WIL supervisor attitudes and training; Surviving WIL and Adjusting WIL to the individual. Embedding a strengths-based approach to WIL through strong relationships between student, host organisation and university will produce safe environments that are essential for high quality and fit for purpose WIL experiences for students with disability#FRE#
