#ITI#The change in reactions of preschool children to physical disability: a parent-Supported intervention#FTI#
#IRE#This study aims to investigate the change in reactions to physical disability among typically developing preschool children who were informed by their parents about children with physical disabilities. 18 children (8 males and 10 females) attending the same class in a kindergarten, their parents (18) and a teacher participated in the study. During the intervention process, typically developing preschool children were informed about children with physical disabilities via videos by their parents. Data were collected via an interview form designed for attitudes of typically developing children towards children with physical disabilities (before and after the intervention), as well as follow-up parent and teacher interviews. Content analysis method was used to interpret the data. Results indicated positive changes in the attitudes of typically developing preschool children towards physical disability. The parent-teacher interviews showed that typically developing children had more awareness, empathy and sensitivity towards their peers with physical disabilities#FRE#
