#ITI#The phantom that haunts us (again): post-fascism, affect, and the paradoxes of cultivating an anti-fascist sensibility in education#FTI#
#IRE#This article engages with the notion of ‘post-fascism’ in contemporary times, and explores how attention to the affective ideology of post-fascism can inform pedagogical thinking that cultivates an anti-fascist sensibility in education. It is argued that to do so, it is necessary to somehow break fascism’s grip on the body and its affective pull. The analysis offered in this paper enables a critical interrogation of how the education field itself may be implicated to the cultivation of ‘fascist traits’ by being complicit to the structures and practices that are connected to neo-fascism such as neo-liberal globalisation. Despite the paradoxes entailed in education’s efforts to cultivate an anti-fascist sensibility, educators have a lot to gain from interrogating their own complicity and especially how they can engage with their students in anti-complicit actions that challenge fascist structures and practices in education#FRE#
