#ITI#Preparing physical education teachers for the inclusions of children with disabilities through online courses: A scoping review#FTI#
#IRE#The inclusion of children with disabilities in physical education (PE) classes is of the utmost importance and is addressed in teacher training programmes through a range of courses, aimed at providing teachers with knowledge and tools for enhancing inclusion in their PE classes. This paper provides a scoping review of research papers on such courses that are conducted online. The search was conducted through Google Scholar, Sport Discus (via EBSCO Host), and PubMed databases, using two search term clusters: population and subject matter and teaching. Eight articles were then assessed according to participants, programme content and procedures, methodology and instruments, and outcomes and discussion. Four studies provide comparative online/face-to-face courses data between participants. One applied a mixed methods design, three were quantitative, and four were qualitative studies. Most of the findings indicate participant satisfaction with online courses on inclusive PE classes, with scores of knowledge and self-efficacy regarding such inclusion being similar to those seen in face-to-face courses. However, some studies lacked important background variables, such as gender and previous experience working with people with disabilities. The findings of this scoping review highlight several directions for future exploration of such online courses#FRE#
