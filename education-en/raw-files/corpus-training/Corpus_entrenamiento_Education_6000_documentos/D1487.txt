#ITI#Intervening with near-future possible L2 selves: EFL students as peer-to-peer motivating agents during Exploratory Practice#FTI#
#IRE# The present study offers insights on understanding motivation to learn a second language (L2) through implementation of the Exploratory Practice principles within the context of English as a foreign language at a university in Spain, and on discovering opportunities to enhance this. The account sits within the domain of the possible selves and the theoretical framework of the L2 Motivational Self System. Student-led visualisation – a twist on teacher-led visualisation – is the key ‘Potentially Exploitable Pedagogic Activity’ (PEPA), explored as a device for inviting a near-future L2 self-guide into the here-and-now. This PEPA evolved out of stages of understanding, including student dismissal as ‘fantasies’ their possible professional L2 selves in a remoter future. Through classroom observation, template analysis of imagery scripts, and student oral and written feedback, the present study finds that the students demonstrated motivated L2 behaviour in group writing about the near-future ideal L2 self and in introducing this self-guide to their peers, who were moved by and found plausible the stories they heard.#FRE#
