#ITI#Academic self-concept, perceptions of inclusion, special needs and gender: evidence from inclusive classes in Sweden#FTI#
#IRE#Even in inclusive classroom, children with special education needs (SEN) have been shown to have lower levels of emotional inclusion and academic self-concept. Although, their social inclusion may be comparable to their peers. At the same time, boys and girls may also experience differences in perceptions of inclusion and academic self-concept. Newly developed reliably short-ratings of these three variables (i.e. the Perception of Inclusion Questionnaire; PIQ) may offer an insight into developmental patterns for children with and without SEN in relation to perception of inclusion and academic self-concept. In this study, the PIQ is validated in a new setting and language group by looking at Swedish fifth and eighth graders in an inclusive school. Different levels of academic self-concept and emotional inclusion are found for children with SEN. Meanwhile eight-grade girls showed a lower self-concept in comparison to fifth-grade girls and to boys of either grade. Additionally, girls with SEN showed a higher level of academic self-concept than boys did in comparison to their same-sex peers without SEN#FRE#
