#ITI#Transforming the future of quantitative educational research: a systematic review of enacting quantCrit#FTI#
#IRE# Quantitative Critical Race Theory (QuantCrit) is a burgeoning field of study seeking to challenge and improve the use of statistical data in social research. It pulls lessons and insights from Critical Race Theory and applies them to understanding social challenges. In this paper, we aim to improve the quality of quantitative research produced by showing examples of how pioneers in this field are effectively enacting QuantCrit. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to include all empirical education studies published since 2010 through 2022. Twenty-seven studies fit the criteria. Our data shows there is room for innovation, experimentation, and exploration. However, the study highlights exemplars of authors who embody QuantCrit principles through their professional and personal positionality statements, cognizance of community, robust racial/ethnic categories, intentionality on not centering whiteness, use of atypical methods, new measurement tools centering Black and Brown students, and innovative interpretations of findings#FRE#
