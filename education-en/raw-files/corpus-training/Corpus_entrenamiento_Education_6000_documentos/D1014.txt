#ITI#Development and validation of the peer assessment motivation scale (PAMS) in higher education#FTI#
#IRE# Measurement of students’ peer assessment motivation is critical to understand how they participate in such activities in higher education. The current study was conducted to develop and validate a brief scale that measures student peer assessment motivation in higher education using the Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT). Initial items were developed, revised, and administered to 369 students. Exploratory factor analyses suggested a three-factor model structure (ability belief, expectancy, and task value) aligning with EVT. Confirmatory factor analyses (n = 399) supported a higher-order factor structure with the three first-order factors (i.e. ability belief, expectancy, and task value) with a decent model fit. The 20-items Peer Assessment Motivation Scale (PAMS) had decent internal reliability, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity, suggesting that it is a high-quality measure. This scale is beneficial for instructors and researchers who are interested in investigating peer assessment motivation in higher education#FRE#
