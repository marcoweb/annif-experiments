#ITI#Improving student learning through inquiry-based reading#FTI#
#IRE#Based on qualitative data on students’ approach to reading this paper argues that student learning be significantly improved by facilitating reading to unfold as a method of inquiry. Identifying how students currently orient and interact with texts and further what learning outcomes reading affords we develop the concept of ‘Text-Centred Reading’ (TCR), which contrasts models such as inquiry-based-learning. TCR differs from established concepts in the literature, emphasizing that the interest orienting the reader’s focus is decisive for her learning. In paraphrasing the model of ‘Teacher-centered-teaching’, the concept criticizes the prevailing framing of reading in higher education as outmoded. Drawing on an earlier study of how researchers read and learn through reading, we discuss how students’ learning can improve if reading is taught and supported as a method of inquiry. Finally we suggest that in confronting specific challenges related to this endeavor inspiration can be drawn from ‘Inquiry-Based Learning’ (IBL) frameworks#FRE#
