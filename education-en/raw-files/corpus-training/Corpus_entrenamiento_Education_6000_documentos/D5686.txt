#ITI#Special education in Norwegian early childhood education and care: a document analysis of special education assistance provided to children with language disorders#FTI#
#IRE#This study aims to investigate the characteristics of special educational assistance provided to children with language disorders (LDs) attending ordinary early childhood education and care institutions (ECECs) in Norway, with a focus on objectives for language development and language interventions. An in-depth document analysis of 71 pedagogical documents, such as expert assessments and individual development plans (IDPs), pertaining to four children with LDs was conducted. These documents play a large part in the documentation of the special education provision and were analysed and categorised in line with a hermeneutical approach. The findings show that the objectives and the language interventions recommended by the Educational Psychological Service (EPS) in the expert assessments are general or missing, and the language interventions recommended were seldom tailored to the children’s LDs. This propagates further among the IDPs. The findings further suggest a division in the responsibilities between the different institutions, with the result that the provision given to the children appears fragmented. Finally, the analysed documents reveal a variation in the quality recommended in special education assistance, which implies a need for improvement in both organisation and competence at ECECs and EPS, to be able to provide an integrated practice#FRE#
