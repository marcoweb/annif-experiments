#ITI#Effect of Best Possible Self Writing Activities on Preservice Teachers' Attitudes towards Technology Integration#FTI#
#IRE#Preservice teachers’ attitudes towards technology integration influence their motivation for and future behavior in teaching, but effective interventions to modify attitudes towards technology integration are scarce in teacher education programs. This quasi-experimental study redesigned and integrated one of the most widely used positive psychology interventions—Best Possible Self (BPS)—for use in a stand-alone technology integration course to measure its effect in improving preservice teachers’ attitudes towards technology integration. While results show no statistically significant difference between the control and treatment groups, the treatment group had more positive trends (significant increase in positive attitudes) than the control group (no significant increase in positive attitudes) even under the negative influence of pandemic. The results of this study suggest a need for continued development of and research on this type of activity#FRE#
