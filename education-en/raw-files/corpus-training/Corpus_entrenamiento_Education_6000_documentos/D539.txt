#ITI#Do Charter Schools Worsen Conditions in Neighborhood Public Schools? An Analysis of School Safety in New York City#FTI#
#IRE# Safety has contributed to the growth of charter schools. However, charter schools may drain public schools of key resources, leading to a decline in safety in public schools. This study examines whether the opening of charter schools in New York City is associated with decreased safety in public schools. Results indicate very little or no difference in violent and non-violent offenses for public schools co-locating with charter schools and those within a quarter-mile and a half-mile of new charter schools. Charter schools in New York City may provide safer options without having a negative influence on safety in public schools.#FRE#
