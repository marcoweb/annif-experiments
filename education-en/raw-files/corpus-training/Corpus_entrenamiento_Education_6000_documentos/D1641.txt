#ITI#Formation of academic self-concept and intrinsic value within and across three domains: Extending the reciprocal internal/external frame of reference model#FTI#
#IRE# Background: The reciprocal internal/external frame of reference (RI/E) combines two models of academic self-concept formation, namely the reciprocal effects model (REM) and the internal/external frame of reference (I/E) model. The REM assumes reciprocal relations between achievement and academic self-concept. The I/E model assumes contrast effects between achievement and self-concept across math and verbal domains. The RI/E model can be extended to more school subjects than one math and one verbal domain, and to other motivational constructs. Aims: We examined an extended RI/E model considering achievement, academic self-concept, and intrinsic value related to math, German and English. Sample: The sample consisted of 1939 German secondary school students. Methods: The three measurement waves covered Grades 5 to 7. Cross-lagged panel models were used to analyse the data. Results: Within domains, there were reciprocal relations between achievement and academic self-concept but only unidirectional relations between former achievements and later intrinsic values. Across domains, there were significant negative relations between former math achievement and later self-concepts and intrinsic values in German and English, and between former German and English achievements and later self-concept and intrinsic value in math. These findings imply contrast effects across math and verbal domains. The pattern of relations among constructs was found to be generalizable across gender and school tracks and stable across measurement waves. Conclusion: The study provides further support for the validity of the RI/E model and its extension to English as another school subject and intrinsic value as another motivational construct#FRE#
