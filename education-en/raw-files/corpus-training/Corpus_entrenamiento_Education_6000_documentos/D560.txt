#ITI#Charter School Regulation as a Disproportionate Barrier to Entry#FTI#
#IRE# In response to concerns regarding school quality, state policy-makers reformed their charter school authorization processes to impose greater regulatory barriers to chartering. These barriers to market entry could impose substantial burdens for Black and Latino would-be charter operators, as well as independent operators, who may lack access to social and financial capital. We test these hypotheses by comparing application outcomes from states with high and low levels of charter regulation, as measured by the National Association of Charter School Authorizers. Empirical analyses indicate that independent and Black and Latino applicants are disproportionately and negatively impacted by increasing regulation.#FRE#
