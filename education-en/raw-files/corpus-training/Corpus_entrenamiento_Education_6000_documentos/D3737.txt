#ITI#Housing conditions and psychological distress among higher education students: a systematic literature review#FTI#
#IRE#Housing has been identified as one of the most important areas related to individual well-being in emerging adults attending a tertiary educational institution. Thus, the purpose of this systematic review is to explore the relationship between students’ housing conditions and students’ psychical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Outcomes were categorised into 10 categories: 1. homesickness and adaptation to college life; 2. overall health and distress; 3. sleep; 4. depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions; 5. alcohol abuse; 6. substance abuse; 7. tobacco use; 8. internet addiction; 9. eating disorders; and 10. sexual behaviours. Student housing conditions play an important role in a variety of health and health-related problems. These findings underscore the relationship between housing conditions and different facets of students’ mental and physical wellbeing, emphasising the importance of addressing housing conditions in mental health prevention and intervention programmes#FRE#
