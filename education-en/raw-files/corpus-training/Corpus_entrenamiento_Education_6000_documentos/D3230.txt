#ITI#Teacher and School Concerns and Actions on Elementary School Children Digital Safety#FTI#
#IRE#Elementary school children are spending more time using digital technologies. Teachers and schools are concerned about the student’s digital safety. We interviewed ten elementary school teachers virtually to understand their concerns and understand the actions they take regarding elementary school children’s digital safety. Using thematic analysis, we identified themes of concerns and actions of teachers and schools on elementary school children’s digital safety. Some digital safety concerns discussed by the teachers included content-related concerns such as accessing inappropriate content, contact-related concerns, inappropriate contact with others online, sharing personal information, lack of understanding of danger, conduct-related concerns regarding cyberbullying and digital footprint, contract-related concerns such as digital security and privacy, and home-related concerns. Teachers and schools have taken several actions to address these concerns. Some of the digital safety actions included security measures and limits, monitoring student activities, providing education on digital safety, and support from guidance counselors. This study has implications for elementary school educators, administrators, parents, and students on the safe use of digital technologies#FRE#
