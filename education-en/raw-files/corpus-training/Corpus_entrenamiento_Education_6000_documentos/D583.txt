#ITI#Accountability from the Ground Up: Uncovering the Limitations and Possibilities of Organizing for Community Schools in Philadelphia#FTI#
#IRE# This paper focuses on the evolution of community schools from a grassroots organizing effort to a formal initiative in Philadelphia. The authors implemented a critical participatory action research project to examine the process and impact of the education organizing. We present two narratives to illustrate the potential and limitations of two divergent community school approaches. We argue that education justice movements must develop processes and metrics of accountability to effectively organize for transformative community-driven education. Findings provide insights to communities organizing for public education in other contexts and locales and an example of how research can support social justice movements.#FRE#
