#ITI#Interactions of trait emotional intelligence, foreign language anxiety, and foreign language enjoyment in the foreign language speaking classroom#FTI#
#IRE#The present study investigated the interactions of trait emotional intelligence (trait EI), foreign language anxiety (FLA), and foreign language enjoyment (FLE) in the foreign language speaking classroom. Data collected from 274 Chinese postgraduate EFL learners showed that the subjects generally had medium to high scores on global trait EI; in terms of the four trait EI factors, they scored relatively high on emotionality and well-being, followed in turn by self-control and sociability. They had high mean levels of FLE and moderate to high mean levels of FLA. Significant small to medium correlations were found between trait EI, FLE, and FLA. Regressions revealed that trait EI was a stronger predictor of FLA than of FLE. Trait EI played a fundamental role in its significant interactions with FLA and FLE. In addition, well-being and emotionality figured significantly to both FLE and FLA, while sociability only significantly predicted FLA. High levels of self-control hindered the effect of other significant factors. It is implied that fostering learners’ trait EI can potentially boost FLE and alleviate FLA. The findings also offer suggestions for the development of EI-based intervention programmes#FRE#
