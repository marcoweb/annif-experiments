#ITI#A Recent History of Learning Design and Technology#FTI#
#IRE#The history of the learning design and technology field for the length of the twentieth century is well documented, however, events after the year 2000, even our lived histories, are missing from important timelines and discussions. This article is an attempt to describe the history of events in the educational technology and research field from the start of the twenty-first century to the global COVD-19 Pandemic. This historical overview reflects on these events and their significance to the field’s identity and future#FRE#
