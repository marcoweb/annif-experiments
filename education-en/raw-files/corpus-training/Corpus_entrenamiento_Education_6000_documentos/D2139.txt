#ITI#Teaching with robotics: creating and implementing integrated units in middle school subjects#FTI#
#IRE# Robotics activities engage students in critical and computational thinking, problem solving, and collaboration, as well as engineering and computer science. By integrating robotics into disciplinary courses, educators offer these opportunities to a wider range of students. However, teachers may be less likely to use new technology without evidence that it can support their teaching and student learning. This paper presents two descriptive case studies as a ‘proof of concept’ for integrating robotics construction activities into disciplinary courses. They focus on teachers’ motivation for integration, and how they used robotics to support disciplinary goals#FRE#
