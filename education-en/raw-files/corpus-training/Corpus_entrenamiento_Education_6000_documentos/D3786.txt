#ITI#A Scoping Review of Quality in Early Childhood Publicly-Funded Programs#FTI#
#IRE#Defining quality in early learning and child care (ELCC) settings is complex. With an increased emphasis on universal ELCC systems to support greater access for families, research is needed to provide clarity on the concepts that contribute to high-quality programs. In this scoping review, 41 literature sources met our criteria (of a possible 6335) to determine what is known about high-quality early childhood programming in publicly-funded, school-based settings using a systems framework. Using a thematic analysis and consistent with a systems lens, our results suggest an overarching influence from system-level policies that intersect with practice, people and place within early childhood education and care#FRE#
