#ITI#Access and participation: The use of technologies as tools for inclusion by Spanish university lecturers#FTI#
#IRE#Spanish face-to-face universities experience constant challenges that threaten the inclusion of students with disabilities. Adopting inclusive pedagogies can support universities to develop a more inclusive approach. This paper explores the extent to which the use of technology influences the inclusive pedagogies of Spanish university lecturers. In particular, we focus on how lecturers use technologies to promote student participation and accessibility in Spanish institution. A qualitative methodology involving semi-structured in-depth interviews with 42 Spanish university lecturers regarding their inclusive practices and use of technology was employed. The results contribute four fundamental findings: (a) Lecturers who practise inclusive pedagogy can be differentiated as proactive or reactive; (b) University lecturers place greater emphasis on the use of technology as a promoter of accessibility rather than as a tool to promote participation; (c) There is a disconnect between knowledge of universal design for learning and the use of the technologies; and (d) The full transformative potential of technologies to facilitate the inclusion of learners with disabilities is not being harnessed. All these results allow us to highlight some key points about the use of technological tools in the application of inclusive pedagogy in university classrooms. © (2024) Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
