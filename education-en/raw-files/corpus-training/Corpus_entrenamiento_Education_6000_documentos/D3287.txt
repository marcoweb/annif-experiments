#ITI#Analysing the Community of Inquiry Model in the Context of Online Learning: A Bibliometric Study#FTI#
#IRE#This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of the community of inquiry model in online learning. The study focuses on identifying the most trending topics, most impact authors, most relevant sources, most relevant countries and most cited articles in the community of inquiry online learning model. Another aim is to understand the literature's factorial analysis, co-occurrence mapping and productivity mapping and the importance of the community of inquiry model in online teaching and learning. A total of 405 studies published between 2015 and 2022 extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection for the study. The results show the extent of growth of research studies in the community of inquiry model. The analysis revealed trends of productive authors and journals, and also identified the top country in terms of publishing articles. It includes a deeper understanding of the intellectual structure and conceptual evolution of the CoI model. Future research should explore advanced bibliometric mapping for CoI dynamics and the factors influencing learner engagement within the community of inquiry model, the role of teaching, cognitive and social presences, and strategies to strengthen the three presences in online learning. The study will help educators and researchers to identify the trends in relation to the community of inquiry framework. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2024.#FRE#
