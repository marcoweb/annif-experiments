#ITI#Designing Game-Based Learning for High School Artificial Intelligence Education#FTI#
#IRE# Artificial Intelligence (AI) permeates every aspect of our daily lives and is no longer a subject reserved for a select few in higher education but is essential knowledge that our youth need for the future. Much is unknown about the level of AI knowledge that is age and developmentally appropriate for high school, let alone about how to teach AI to even younger learners. In this theoretical paper, we discuss the design of a game-based learning environment for high school AI education, drawing upon insights gained from a prior cognitive interview study at a STEM focused private high school. We argue that game-based learning is an excellent fit for AI education due to the commonality of problem solving in both game playing and AI#FRE#
