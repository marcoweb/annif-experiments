#ITI#How workplace learning is put into practice: contrasting the medical and nursing contexts from the perspective of teaching and learning regimes#FTI#
#IRE# Health professions education places significant emphasis on learning in the clinical environment. While experiences of workplace learning have been extensively investigated, practices of workplace learning explored through field work have been less utilized. The theoretical framework of teaching and learning regimes acknowledges aspects of power and conflict in its consideration of what guides teachers and learners in their practice of workplace learning. This study aimed to explore practices of workplace learning in the two adjacent healthcare professions; medicine and nursing. We adopted an ethnographic qualitative design. Field observations and follow-up interviews were performed in three clinical departments and the data set comprised 12 full days of observations and 16 formal follow-up interviews. Thematic analysis was performed deductively according to the theoretical framework. Four teaching and learning regimes were found in the data. In the medical context, workplace learning was either practiced as reproduction of current practice or through stimulation of professional development. In the nursing context, workplace learning was either based on development of partnership between student and supervisor or on conditional membership in a professional community. The medical and nursing contexts demonstrated varying underpinnings and assumptions relating to teaching and learning. The respective practices of workplace learning in the medical and nursing context appear to hold substantial differences which might have implications for how we understand practices of workplace learning. We further conclude that the theoretical framework of teaching and learning regimes in this study proved useful in exploring workplace learning#FRE#
