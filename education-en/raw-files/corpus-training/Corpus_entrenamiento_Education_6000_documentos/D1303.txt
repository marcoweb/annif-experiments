#ITI#Role of organisational readiness and stakeholder acceptance: an implementation framework of adaptive learning for higher education#FTI#
#IRE# Despite its advantages and potentials, the extent of the implementation of adaptive learning remains limited. Recent studies identified the critical determinants associated with its scaled implementation and proposed various frameworks and strategies to support it. However, little has been done to identify the empirical relationships between such determinants, the strategies for addressing them, and a scaled implementation as the desired outcome. Identifying such relationships can however help elucidate the processes involved in the implementation process of adaptive learning and, therefore, better explain the reasons for its slow implementation. The current study aims to identify the relationships between critical factors associated with the successful implementation of adaptive learning, strategies that address such factors, and the desired outcomes. Based on the identified relationships, the study presents an empirically supported implementation framework for adaptive learning. We used the secondary analysis of qualitative data, which were previously collected from 51 participants in an international Delphi study conducted in two universities in Switzerland and South Africa. For coding, we used inductive coding techniques suitable for identifying connections (e.g., causal relationships) between the identified factors. We conclude by turning the attention of implementation researchers and educational leaders to the key role of organisational readiness and the stakeholder acceptance of adaptive learning during the implementation process#FRE#
