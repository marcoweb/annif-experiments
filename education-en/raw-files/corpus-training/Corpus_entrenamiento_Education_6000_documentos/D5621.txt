#ITI#Innovative interventions and provisions of accommodations to students with disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#The literature on the inclusion of students with disabilities in the university setting highlights the great importance of the faculty’s willingness to provide quality accommodations. However, current studies offer only an initial analysis of the factors explaining these accommodations. Current research requires the analysis of new actions that will improve the accommodations provided by the university faculty. The objective of this study is to research the effect that innovative programmes and interventions have on the provision of accommodations to university students with disabilities. Using structured questionnaire, sample of 182 university professors, and structural equation model, the results indicate that innovative programs and interventions have a significant influence on the provision of accommodations by improving both personal beliefs regarding students with disabilities and the professors’ perception of institutional support. Suggestions are proposed for implementing strategies to implant intervention programs that will improve the faculty’s willingness to provide accommodations and support to students with disabilities#FRE#
