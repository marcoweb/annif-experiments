#ITI#Multi-disciplinary staff perspectives and consensus on e-Learning and mHealth for Health Sciences curricula#FTI#
#IRE# Health systems face complex challenges–even more so in resource-constrained contexts such as South Africa. Alignment of local educational systems with national development goals is needed to strengthen health systems. The further disruption of COVID-19 to educational and health systems underscores the necessity to adapt our curricula and practices. Integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), such as e-Learning and mobile health (mHealth) applications integrated with learning management systems, or virtual learning environments, offer a sustainable strategy for the enhancement of Health Science student training, graduate competency development and delivery of quality patient care. Uptake, or not, of e-Learning and mHealth at several South African universities was explored through a survey with staff (n = 65) from across the Health Sciences. Diverse perceptions, experiences and recommendations were found, including the prevalence and dis/advantages of e-Learning and mHealth in the Health Sciences. The perceived usefulness of specific features of each were highlighted. In closing, a multi-modal model of epistemology, axiology and ontology in healthcare technology, digital health and medical education–including content, skills, technology development and challenges/constraints–is presented#FRE#
