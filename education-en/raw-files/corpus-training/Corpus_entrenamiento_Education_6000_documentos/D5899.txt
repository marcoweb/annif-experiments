#ITI#Beliefs and engagement in an institution-wide pedagogic shift#FTI#
#IRE#This study addresses the attitudes of academic staff towards a large-scale pedagogic shift to Active Blended Learning (ABL). Beliefs about the shift and how it is translated into practice are explored. Four main categories are derived: ‘Active Innovators’ who believe change is positive and apply it to their academic practice; ‘Lagging Innovators’ who hold positive beliefs but fail to fully implement it; ‘Sceptical but obliging’ who hold negative beliefs but whose practices are consistent with the new approach; and ‘Sceptical and resistant’ who hold negative beliefs about ABL and actively resist implementing it in their practice. This article suggests that institutions aiming to promote large-scale sustainable change, may approach the process through two routes: (1) a pragmatic route, focused on promoting change in practice (i.e. practice generates subsequent changes to beliefs); and (2) an epistemic route, aimed at promoting changes to beliefs (i.e. beliefs change first, practices follow)#FRE#
