#ITI#An online laboratory applications course for the development of scientific practices and scientific method#FTI#
#IRE#The reform documents point out the necessity of teaching the plurality of scientific method (SM) when scientists engage in scientific practices (SPs). The dramatic change in education due to Covid-19 pandemic necessitates examining the outcomes of online education, especially laboratory applications courses, which the students and educators used to face-to-face instruction by using real-life equipment and materials in the laboratory. The current study investigated pre-service science teachers’ (PSSTs’) understanding of SPs and SM as well as their incorporation of these elements into their teaching before and after an online course. Pre- and post-reflections of SPs and SM were used to explore their understanding, while video-recordings and laboratory teaching reports of their simulated teaching were utilised to analyse their incorporation of these elements into their own instruction. The analysis of data indicated a significant increase in PSSTs’ understanding and incorporation of SPs and SM as well as manipulative and non-manipulative investigations, non-algorithmic rationality, and different ways of gathering evidence. However, online implementation of laboratory applications course did not seem to have had an impact on their understanding of plurality of scientific methods and descriptive or experimental methods in science. Concluding remarks are made for further implications of laboratory applications course after pandemic#FRE#
