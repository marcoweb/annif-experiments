#ITI#Impact of neuromuscular training including balance, strength and plyometric exercises on static and dynamic balance in high-level male runners with mild intellectual disability#FTI#
#IRE#Background: This study aims to investigate the impact of neuromuscular training (NMT) on static and dynamic postural balance (PB) among high-level male runners with intellectual disability. Method: Twenty-seven runners were randomly assigned to a NMT group and a control group who maintained their conventional training. Static and dynamic PB were assessed using the centre of pressure (CoP) excursions (in bipedal and unipedal stances under open eyes (OE) and closed eyes (CE) conditions) and the star excursion balance test (SEBT), respectively, at pre-training and post-training. Results: The NMT group showed significantly (p < 0.05) decreased CoP values and increased SEBT scores at post-training compared to pre-training. The switch from OE to CE did not affect static PB in the bipedal stance, only in the NMT group. Conclusions: The NMT was effective in improving static and dynamic PB in runners with intellectual disability. The NMT could reduce visual dependency#FRE#
