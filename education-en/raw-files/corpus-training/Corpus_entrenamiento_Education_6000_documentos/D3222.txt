#ITI#Case-Based Learning: Consider and Reflect Teaching Practices through Teacher Moments#FTI#
#IRE#In this single case study, we explored how seven preservice teachers engaged emotionally and cognitively in case-based learning through three Teacher Moments cases to consider and reflect on their teaching practices. A thematic analysis of the transcripts of online case simulation (Teacher Moments) entries, class recordings, questionnaires and interviews suggest that preservice teachers can apply their learning, learn through diverse perspectives, and build a community through case-based learning. Educational faculty members may consider implementing case-based learning through Teacher Moments as an instructional strategy to engage preservice teachers in field experiences online#FRE#
