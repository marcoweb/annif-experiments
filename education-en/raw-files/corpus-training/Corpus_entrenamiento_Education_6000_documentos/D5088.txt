#ITI#The ideologies of Mandarin Excellence in UK news reports#FTI#
#IRE#This paper focuses on British news reports on the Mandarin Excellence Programme carried out in England by educational institutions at various levels. This research systematically examines the ways in which the learning and teaching of Mandarin Chinese is portrayed as important in English secondary schools due to globalisation and economic demands and, on a more personal level, owing to future career opportunities and the success of the British people in news discourse. The ideologies embedded in these news stories are explored, and the modalities of representing and communicating information through both written language and images are discusses (Van Dijk, T. A. 1988. News Analysis. Case Studies of International and National News in the Press. New Jersey: Lawrence, Van Dijk, T. A. 2005. “Discourse Analysis as Ideology Analysis.” In Language & Peace, 41–58. Routledge, Van Dijk, T. A. 2013. News as Discourse. Routledge; Fairclough, N. 1995. Media Discourse. London: Edward Arnold. pp. 9–14; Blommaert, J. 2005. Discourse: A Critical Introduction. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Kress, G. R., and T. Van Leeuwen. 1996. Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design. Psychology Press, Kress, G., and T. Van Leeuwen. 2001. Multimodal Discourse: The Modes and Media of Contemporary Communication. Edward Arnold). It is argued that the ideologies reflected in the news discourse are beliefs and values that are constructed and reinforced by choices in language and in images. The analysis shows that the news about Mandarin Excellence is reported according to its political, economic and cultural worth and that the news reports on Mandarin Excellence represent a way to strengthen the existing power and cultural governance of the UK government#FRE#
