#ITI#A demographic and qualitative analysis of the determinants of success in a National Supported Employment project#FTI#
#IRE#Background: People with an intellectual disability and/or autism experience low employment rates compared to the general population. This study shows what the determinants of success are in getting this group of young people into paid employment. Method: The research is based on data collected on 1008 young people, aged 16–25, participating in the Engage to Change project across Wales, to support young people to achieve employment. A real-time data collection system was used from their engagement and throughout their journey to employment. Results: This research indicates an overall employment rate of 23% for the project to date, based on total referral. Young people who engaged in ‘significant work experience’, such as paid placement or supported internship, had a greater employment rate of 37%. Conclusion: Previous and current real work experiences increased the chances of young people of becoming employed, above the effect of supported employment and job coach support#FRE#
