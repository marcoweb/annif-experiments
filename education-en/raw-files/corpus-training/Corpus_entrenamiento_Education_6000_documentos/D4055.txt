#ITI#Design precepts for online experiential learning programs to address wicked sustainability problems#FTI#
#IRE#There are increasing pressures within the higher education sector to incorporate digital pedagogies into teaching and learning, a trend amplified by recent extensive recourse to online delivery within the sector. This trend carries with it both opportunities and challenges in effectively fostering those graduate competences that a converging consensus identifies as essential for sustainability education to nurture. The challenge for educators is to design programs capable of fostering a range of competences fit for wicked sustainability problems. The principal objective of this paper is to review the literature regarding the competences that would adequately equip graduates of sustainability coursework programs with substantial online delivery components for a professional environment of uncertainty, complexity, and wicked problems. From the review of scholarship focused on competences for online experiential learning, sustainability education and wicked problems solving, we assemble a set of precepts to guide the design of effective learning outcomes, settings and pedagogies for an approach to sustainability education that better prepares students for such a challenging environment. While the precepts apply to sustainability education generally, we argue that they provide particular guidance for educators concerned with e-learning. We also present educational, social and technological enablers to underpin design, development and delivery processes#FRE#
