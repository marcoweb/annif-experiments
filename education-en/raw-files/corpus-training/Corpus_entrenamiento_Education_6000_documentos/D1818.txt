#ITI#Comparative interaction patterns of groups in an open network environment: The role of facilitators in collaborative learning#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Collaborative learning can effectively promote the development of higher-order competencies, where learners collaborate via social interactions to explore and solve complex problems. It has been found that the effective occurrence of collaborative learning requires appropriate external guidance and support. In particular, collaborative interactions in open learning environments are more complex and difficult, which makes it important to provide dynamic interventions for learners according to different collaborative situations. However, the role of facilitators and the characteristics and mechanisms of their interventions have yet to be thoroughly investigated. Objectives: The study aims to uncover the characteristics and patterns of interaction among groups with different collaborative performance and facilitator performance in an open learning environment, and to explore the differentiated role of facilitators in this process. Method: Groups are categorised as high or low based on their collaborative performance and facilitator performance. This study used lag sequential analysis (LSA) and content analysis to explore the interaction patterns of groups with different collaborative performance and facilitator performance. Also, the different roles of facilitators were analysed by comparing the differences in interaction patterns of different collaborative performance groups. Results: The study found that groups with different collaborative performances and facilitator performances showed significant differences in interaction patterns, and the two had crossover effects. There is also variability in the role of facilitators in groups with different collaborative performance profiles. Patterns of transition between different layers of interaction can indicate the level of groups' collaborative engagement. Specific interaction patterns exist that are conducive to enhancing collaborative learning. Conclusions: The results of the study pointed out that groups with different collaborative performance and facilitator performance showed different characteristics of interaction patterns. The role of the facilitator in online collaborative learning is characterised by compensatory and merit-promoting. High-quality online collaboration is the result of multiple factors, including learners and facilitators working together. This study has practical implications for the design of instructional interventions for group collaboration in online learning communities#FRE#
