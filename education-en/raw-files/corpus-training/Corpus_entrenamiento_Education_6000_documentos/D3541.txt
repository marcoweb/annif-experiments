#ITI#Indicators of health in Down syndrome: A virtual focus group study with patients and their parents#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Down syndrome has a unique medical and psychological profile. To date, few studies have asked individuals with Down syndrome about their views of health. Methods: Eight focus groups of 20 parents and 8 individuals with Down syndrome, were conducted virtually via videoconferencing to obtain participants' views of health indicators. Focus group moderators employed some modifications for individuals with Down syndrome, including simplified language and use of graphics. Transcripts were coded using a hybrid inductive/deductive framework and thematically analysed using the Framework Method. Results: We describe lessons learned in conducting virtual focus groups of individuals with Down syndrome and their parents. Individuals with Down syndrome could describe their views of health indicators and identified many of the same topics as their parents. Both groups discussed physical, mental, and social health components. However, people with Down syndrome gave a more restricted range of examples, but with different nuances than parents. Conclusion: Partcipants discussed physical, social, and mental well-being components of health in Down syndrome. Interviewing individuals with Down syndrome in virtual focus groups with appropriate modifications added important self-report health information#FRE#
