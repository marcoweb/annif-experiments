#ITI#Dyslexia debated, then and now: a historical perspective on the dyslexia debate#FTI#
#IRE#The ‘dyslexia debate’ is resilient. In the media, a key component of the debate is the notion that dyslexia does not exist, popularised by a series of vociferous commentators. For them, dyslexia is an invention of overly-concerned parents, supported by a clique of private educational psychologists willing to offer a diagnosis–for a fee–even where no condition exists. In academic circles, especially psychology, dyslexia critiques are also present. In these, the principal argument is that the term ‘dyslexia’ is unhelpful–more an emotive word designed to attract funding, than a clearly defined scientific condition. Such arguments stand against other research in psychology, and discussion has become contentious. Largely missing from both sides of the debate, however, is a historical perspective. In this article, the origins of the dyslexia debate are traced, showing how queries about the term’s efficacy have marked dyslexia’s history since it was first identified in the 1870s. Through this tracing, this account seeks to move discussion beyond the existing either/or binary of dyslexia’s existence#FRE#
