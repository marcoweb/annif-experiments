#ITI#Effects of a Video Feedback Intervention on Sensitivity in Early Childhood Teachers in Chile#FTI#
#IRE#Preschool teachers can become attachment figures that complement the children’s families of origin, becoming relevant actors in their early development. This article presents the results of a group video feedback program on early childhood teachers in public centers. The model, which focuses on promoting “educational sensitivity”, comprises 5 group sessions. A pre-post evaluation of 157 participants was conducted by coding dyad and group interaction videos. After the intervention, a significant increase relative to the baseline was found in measures of dyad (d = 0.67) and group sensitivity (d = 0.13), among other positive outcomes. Likewise, a significant association was found between variables of dyadic sensitivity and group sensitivity, concurrently and prospectively. The promising results obtained support the viability of the model in early education. Future studies should include a control group and randomization measures to strengthen these conclusions and incorporate a follow-up component to evaluate the program’s long-term impact on educators#FRE#
