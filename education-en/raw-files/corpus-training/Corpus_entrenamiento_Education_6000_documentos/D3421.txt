#ITI#Pasifika girls resisting the schooling regime of safety#FTI#
#IRE#In the last few decades, the word ‘safety’ has become silently but increasingly pervasive in educational policies and debates, gaining a new momentum with the pandemic. Our intention in this article is to problematise what is done in schools in the name of safety by delving into the safety policy discourses of a New Zealand school and the narratives of resistance employed by a group of female Pasifika students during the Covid-19 crisis. This critical ethnographic inquiry explores how safety at schools operates as a mechanism to oppress their fights and reproduce inequalities in an era of apparent ‘racism without racists’#FRE#
