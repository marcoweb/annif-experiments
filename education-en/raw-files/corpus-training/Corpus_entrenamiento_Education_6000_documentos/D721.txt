#ITI#Lessons learned from enabling large-scale assessment change: a collaborative autoethnographic study#FTI#
#IRE# The global pandemic prompted universities to rethink how assessment might be reconfigured to better support student learning across different modes of delivery resulting in unprecedented, large-scale, and rapid institutional change. Significantly, there has been a dearth of empirical studies examining the nuances of staff experiences of how they have managed and negotiated assessment change throughout the pandemic context. In this article we aim to bridge this gap. We are four colleagues at different UK higher education institutions who have all been involved in leading the sustained assessment response to the pandemic within our own organisations. We use collaborative autoethnography (CAE) to explore and analyse our approaches to enabling large-scale assessment change with the aim of locating sharable lessons for educational developers and others leading change efforts in higher education. We articulate key lessons generated from our collaborative exploration that we believe may be useful to other education developers and/or academic practitioners who seek to change the assessment landscape within a course, faculty, or institution. The lessons presented offer an alternative frame for managing future-facing assessment change in higher education that is sensitive to both the practice realities of practitioners and the impact subsequent change has on student learning and performance#FRE#
