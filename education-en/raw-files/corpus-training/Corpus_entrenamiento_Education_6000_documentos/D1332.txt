#ITI#Assessing culturally inclusive instructional design in online learning#FTI#
#IRE# This study assessed the psychometric properties of the culturally inclusive instructional design (CIID) scale with 31 items on a 7-point Likert scale. The data were collected from the training (N = 55) and validating samples (N = 80) of K-20 educators. Data analysis employed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). EFA results revealed a clear five-factor structure, and the CFA results indicated good factor loadings. The reliability indices were.95 and.94 for the training and validation samples, respectively. The significant correlations among the factors indicated the five subscales measuring on the same CIID construct. In contrast, a non-perfect correlation presented a discriminating power for each subscale measuring the unique dimension of the construct. The study results established the validity and reliability of the instrument to measure culturally inclusive instructional design with implications for the design and development of online learning for cultural inclusivity#FRE#
