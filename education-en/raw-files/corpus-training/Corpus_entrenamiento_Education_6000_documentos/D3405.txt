#ITI#LMPD's Blank Incident Report: The erasure of Breonna Taylor as a curriculum of conviviality#FTI#
#IRE#This article includes a description and discussion of physical violence and identity-based discrimination. I acknowledge that this content may be difficult. I encourage you to care for your safety and well-being. This article examines ‘conviviality’ in the context of police violence and systemic racism in the United States. Through an analysis of police incident reports and media interviews, the article argues that discourses of conviviality perpetuate colonial legacies and order Black lives. The article challenges the idea that conviviality is without consequence and highlights its limits in the face of ongoing discrimination and violence against Black people#FRE#
