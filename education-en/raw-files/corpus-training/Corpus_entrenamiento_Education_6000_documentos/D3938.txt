#ITI#Developmental trajectories for novice teachers: teaching efficacy, instructional beliefs, and domain knowledge#FTI#
#IRE#The current study investigates the developmental trajectories of novice elementary teachers’ self-efficacy science beliefs, their science instructional beliefs and science knowledge over the course of participants’ teacher preparation and into their first two years of teaching. Study results indicate changes in teachers’ self-efficacy science beliefs, in their science instructional beliefs, and changes in science knowledge. Additionally, teachers’ growth in science content knowledge had an impact on teachers’ self-efficacy science beliefs and on teachers’ instructional science beliefs. Findings from our study can help teacher educators, researchers, and policy makers in better understanding novice elementary teachers’ science developmental trajectories and the role of knowledge and beliefs in their professional growth#FRE#
