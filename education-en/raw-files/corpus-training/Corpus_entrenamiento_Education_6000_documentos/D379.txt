#ITI#Effectiveness of a Mastery Climate Cognitive-Motor Skills School-based Intervention in children living in poverty: Motor and Academic performance, self-perceptions, and BMI#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Children living in poverty often are exposed to situations that negatively affect various aspects of their development. So, it is important to propose interventional programs that minimize the negative effects of living in poverty on these children. Objective: To verify the impact of a mastery climate cognitive-motor skills school-based intervention on academic and motor performance, body mass index, and perceptions of competence and self-worth in children living in poverty. Method: 280 children (50% girls), 7- to10-years-old, from Ceará state–Brazil, participated in this study. Intervention (IG, N = 140) and comparison (N = 140) groups were composed. The Test of Gross Motor Development–2, the Self-Perception Profile for Children, the School Performance Test (reading, writing, math), and the Body Mass Index (BMI) were used. Children in the IG participated in a mastery climate intervention and children in the CG in a recreational sports program for 12 weeks (36 sessions /140 min each session/ three times a week) with 60 min of academic activities, 20 min recess and snacks, and 60 min of motor practices. Results: The intervention group showed significant improvement from pre- to post-test, and higher motor, academic (reading, math), perceived competence, social acceptance, and self-worth scores than the comparison group at pos-test (p from 0.031 to <0.001). Conclusion: Mastery climate cognitive-motor intervention positively impacts the motor and academic performance and the self-perceptions of the children living in poverty, reinforcing the need for these interventions to helping children become more proficient and assured about their competences#FRE#
