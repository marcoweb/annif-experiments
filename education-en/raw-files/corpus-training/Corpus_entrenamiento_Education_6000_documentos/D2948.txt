#ITI#Easy-Amanida: An R Shiny application for the meta-analysis of aggregate results in clinical metabolomics using Amanida and Webchem#FTI#
#IRE# Meta-analysis is a useful tool in clinical research, as it combines the results of multiple clinical studies to improve precision when answering a particular scientific question. While there has been a substantial increase in publications using meta-analysis in various clinical research topics, the number of published meta-analyses in metabolomics is significantly lower compared to other omics disciplines. Metabolomics is the study of small chemical compounds in living organisms, which provides important insights into an organism's phenotype. However, the wide variety of compounds and the different experimental methods used in metabolomics make it challenging to perform a thorough meta-analysis. Additionally, there is a lack of consensus on reporting statistical estimates, and the high number of compound naming synonyms further complicates the process. Easy-Amanida is a new tool that combines two R packages, “amanida” and “webchem”, to enable meta-analysis of aggregate statistical data, like p-value and fold-change, while ensuring the compounds naming harmonization. The Easy-Amanida app is implemented in Shiny, an R package add-on for interactive web apps, and provides a workflow to optimize the naming combination. This article describes all the steps to perform the meta-analysis using Easy-Amanida, including an illustrative example for interpreting the results. The use of aggregate statistics metrics extends the use of Easy-Amanida beyond the metabolomics field#FRE#
