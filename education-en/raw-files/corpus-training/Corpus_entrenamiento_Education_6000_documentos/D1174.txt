#ITI#Discursive burdens: negotiating difference in an education movement#FTI#
#IRE# Recent efforts to opt out of assessments have focused attention on the role that testing plays in accountability reforms in the United States. While opt-out activists often invoke the disproportionate impact of these reforms on communities of color, opting out has been more widespread in mostly White, affluent, and suburban communities. This study explores how resistance to testing is embedded in larger discourses of race, privilege, and opportunity in education. Through discourse analysis, we explore how activists located themselves within racial groups at a national conference in the United States. We show how (1) the mention of racialized identities was often accompanied by discursive markers that anticipated social discomfort and (2) activists of color named their racialized identities more so than White activists, and in ways that were strategic, suggesting activists of color did the harder work of weaving together a racially diverse movement#FRE#
