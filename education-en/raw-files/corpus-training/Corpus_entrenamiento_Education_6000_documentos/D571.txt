#ITI#Of the Coming of John: A Contemporary Counter-Story of Race and Gifted Education#FTI#
#IRE# Upholding critical race theory (CRT)’s transdisciplinary approach to unveil the educational violence against Students of Color, we apply W.E.B. Du Bois’s story of John from the chapter “Of the Coming of John” in The Souls of Black Folk. In doing so, we expose the problematic ideological and practical structures used for the identification and retention of Students of Color within gifted and talented programming. Examining the concepts of the Veil and double consciousness through the analogous relationship of Du Bois’s John to a contemporary John, we parallel the insidious educational experiences of Students of Color that has remained relatively constant over time.#FRE#
