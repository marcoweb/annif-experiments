#ITI#Conceptualisation and measurement of foreign language learning burnout among Chinese EFL students#FTI#
#IRE#The study seeks to conceptualise foreign language learning burnout and provide its corresponding measurement. The 15-item Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (MBI-SS) was rephrased to fit an English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) learning context. The modified MBI-SS was then assessed among 1718 Chinese secondary EFL students. A final 10-item Maslach Burnout Inventory-EFL Student Survey was obtained based on a series of reliability (e.g. item analysis, internal consistency) and validity (construct validity, convergent validity, and criterion validity) test results. According to the confirmatory factor analysis results, foreign language learning burnout is a three-dimensional construct encompassing Exhaustion, Cynicism, and Reduced Efficacy, confirming the invariance of the original tri-factorial structure of the MBI-SS. In addition, participants reported low levels of foreign language learning burnout, Exhaustion, Cynicism, and Reduced Efficacy. Possible reasons for foreign language learning burnout were discussed with reference to the FL educational context in China. We also proposed directions for future research#FRE#
