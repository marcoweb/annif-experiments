#ITI#Barriers to technology integration: A time-series survey study#FTI#
#IRE# Barriers to technology integration continue to make it difficult for teachers to use educational technologies in the classroom. This 3-year time-series survey study conducted in K-12 public schools in a North Midwestern US state investigates teachers’ perceptions of how barriers to technology integration change over time, and how barriers may not be the same in different settings including small and large school districts. Results indicate that time was the most stable and persistent barrier to technology integration. Access to technology tools and resources increased, yet teacher beliefs, and training and technical support declined over time. Teachers from smaller school districts reported higher access to technology tools and resources and higher administrative support. Recommendations to improve educational technology integration in K-12 schools are provided#FRE#
