#ITI#Science Teacher Motivation and Evaluation Policy in a High-Stakes Testing State#FTI#
#IRE# This qualitative case study explored the teachers’ and administrators’ perceptions of a newly implemented teacher evaluation policy in a high-stakes testing state, and how this policy impacted their motivation. Five science teachers and their immediate supervisors were interviewed, and their perceptions were analyzed through motivational theories of incentivizing career behaviors. Findings suggest the overarching goal of improving teacher practice through accountability was facilitated by intrinsic motivation and challenged by weaknesses in policy design. These tensions could be mediated by localized control that improves stakeholder agency, peer learning communities, and the adoption of more reliable evaluation metrics. Implications for teacher buy-in of evaluation policy are discussed.#FRE#
