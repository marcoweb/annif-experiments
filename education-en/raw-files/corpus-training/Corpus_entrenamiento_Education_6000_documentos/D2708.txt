#ITI#Utilizing augmented reality for embodied mental rotation training: A learning analytics study#FTI#
#IRE# Mental rotation is the ability to mentally rotate two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects in one's mind. Previous studies have examined the relationship between mental rotation abilities and embodied cognition. However, conflicting findings underscore the necessity for further investigation. This study aims to investigate how different levels of embodiment in mental rotation training affect mental rotation training. Three versions of mental rotation training with different levels of embodiment (keyboard, touchpad and augmented reality) were developed for this study. A quasi-experimental study was conducted with a total of 125 university students to explore how different training versions affect participants' training performances, perception of the usability of the training and mental rotation ability. The results suggest those who used the versions with higher levels of bodily engagement performed better than those who used the versions with lower levels of bodily engagement (p < 0.001). Participants' mental rotation ability also improved significantly after training with the augmented reality (AR1) version compared to those in the keyboard group (p = 0.01). The learning analytics results provide additional clarity by indicating that the participants' mental rotation ability can be predicted by their training performance in the AR condition (p < 0.001). This study has significant implications for the potential of using embodied AR training to improve mental rotation ability. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Mental rotation ability is a malleable trait that can be improved through repeated and long-term game-based training. Short-term training using digital games has limited impacts on mental rotation ability. Mental rotation abilities are linked to our bodily interactions with the physical world. What this paper adds Investigates how different levels of bodily engagement in a digital game affect short-term mental rotation training. Investigates how different levels of bodily engagement in a mental rotation training game affect players' game performance and perception of the usability of the game. Investigates if players' performance in a mental rotation training game can predict their mental rotation ability and self-diagnosed sense of direction. Leverages learning analytics to explain findings generated by traditional research methods. Implications for practice and/or policy Leveraging augmented reality technology in more embodied mental rotation training games can facilitate short-term gains in mental rotation. Game-based learning researchers should consider leveraging learning analytics techniques to provide richer and more nuanced explanations for findings generated by traditional research methods. Game performance in effective mental rotation training games can predict mental rotation abilities, thus potentially assessing such abilities#FRE#
