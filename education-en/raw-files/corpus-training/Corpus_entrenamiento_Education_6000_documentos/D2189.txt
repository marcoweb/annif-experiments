#ITI#Barriers and enablers to K-12 blended teaching#FTI#
#IRE# The attributes of post-pandemic blended teaching (BT) will more closely resemble pre-Coronavirus conditions than the outbreak’s emergency remote teaching. Thus, barriers and enablers for teachers transitioning to BT after emergency remote teaching will be similar to those of early BT adopters. K-12 research has identified external and internal barriers and enablers to technology integration but has largely overlooked those of BT. This study involved analyzing 62 interviews of K-12 blended teachers to discover factors that enabled BT, stood as barriers to initial and continued blending efforts, and helped teachers overcome barriers. Teacher-perceived barriers included, among others, costs perceived as outweighing benefits, lack of administrative support, and student characteristics. Enablers included teachers’ dispositions, cohort support, and various classroom benefits. Implications for research and practice are discussed#FRE#
