#ITI#Pharmacological treatment of children with ADHD: how educators persuade parents to use it#FTI#
#IRE#Educators are key in advising doctors and parents on whether to medicate pupils with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Here, using a semi-structured in-depth interview and grounded theory, we ask how 138 Israeli teachers and headmasters perceive their role in parents’ decisions to medicate. Generally, teachers refrain from persuading parents to use medication and some even talk them out of it. There is, however, a gradual escalation in educators’ attitudes towards persuading parents to medicate when educators consider the difficulties flowing from ADHD. When these difficulties find expression mainly in pupils’ achievements, persuasion is usually indirect, manifested in hints to parents about the need to medicate. When problematic if not violent behaviour manifests, stronger persuasive tactics are used, such as summoning parents to meetings and suspending pupils. Many educators do not regard these sanctions against parents who resist medicating their children as unfair pressure but do admit that they are meant to persuade parents to allow medication. Thus, Israeli educators send a bivalent message. The system’s approach explicitly upholds parents’ right to decide on their own. The other voice is manifested in de facto policy, especially when the behaviour of the pupil with ADHD is improper#FRE#
