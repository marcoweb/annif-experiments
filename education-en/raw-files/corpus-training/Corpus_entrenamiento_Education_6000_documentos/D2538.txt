#ITI#The influence of relational, political, discursive, and structural dimensions of power on increasing equitable access to undergraduate research experiences#FTI#
#IRE# Attracting and retaining students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics majors, particularly those who are underrepresented, is a national concern. While undergraduate research experiences have been shown to increase retention and engagement, inequities in access exacerbate disparities. Understanding what hinders or facilitates the implementation of undergraduate research experiences is crucial. Using semi-structured interviews with the project leaders and document analysis, the findings from this project expose the relational, political, discursive, and structural power dimensions hindering or facilitating the integration of research experiences in undergraduate science courses. Revealing these barriers and opportunities will inform future initiatives, such as those focused on implementing course-based research experiences#FRE#
