#ITI#Disaffected teachers: disrupting normalized feelings of race and gender in teacher education research#FTI#
#IRE# Making sense of normalized feelings in teacher education, scholarship on race and gender has spotlighted the affective and emotional landscapes of teaching and detailed how the profession has been shaped around its primary workers, cisgender straight white women. Disaffection, though, or unfeeling in ways that disrupt the sociality of affective norms, provides one conceptual and methodological tool for shifting well-worn patterns of normalized feelings in teacher education. Revisiting data from two previous studies of teachers’ affective practices, we used disaffection as a lens to analyze interview and group session transcripts, interpreting how unfeeling disrupts the racialized and gendered norms of grieving and liberationist politics of outness in classrooms. Inviting antisociality, disaffection offers researchers and educators a methodological expansion for studying affect, emotion, and feeling in teacher education, specifically by looking for the absent presence of unfeeling#FRE#
