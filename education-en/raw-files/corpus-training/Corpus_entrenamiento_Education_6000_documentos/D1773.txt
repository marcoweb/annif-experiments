#ITI#Effects of AR- and VR-based wearables in teaching English: The application of an ARCS model-based learning design to improve elementary school students' learning motivation and performance#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Previous research has examined the use of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) in English language teaching. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the earlier studies that investigated integrating AR and VR “wearables” into teaching and learning English based on the attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) motivation model compared the differences in learning motivation and performance between traditional teaching methods and those using AR- and VR-based using wearables. Objectives: To create a thematic learning environment based on learners' lived experiences and provide them with an immersive English course that extends textbook knowledge using a technology-assisted real-life learning context. Method: This study used a quasi-experimental research design. A total of 119 participants were spilt into three learning groups based on teaching tools: traditional methods and AR- and VR-based wearable devices. The performance of each group was evaluated through three stages using appropriate educational tools for traditional, AR-, and VR-based classrooms, followed by semistructured interviews. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to investigate the inference learning performance (remembering and analysing) of the four ARCS dimensions with the three teaching methods. Results: The results showed that confidence and relevance were positively correlated with learning performance in the VR-based wearable group. In the context of the ARCS model, learners' confidence predicted learning performance and the remembering subdimension when VR-based learning materials were used. Implications: These results suggest that, compared to traditional teaching methods, VR-based wearables make it easier to create a highly immersive learning environment and are more likely to help learners find the correct words, improve their accuracy, and increase their confidence and sense of accomplishment in the entire learning process#FRE#
