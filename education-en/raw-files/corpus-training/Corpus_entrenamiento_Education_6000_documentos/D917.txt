#ITI#The Construction and Validation of the Visuospatial Self-Efficacy (VSSE) Scale#FTI#
#IRE# Visuospatial (VS) skills have been shown to be a crucial foundation for success in STEM courses and careers while the impact of visuospatial self-efficacy (VSSE) has been overlooked. To address the lack of a reliable instrument to measure VSSE, we developed and validated a VSSE scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis of the initial 42 scale items (n = 179) suggested a five-factor structure with 25 items retained. Confirmatory Factor Analysis of the 25 items (n = 183) demonstrated a reasonable model fit to the data. Coupled with acceptable to high levels of internal consistency, the results indicate that the VSSE scale can be used as a diagnostic and research tool in educational practice and future research#FRE#
