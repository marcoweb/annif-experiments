#ITI#Making sense of adaptive expertise for frontline clinical educators: a scoping review of definitions and strategies#FTI#
#IRE# Adaptive expertise has been promoted as an emerging model of expertise in health professions education in response to the inherent complexities of patient care; however, as the concept increasingly influences the structure of professional training and practice, it creates the potential for misunderstandings of the definition and implications of adaptive expertise. To foster a common understanding of the concept, we conducted a scoping review to explore how adaptive expertise has been discussed within health professions education literature. Five databases—MedLine, PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, and PsycINFO—were searched using the exact term “adaptive expertise”, producing 212 unique articles. Fifty-eight articles met inclusion criteria. In the included articles, authors discussed the conceptual implications of adaptive expertise for health professions education, strategies for training for adaptive expertise, and research findings aimed at supporting the development of adaptive expertise or utilizing adaptive expertise as a theoretical framework. The goal of this scoping review is to establish a resource for frontline educators tasked with fostering the development of adaptive expertise in learners through education initiatives. A common understanding of adaptive expertise is essential to ensuring effective implementation in training programs#FRE#
