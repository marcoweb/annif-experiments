#ITI#Shared Reading and Science Vocabulary for Kindergarten Students#FTI#
#IRE#Kindergarten students commonly receive a limited amount of exposure to scientific concepts and informational texts. The present study used a multiple probe design across participants to determine the effects of shared reading instruction on three kindergarten students' science-related vocabulary acquisition in a virtual classroom during the Covid-19 pandemic. The interventionist delivered explicit vocabulary instruction by reading aloud a science picture book and intentionally pausing to define, explain, and discuss vocabulary words that were unfamiliar to young students. Researcher-developed vocabulary probes were administered every fifth instructional session and measured specific words taught during instruction. Results of virtual shared reading instruction indicate positive effects (Tau-U = 0.222–0.933) on kindergarten students’ science vocabulary learning. Students, their instructor, and caregivers all perceived the shared reading instruction as beneficial for science vocabulary development. These findings suggest explicit science vocabulary instruction during shared reading is beneficial to students and feasible for teachers to implement in a virtual classroom#FRE#
