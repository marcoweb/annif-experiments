#ITI#The experiences and views of adults with intellectual disabilities accessing digital mental health interventions: A qualitative systematic review and thematic synthesis#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Technology is ubiquitous in all aspects of daily life and research interest in the topic of digital mental health interventions (DMHI) for people with intellectual disabilities is growing. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated technology use in delivering mental health supports. Method: This review used a qualitative systematic literature review methodology with the aim of collating the views and experiences of adults with intellectual disabilities accessing DMHI. The electronic databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and SCOPUS were searched in March 2022. Results: Five studies were selected in this review, and three major narrative themes were generated, each with sub-themes: (1) User experience with DMHI (personal experience, digital experience); (2) Relationships fostered through technology (interpersonal support, relating to virtual characters, computer as skilled helper); (3) Psychological benefits (new skills development, personal autonomy development). Conclusion: This review highlights that, although there is a diversity of views and experiences of people with intellectual disabilities, the evidence suggests that DMHI has potential to support this population given the right opportunities. Findings also point to the benefit of technology as a complement to therapy, but not necessarily as a replacement to in-person therapeutic encounters#FRE#
