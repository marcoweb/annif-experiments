#ITI#Coping with teaching in innovative learning spaces: challenges, insights and practices#FTI#
#IRE#The current study involved investigating elementary-and middle-school teachers' perceptions of teaching in Innovative Learning Spaces (ILS). ILS incorporating technology have been recently designed for many schools around the world wishing to update the teaching–learning process to fit students' needs in the twenty-first century. Thirty-four elementary- and middle-school teachers participated in the study, which contributes to the field by capturing a wider perspective of teachers' perceptions and practices using two qualitative tools: semi-structured interviews and observations. Four aspects of teaching in ILS found challenging by both elementary- and middle-school teachers were identified, as well as insights into coping. Within these areas, minor differences were detected because of difference in the nature of teaching in both types of schools. Teacher practices echoed identified challenges, showing difficulties in diverging from traditional teaching strategies when transferring to ILS. The main conclusion is that the transition to teaching in ILS needs to address the issue of changing teachers' habits and strategies in all areas. Based on this, a recommended four-stage PD program for applying and sustaining the novel teaching–learning strategies can prevent a relapse into traditional and familiar ways of teaching, which reduces the effectiveness of ILS#FRE#
