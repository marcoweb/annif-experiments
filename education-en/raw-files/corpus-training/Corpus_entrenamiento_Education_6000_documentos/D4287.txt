#ITI#Remote classroom modelling: a professional development model for in-service generalist primary teachers of science#FTI#
#IRE#We present a model for Professional Development (PD) for in-service generalist primary teachers of science. The Remote Classroom Modelling (RCM) model is specifically designed to address salient challenges in the context of professional isolation. We share the principles that supported the design of this PD prototype, and the insights and lessons learned from a pilot of the model. We employed open-ended questionnaires, individual interviews and focus group interviews using a qualitative exploratory study to capture the experiences of teachers and students involved in this trial. Our findings suggest that the model supports primary teachers in developing: (1) their technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge, (2) their leadership, and (3) their resourcefulness in science. Our analysis reveals two important factors underpinning the successful implementation of this model: participant engagement and expert support. We discuss the applicability of this model in different settings and propose an agenda to progress the development of the RCM. © The Australian Association for Research in Education, Inc. 2022.#FRE#
