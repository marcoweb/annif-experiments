#ITI#Developing an inquiry-based laboratory curriculum to engage students in planning investigations and argumentation#FTI#
#IRE#Reform efforts in Taiwan have added a mandatory ‘Scientific Inquiry and Practice’ curriculum for all high school students, emphasising ‘inquiry-based learning content’ including observing and questioning, planning and carrying out an investigation, argumentation and modelling, and expression and sharing. The purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry-based laboratory curriculum and to explore students’ performance by emphasising ‘expression and sharing’ during the planning of their investigations and argumentation. This ‘Scientific Inquiry and Practice’ curriculum lasted 60 h with 17 10th graders. We employed Science Writing Heuristics to help students integrate inquiry, argumentation, and writing practice into laboratory contexts. Data collected via a Multimedia-based Assessment of Scientiﬁc Inquiry Abilities, an Achievement Test, students’ writing in their Argumentation Writing Journal, and semi-structured interviews showed that some of the students’ scientiﬁc inquiry abilities, argumentation abilities, and content learning were improved after participating. Moreover, engaging students in the practice of ‘expression and sharing’ provided them with opportunities to develop competency in designing and evaluating the scientific inquiry, and scientifically interpreting data and evidence. Various interpretations of these results are discussed, and the implications of this study can provide a template for the development of an inquiry-based laboratory curriculum in education and research#FRE#
