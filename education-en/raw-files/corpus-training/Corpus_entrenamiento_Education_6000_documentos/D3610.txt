#ITI#Preparing adults with intellectual disabilities for their future: How do support services staff view their role?#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Person-centred service delivery underpins current approaches to working with individuals with intellectual disabilities. We investigated views of staff from a service organisation regarding their roles in creating desired futures for adults with intellectual disabilities. Methods: Data were gathered from staff of a large organisation that provided a range of services to adults with intellectual disabilities. Respondents were asked to describe their role in assisting an individual with intellectual disability to meet their goals for the future. Responses were analysed using a text analysis programme. Results: Two major themes were identified: ‘Support for self-determination’ and ‘Business-as-usual’. These themes were not entirely separate but had some overlap. There were indications that staff experienced competing demands in their role(s). Conclusion: Although central to person-centred planning, staff who work with adults with intellectual disabilities may not see support of self-determination as a key factor in creating a desired future#FRE#
