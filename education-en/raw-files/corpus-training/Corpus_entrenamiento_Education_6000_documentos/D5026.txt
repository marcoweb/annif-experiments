#ITI#Class Matters: Employing Photovoice With First-Generation Poor and Working-Class College Students as a Lens on Intersecting Identities#FTI#
#IRE#This study examines how first-generation (FG) college students make meaning of their social class during their first-year of college. As a method, photovoice allowed for the creation of a rich set of data using student photos and accompanying narratives, through which three key themes were derived: (a) broken American dream, (b) honoring family sacrifices, and (c) lifting generations. This study informs both future practice and research by providing a deep understanding of the intersection of students’ individual identities, contexts, and motivations through the lens of the social class worldview model (SCWM)#FRE#
