#ITI#Culturally Engaging Courses and Campuses for LGBQ+ Issues#FTI#
#IRE#Current literature underscores the need to address unwelcoming campus climates for lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning, and other sexual minority identities (LGBQ+) students both in and outside of the classroom by taking a critical look at the practices adopted at the institution. Using a large-scale, multi-institution quantitative and qualitative data set, this study examined student perceptions of the inclusion of LGBQ+ issues in curricula and how this relates to other forms of engagement. We found differences in student perceptions by major and sexuality, and that relationships between engagement and LGBQ+ curricular inclusion are strong for LGBQ+ and non-LGBQ+ students. Quotes from students highlight the disconnect felt between coursework and discussions of sexuality, as well as the great importance of creating inclusive spaces for the LGBQ+ community#FRE#
