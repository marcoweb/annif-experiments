#ITI#Tacit knowledge in dyads of persons with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities and their caregivers: An interpretative literature study#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Caring for persons with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) demands specific expertise. Tacit knowledge seems to play an important role, but little is known about its nature, including what is necessary for its development and transfer. Aim: To gain understanding of the nature and development of tacit knowledge between persons with PIMD and their caregivers. Method: We conducted an interpretative synthesis of literature on tacit knowledge in caregiving dyads with persons with PIMD, persons with dementia or infants. Twelve studies were included. Results: Tacit knowledge is about caregivers and care-recipients becoming sensitive and responsive to each other's cues and together crafting care routines. Learning takes place in a constant process of action and response that transforms those involved. Conclusion: Building tacit knowledge together is necessary for persons with PIMD to learn to recognise and express their needs. Suggestions are made for ways to facilitate its development and transfer#FRE#
