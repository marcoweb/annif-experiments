#ITI#Media literacy education nurturing civic participation of disadvantaged youth, or not?#FTI#
#IRE# There has been active debate in recent years whether media literacy education can or even should nurture civic participation. Despite a growing number of theoretical and empirical studies, the question remains unanswered. This paper contributes to the debate with participatory action research conducted with vocational school students in the Czech Republic. Seventeen students aged 17–19 took part in the study over the course of three months. They received weekly interventions applying the citizenship model of media literacy and focusing on ‘create’, ‘reflect’, and ‘act’ competences. The research and educational intervention turned out to be a positive learning experience for students, which exceeded the originally expected outcome. The project found that the students’ immediate media literacy in these competences improved. However, the enhancement of their long-term civic participation remained questionable. This study argues for a student-centered, school-routines-breaking, and hands-on approach to media literacy education supporting civic participation of disadvantaged youth#FRE#
