#ITI#Role of technology in the design of learning environments#FTI#
#IRE#The design of learning environments is being increasingly investigated, largely as a result of higher-education providers being challenged by both societal and technological developments. These providers are becoming more aware that the quality of learning environments affects students’ approaches to learning and satisfaction. This paper presents an alternative to more-traditional methods for designing learning environments that is driven by input of their main stakeholders: students and teachers. By using this method, we were able to explore stakeholders’ insights into learning spaces design and how learning technologies can be integrated in such spaces. Qualitative research was conducted with the aim of guiding the redesign of technology-enhanced learning environments. For this particular research, we used ‘sandpits’, which are creative and design-thinking workshops, in which participants are encouraged to redesign provocative concepts of a large and a small technology-enhanced learning environment. Thirteen ‘sandpits’ were delivered involving 32 teachers and 25 students. Through these design-thinking workshops, students and teachers reflected on and discussed the role of technology in face-to-face learning and teaching and proposed new design solutions for technology-enhanced learning environments#FRE#
