#ITI#Teaching while traumatized: an autoethnographic account of teaching, triggers, and the higher education classroom#FTI#
#IRE#With this paper, we present an autoethnographic account of how two higher education teachers have navigated the classroom as they deal with their own traumatic experiences. This includes discussions of how each individualâ€™s trauma developed and manifests in the classroom, as well as discussions of various pedagogical implications/strategies for other higher education teachers dealing with trauma. To begin, we outline the research on trauma, highlighting the ways in which the research landscape characteristically looks at how teachers (typically K-12) might better educate students dealing with trauma and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Next, we discuss autoethnography as one methodology that articulates embedded experience that is informed by power and personal reactions, responses, and experiences. We then discuss how these traumatic experiences impact our pedagogy and overall feelings of safety on college campuses, which also includes strategies that we use to mitigate the harmful effects of our traumas#FRE#
