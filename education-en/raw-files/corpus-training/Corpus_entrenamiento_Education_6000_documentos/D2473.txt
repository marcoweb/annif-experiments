#ITI#A structural model of student experiences in a career-forward chemistry laboratory curriculum#FTI#
#IRE# Persistence is a major issue facing students, particularly those who are both female and from underrepresented ethnic minorities (URM). A closer look at the variables affecting their commitment and capacity for continuing the pursuit of their goal allows us to better design support systems that bolster persistence. This study tests a structural equation model (SEM) for students using a career-forward laboratory chemistry curriculum based upon the Mediation Model of Research Experience (MMRE) that explains the relationships among self-efficacy, identity as an engineer, and commitment to an engineering career. Data were collected from 426 undergraduate engineering majors at the end of the semester using a previously constructed survey for three semesters of general chemistry laboratory for engineering majors. The research question was addressed using bivariate correlations and a series of SEMs where multigroup analyses were conducted separately for non-URM and URM participants. Bivariate correlations show significant positive associations between all four variables for the entire group of students. However, when disaggregated, the only significant association for URM participants (n = 109) was between identity as an engineer and commitment to an engineering career. Notably, teamwork self-efficacy was a negative predictor of commitment to an engineering career for URM participants. Beta-coefficients from the SEM show that identity and engineering self-efficacy are the variables most predictive of commitment, with identity being nearly twice as predictive for URM students. This study adds support for professional identity as a key predictive variable for career commitment for URM participants and indicates that a laboratory curriculum that emphasizes applied professional practice can support persistence. Considering the degree to which teamwork is emphasized generally, additional studies are needed to better understand the implications for URM students. Particularly in applications that emphasize long-term outcomes#FRE#
