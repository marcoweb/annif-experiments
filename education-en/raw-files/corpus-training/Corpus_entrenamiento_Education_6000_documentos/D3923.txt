#ITI#Development, validity, and reliability of chemistry scientific creativity test for pre-university students#FTI#
#IRE#This study describes the development, validity, and reliability processes of a scientific creativity test for pre-university students, specifically in chemistry. A Chemistry Scientific Creativity Test (CSCT) was constructed based on an analysis of the Scientific Creativity Structure Model (SCSM), Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT), and aspects of scientific creativity found in the literature. An instrument with seven items for measuring scientific creativity was developed and validated using item response data from three experts, 10 lecturers, and 60 pre-university students in Penang, Malaysia. Item analyses were performed to ensure content and face validity, followed by a reliability procedure in the measurement of stability through test–retest reliability. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.83 after two CSCT measures were taken over a two-month period, based on a comparison of the first- and second-time scores. This indicates an excellent relationship between the items in this test, and the items were found to be reliable and valid in assessing the scientific creativity of pre-university students. The CSCT instrument reported in this study will be utilised in the real study to test pre-university students’ scientific creativity in chemistry#FRE#
