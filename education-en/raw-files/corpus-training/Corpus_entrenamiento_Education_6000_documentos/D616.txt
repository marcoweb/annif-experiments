#ITI#Maximizing Learning Opportunities with Young Refugee Multilingual Learners in Urban Schools: An Asset-Based Participatory Action Research#FTI#
#IRE# This paper reports an asset-based participatory research study with 18 pre-service teachers and 85 refugee multilingual learners in an after-school program housed in an urban public elementary school. The research illuminates how the refugee multilingual learners (RMLs)’ backgrounds, assets, and challenges can be understood and transformed to maximize their learning opportunities. The findings provide a renewed perspective on RML students and alternative pedagogical approaches with the hope of improving their learning experiences and outcomes. The findings also call for continuous teachers’ professional training concerning RMLs’ diverse backgrounds, knowledge, and experiences. This paper concludes with a promising concept, cultural humility, in urban education research.#FRE#
