#ITI#Adopting and using geospatial technologies for teaching geography in Latin American higher education#FTI#
#IRE#The article presents the results of a regional study analysing the factors that predict Latin American faculty adoption and use of geospatial technologies (GST) for teaching geography. The research involved an online survey with 337 participants from 17 countries, who answered a set of items adapted from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology on five GST–desktop GIS, web-based GIS, remote sensing, GPS, and digital globes. The data was analysed using a structural equation modelling. The results confirmed that faculty who identified pedagogical benefits of using GST considered technologies as easy to master, and valued the opinion of people influential to them about using technologies were more likely to be motivated to use GST for teaching. In addition, faculty willing to use the GST and report adequate institutional conditions were more likely to be using the technologies for teaching. Additional statistical testing found that human geography faculty expressed an infrequent use of these technologies compared to their physical geography and geospatial technologies colleagues, who did report a more consistent use of GST. These findings suggest a divide among Latin American faculty regarding the motivation and institutional conditions to implement technologies, based on their field of expertise#FRE#
