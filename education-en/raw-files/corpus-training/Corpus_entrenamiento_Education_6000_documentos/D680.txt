#ITI#Encountering and contesting native-speakerism in Japanese universities#FTI#
#IRE# ‘Internationalisation’ in Japanese higher education (HE) is largely imagined in terms of English language acquisition. Native speakers of English are therefore desirable HE employees. However, ‘native-speakerism’ also reflects hierarchical notions of English language forms. In Japan, US and Anglo forms of English are privileged over others, which has uneven implications for English speakers employed in Japanese HE. In this paper, we discuss the findings of a qualitative doctoral study, conducted in 2015 and 2016, which involved interviews with 25 native English speakers working for Japanese universities. The study explored the interviewees’ experiences working in Japanese HE. Interviewees revealed that as so-called native speakers of English, they experienced a range of advantages in Japanese universities, but that their positioning also seemed to preclude institutional attention to their wider professional expertise. Participants’ narratives demonstrated how they sought to differentiate themselves from other native English speakers who were less qualified. We conclude the paper by considering the need for policies and practices in Japanese HE that acknowledge the diversity of ‘English speakers’, for example, by recruiting HE staff according to clearly defined skillsets (not just native speaker status) and developing internationalisation policies that move beyond English linguistic imperialism and native-speakerism#FRE#
