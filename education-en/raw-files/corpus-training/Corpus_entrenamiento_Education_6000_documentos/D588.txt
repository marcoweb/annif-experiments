#ITI#Children's Access to Books, Libraries, and Storybook Reading: Survey of Mothers at a Family Homeless Shelter#FTI#
#IRE# Access to books and storybook reading contribute to children's language, literacy and academic development. Homeless children often experience delays in these areas of development; however, their access to books and storybook reading is understudied. This study of 24 children in a family homeless shelter and 27 housed children in the same urban neighborhood found homeless children had fewer books, visited libraries less often, were unlikely to have library cards, and fewer were read to daily. Identifying these disparities has implications for reducing the inequalities and developmental risks often associated with childhood homelessness and associated challenges for schools that educate them.#FRE#
