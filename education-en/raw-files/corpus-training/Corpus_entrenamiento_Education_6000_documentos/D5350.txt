#ITI#Supervisors of International Occupational Therapy Students on Clinical Placement: Perceived Tensions and Hidden Expectations#FTI#
#IRE#This study aimed to explore supervisors’ perceptions of working with international occupational therapy students in Sweden. Learning in clinical placements abroad may be challenging for international students and supervisors. Yet, most research has focused on exploring students’ experiences of international programs and little has been reported from the supervisors’ perspective. A qualitative descriptive design was utilized. Six clinical supervisors recruited through one of the largest educational institutions in Sweden. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. The findings were categorized into four themes; “Balancing students’ expectations and formal learning possibilities”, “Navigating students’ need for understanding differences in resources, legislation, and other factors differing from their context”, “Acknowledging students’ different perceptions of dialogue and reflection”, and “Being aware of the impact of socio-cultural situations on students’ learning”. This study provides valuable insights that support understanding of cultural differences and expectations that could be applied to international students’ clinical practice#FRE#
