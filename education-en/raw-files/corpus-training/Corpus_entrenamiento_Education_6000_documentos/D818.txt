#ITI#From burden to benefit: a multi-site study of the impact of allied health work-based learning placements on patient care quality#FTI#
#IRE# Allied health clinical placements take place within an increasingly overstretched health care system where demand for services often exceeds availability of resources. Within this environment, student placements are often perceived as an additional burden to an already overwhelmed workforce. This study explored whether the quality of patient care was enhanced when services were re-designed using a collaborative partnership approach to more purposefully integrate students into delivery of care. Using an embedded multiple case study design, data were collected through focus groups and interviews, patient experience surveys, and secondary administrative data sources. Cases were across physiotherapy and occupational therapy in six different hospital settings. Perception of care provided by students was viewed positively by all stakeholders, including patients. Perceived health outcomes of faster improvement of health condition, improved mobility and function identified through our qualitative findings were supported by quantitative service delivery markers such as increased therapy sessions, more patients being discharged home instead of to other care facilities and reduced length of stay. Health care providers and students alike perceived improvements in service efficiencies whilst maintaining high quality care. This study has provided preliminary evidence towards improved patient care when a partnering approach is adopted whereby students are intentionally integrated into services that otherwise might not have been delivered. Furthermore, it has shifted the associated narrative from students as additional burden to students as benefit#FRE#
