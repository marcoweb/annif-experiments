#ITI#Development and Initial Validation of the Discrimination in Engineering Graduate Education (DEGrE) Scale#FTI#
#IRE#Engineering lacks quantitative measures of racism and sexism in engineering graduate education. Racial and gendered disparities in participation, persistence, and experience combined with qualitative evidence indicate that discrimination interferes with marginalized students’ well-being and degree completion. The Discrimination in Engineering Graduate Education (DEGrE) scale helps researchers identify environmental gender and race/ethnicity-based discrimination in engineering graduate education. The scale development and initial assessments reported here demonstrate the validity, internal reliability, and utility of the DEGrE subscales. The DEGrE scale will assist engineering colleges and departments evaluate their graduate students’ experiences to guide decision makers in identifying changes needed in their graduate programs to improve equity and inclusion of marginalized students#FRE#
