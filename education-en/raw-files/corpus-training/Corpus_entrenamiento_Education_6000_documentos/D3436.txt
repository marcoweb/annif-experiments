#ITI#Educational responses to the challenges of the COVID-19 global pandemic: online provision and its consequences for the social resilience of minority communities#FTI#
#IRE#Social resilience can be defined as the individual’s willingness to mobilise for the communal good, combined with the ability of societal institutions to both resist and adapt to changing conditions. Social resilience has become increasingly important as we respond to the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic poses to education. As individuals, we are expected to act for the communal good by wearing masks, following social distancing and allowing contact tracing. At the institutional level, education providers have responded to the current situation to a great extent by rapidly moving education online. However, online education provision has connotations which threaten the quality of education provision for minorities (ethnic, religious, and others). This paper looks at potential scenarios of online education disadvantaging minorities and suggests principles which can guide socially resilient education transformation in response to crises like the global COVID-19 pandemic#FRE#
