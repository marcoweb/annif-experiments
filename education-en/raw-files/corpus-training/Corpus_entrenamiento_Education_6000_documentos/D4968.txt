#ITI#Graduate Bridge Programs as Nepantla for Minoritized Students in STEM: Navigating Challenges With Non-Bridge Peers and Faculty#FTI#
#IRE#While research has documented the tremendous success of graduate-level Bridge programs for boosting thenumbers of minoritized students earning doctorates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics(STEM) fields, less is understood about the challenges participants face along their graduate journey whileparticipating in Bridge programs. Anzalduán concepts including nepantla frame minoritized STEM Bridgestudents’ experiences. This study included interviews with 29 student participants (the majority of whomwere African American or Latina/o/x1) and 19 faculty mentors or staff program coordinators drawn fromfive Bridge-to-the-Doctorate STEM programs. Participants described two key challenges: (a) othering bynon-bridge peers and (b) intense scrutiny by faculty and staff. Findings show that the presence of Bridgeprograms alone does not disrupt traditional norms and practices in STEM fields. Implications are discussedfor intentionally constructing graduate Bridge programs and supporting departments as they strive toimprove inclusion and equity within graduate STEM education#FRE#
