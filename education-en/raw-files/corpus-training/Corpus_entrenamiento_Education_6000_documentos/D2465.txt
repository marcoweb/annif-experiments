#ITI#Pre-service teachers enactment of language- and literacy-integrated science instruction in linguistically diverse science classrooms#FTI#
#IRE# The Next Generation Science Standards and increasing linguistic diversity of students in United States science classrooms require language-focused science instruction for which many secondary science teachers are not prepared. To date, minimal research has addressed how to best support secondary science pre-service teachers (PSTs) in teaching in linguistically diverse classrooms despite the fact that most PSTs will have the opportunity to teach emergent bilinguals (EBs) at some point in their careers. The purpose of this multiple case study was to determine at what level and in what ways three secondary science PSTs were able to integrate language and literacy into their science instruction following their participation in two language- and literacy-integrated science methods courses. PSTs' instruction was analyzed using an observation rubric and supported by instructional materials, interviews, and reflections. Results indicated that, following the intervention, PSTs were able to enact most language- and literacy-integrated science practices at the targeted level. However, the ways in which they did so varied and at times led to missed opportunities for EBs' participation in key scientific practices. Implications for teacher educators and researchers are addressed#FRE#
