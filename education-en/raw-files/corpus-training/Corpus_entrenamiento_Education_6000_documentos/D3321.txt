#ITI#More than English: Learning Design for Multilingual Learners#FTI#
#IRE#As more higher education institutions in the United States look not only to be designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) but to serve their student population in languages other than English, learning designers who are native speakers or have fluency in languages other than English are utilizing their language and cultural competencies to design courses. In this article, two graduate students in Colorado who are learning designers share their experiences as learning designers for a nascent certificate program in early childhood education in Spanish and also a translanguaging OER pilot project.
