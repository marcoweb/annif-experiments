#ITI#Equity Tank: A Model for Critical Inquiry and Change#FTI#
#IRE#While many student affairs departments are committed to addressing equity issues, they face limited capacity and lack institutionalized frameworks to implement equitable change at all levels on a cyclical and proactive basis. Equity Tank, a four-phase interactive model, allows all members of a department to question its policies, practices, and procedures to consider how they may negatively impact marginalized communities. Grounded in two practice models, the Equity Scorecard (Bensimon, 2012) and an Equity-Minded Inquiry graduate school assignment (Castillo-Montoya, 2015*), this model requires practitioners to develop and implement tangible recommendations to address inequities within their respective department#FRE#
