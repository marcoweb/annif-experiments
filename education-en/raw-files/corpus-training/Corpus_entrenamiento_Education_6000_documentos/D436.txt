#ITI#Black student views on higher education reparations at a university with an enslavement history#FTI#
#IRE# Research has yet to examine how Black undergraduates view various forms of university reparations for slavery. Using Critical Race Quantitative Inquiry and the Black Radical Imagination to ground the study, we explore Black undergraduates’ level of support for various forms of university reparations at a Southern university with an enslavement history. Findings from 92 Black students reveal wide support for various forms of university reparations, with greater support for more transformative measures. Additionally, the statistical model reveals that gender, racial ideology, support from faculty of color, and greater emotional responses to the university’s slavery history predict support for university reparations#FRE#
