#ITI#Direct and Indirect Impacts of Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten on Kindergarten Readiness and Achievement#FTI#
#IRE#Early Childhood Education (ECE) programs provide skills needed for successful kindergarten strides, especially for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. While Florida’s Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten (VPK) program currently serves most four-year-olds, some educators have questioned the program’s quality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the direct and indirect effects of Florida’s VPK program on kindergarten readiness and academic achievement for students attending the program in one county's VPK (CVPK) when compared to students who did not attend approved VPK programs in this county. The results suggest that, regardless of socioeconomic status, children who attended CVPK programs were just as prepared and performed equally as well in kindergarten as those who did not attend this program. Unfortunately, we cannot know how the CVPK program compared to specific pre-K alternatives without being able to distinguish program attendance across provider types (i.e., other ECE or no pre-K), which is something we recommend Florida begin tracking and make accessible#FRE#
