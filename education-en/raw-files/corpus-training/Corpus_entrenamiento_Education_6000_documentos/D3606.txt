#ITI#Researching belonging in the context of research with people with intellectual disabilities: A systematic review of inclusive approaches#FTI#
#IRE#Background: In disability studies belonging is emerging as a promising area of study. Inclusive research, based as it is on lived experience perspectives, is likely to provide salient insights into belonging in the lives of people with intellectual disabilities. Method: A systematic review utilising four databases and five leading journals in the field of intellectual disabilities was used. Content analysis and a deductive synthesis of the extracted data was undertaken. Results: A high level of confluence was found between the findings of the included studies and key themes of belonging identified in the wider literature. Beyond this, studies utilising inclusive research approaches have contributed novel findings about belonging in the lives of people with intellectual disabilities. Conclusions: Inclusive research approaches to belonging may provide innovative and responsive frameworks to support people to develop a sense of being connected and “at home” in themselves and in their communities#FRE#
