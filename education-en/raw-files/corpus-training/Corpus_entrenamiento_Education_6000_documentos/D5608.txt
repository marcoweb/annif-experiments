#ITI#Teaching conventional early reading skills to children with intellectual disabilities in special schools in the UK: a survey of current practices and perceived barriers#FTI#
#IRE#Statistics relating to special schools indicate very low rates of basic literacy. However, there is very little information available regarding typical instruction in these settings and, therefore, no clear picture of the potential barriers precluding the improvement of reading skills in special schools. The current paper investigated current practices in conventional early reading instruction (i.e., instruction involving the development of reading abilities using traditional orthography) with children in special schools and, in particular, children with intellectual disabilities. One hundred and ninety teachers participated in the survey, which aimed to: collate information on current practices related to conventional early reading instruction for children with intellectual disabilities in special schools across the United Kingdom (UK); investigate the putative effects of age and severity of intellectual disabilities on teachers’ choice of instructional approaches; and examine teachers’ perceptions of barriers to improving reading skills in this population. Age and severity of intellectual disability were associated with different responses relating to the choice of approaches and expectations. Access to training and suitable curricula were seen as greater barriers to improving reading skills than time or staffing#FRE#
