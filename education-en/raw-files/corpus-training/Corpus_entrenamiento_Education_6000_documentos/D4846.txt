#ITI#Psychometric Properties of the Persian Version of the Participant Role Scales in Bullying School#FTI#
#IRE#Bullying is a form of school violence that has recently received the attention of school psychologists. One of these problems that exists in almost all schools is the phenomenon of school bullying. The aim of this study is to examine the psychometric reliability and validity of the Participant Role Scale in bullying in Persian and compare the psychometric properties of 3- and 4-factorial models for this scale.We use both descriptive and inferential statistics. The statistical population was the second-grade students in Lorestan province in the year 2021–2022. Sample size of 617 students (324 males and 293 females) were selected by multistage cluster sampling. The range of Subscales Cronbach’s alpha coefficients varied from 0.8 to 0.91, and the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the whole scale was 0.90. The 3-factorial model had slightly better reliability than the 4-factorial model structure. Similarly, the factor structure of the 3-factorial model structure was much better in exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. We provide a reliable and valid 3-factorial model for the Participant Role Scale in Persian. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.#FRE#
