#ITI#Emotions, identity, and commitment among early leavers in the United States of America#FTI#
#IRE#High teacher attrition rates hinder schools in their ability to provide quality instruction. While studies have identified factors related to attrition (e.g., salary, administrative support) and the emotions of teaching, research is needed that explores the impact of emotions on teachers’ career decisions. This study examines the emotional experiences of leaving teaching early (within the first 5 years) in the United States through qualitative analysis of interviews with 25 early leavers. Findings reveal that the majority of participants, 23 out of 25, experienced negative emotions about leaving, including anger as well as guilt. For 15 participants, their experiences changed their identities as teachers, which, along with emotions and decreased commitment, help to explain why they left#FRE#
