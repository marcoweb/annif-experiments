#ITI#Infusing Restorative Justice Practices Into College Student Conduct Practices#FTI#
#IRE#The traditional model code administrative hearings at colleges and universities have not experienced substantial change in modern history. Karp and Sacks (2014) identify this as problematic as student learning is not being maximized. Additionally, Ryan and Ruddy (2015) found that this type of student conduct process does not allow for an individual to take responsibility and ownership for their actions. Furthermore, Schrage and Giacomini (2009) demonstrate inequities in disciplinary processes and outcomes for students of color when compared with their white peers. Restorative justice (RJ) is an emerging philosophy that could lead to higher student learning, support for all involved parties, and address systemic inequities. This practice brief examines the philosophy, history, practices, and pathways of RJ. With this understanding of RJ, the practice brief then offers higher education professionals a set of guiding principles to diverge from traditional model code administrative hearings toward practices infused with RJ#FRE#
