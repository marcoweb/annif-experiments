#ITI#The Search for Racially Diverse Schools: Understanding How a Diverse State Lacks Diverse Campuses#FTI#
#IRE# The purpose of this research is to examine the prevalence of racially diverse high schools in order to understand the conditions that create or inhibit the existence of diverse and equitable schools. We analyzed Texas state demographic data for schools in order to understand the scarcity of racially diverse campuses. We then utilized mapping and Critical Race Spatial Analysis (CRSA) to better understand the context, geography, and history that creates or eliminates space for diverse high schools. This work highlights the need for race-conscious policies around attendance, zoning, and choice programs that promote diversity and equitable practices.#FRE#
