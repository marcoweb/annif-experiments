#ITI#Approaches to studying: changes during a three-year undergraduate study program#FTI#
#IRE#Whether higher education students’ approaches to studying are amenable to change, is disputed. In this study, Norwegian occupational therapy students’ (n = 263) approaches to studying were assessed annually across the three-year course, with the aim of exploring changes during the undergraduate study program. Sociodemographic information and the Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students were completed. Changes during the follow-up period were analyzed using linear mixed models for repeated measures. A significant increase in deep approach scores and a decrease in surface approach scores during the study program was revealed. The strategic approach remained unchanged, but with a difference between education institutions. Overall, the study suggests that the students’ approaches to studying changed in a positive direction during the study program. Attention should be given to students at risk of adopting a surface approach to studying and to the individual and contextual elements influencing study behaviors#FRE#
