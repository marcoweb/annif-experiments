#ITI#Implementation and evaluation of the Model of the Use of Evolutionary Trees (MUET) curricular module in an introductory organismal biology course#FTI#
#IRE#The Model of the Use of Evolutionary Trees (MUET)-curricular module that systematically and comprehensively introduces the learning of evolutionary trees for the lower-level college students was developed and implemented in an introductory organismal biology laboratory course at a mid-size, doctoral degree-granting institution. A quasi-experimental, nonrandomised control group, pretest–posttest research design was used to assess students' improvement of their tree-thinking ability. In this study, the students in the MUET-curricular module were the experimental group (N = 174) and the students in the traditional curricular module were the control group (N = 170). Paired t-test results revealed a statistically significant increase in students' tree-thinking ability in the MUET-curricular module (t(173) = −4.38; p < 0.001). Wilcoxon signed rank test results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in students' self-reported perceptions of their tree-thinking ability in the cognitive dimension in the MUET-curricular module (z = −5.68, p < 0.01, r = −0.32). Results show that the MUET-curricular module can be used in the introductory biology contexts as an effective teaching resource in the teaching and learning of tree-thinking#FRE#
