#ITI#Pandemic pedagogies: reflecting on online learning using the community of inquiry framework#FTI#
#IRE#The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in profound disruption to geography higher education. A pivot to online teaching required staff to rapidly adapt their practices to novel digital spaces. Whilst many studies have reported the different pedagogic approaches adopted, fewer have evaluated the resultant student learning experience. In this study, we aimed to create an evidence base regarding the benefits and challenges of online learning during the pandemic, mapped against the teaching, cognitive and social presences of the Community of Inquiry framework. We adopted a mixed-methods approach of online surveys (105 students) and focus groups (14 students), undertaken across two undergraduate geography programmes in a British university, exploring the benefits of asynchronous and synchronous online learning, and assessment and feedback strategies. We discovered flexibility in student work patterns and use of technology to facilitate engagement in learning. We also identified key challenges for students such as time management, maintaining motivation, engaging in online classes, and feeling part of an online learning community. We identify best practice in collaborative-constructivist online learning, so that in the event of any future remote pivot, or with sustained adoption of blended modes of delivery, we can achieve a high-quality student learning experience#FRE#
