#ITI#Exploring the transforming nature of a mindfulness course#FTI#
#IRE#Increasing pressure and demands on students in higher education to perform and succeed has contributed to unprecedented levels of student stress, leading to poor academic performance and mental health. Universities are positioned to take proactive measures by creating environments that support student learning and minimise anxiety, such as incorporating mindfulness concepts. Previous research on mindfulness practice shows potential to benefit healthy people in the general population, yet few studies consider the environment in structured student experiences of learning mindfulness in higher education. In this qualitative research study, we explored the learning experiences of 58 students enrolled in a university mindfulness and well-being course, as to what factors they felt contributed most to their learning experience. Using thematic data analysis (Clarke & Braun, 2016) from weekly student responses to 3–5 qualitative questions, we generated themes from students’ course experiences that determined the establishment of a conducive learning environment. These experiential themes fit together as an archetype, a model we titled ‘Mindful University-Student Learning Community’ containing three sequential categories: 1) creating a safe learning environment; 2) transitional state; and 3) a community of mindful individuals. Our findings indicate that universities can implement mindful teaching practices that help to foster a conducive learning environment, supporting students’ psychological well-being and successful engagement with academic materials#FRE#
