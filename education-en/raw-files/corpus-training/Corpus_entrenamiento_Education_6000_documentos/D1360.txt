#ITI#Entangled eclecticism: a sociotechnical-pedagogical systems theory approach to learning experience design#FTI#
#IRE# This paper explores the adoption of an entangled eclecticism perspective in Learning Experience Design (LXD), integrating a sociotechnical-pedagogical systems approach. It emphasizes the significance of considering the sociocultural, technological, and pedagogical dimensions of learning as a cohesive, interconnected ecology to design effective learning experiences. The authors discuss the implications of this perspective on learning outcomes, methodologies, and the selection of relevant theories for design. The aim is to guide the creation of learning experiences that are not only effective, efficient, and appealing but also deeply empathetic, culturally sensitive, and responsive to the evolving dynamics of learning environments. Concluding that LXD is a complementary approach to traditional learning design, the paper underscores its evolution, drawing from multiple traditions to offer a holistic framework for educational design and technology. This approach strives for learning experiences that are not just effective and efficient, but also culturally sensitive and empathetic, adapting to the dynamic nature of learning environments. Broader implications of this approach and directions for future research are discussed. © Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2024. corrected publication 2024.#FRE#
