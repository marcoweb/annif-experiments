#ITI#Inclusive placement learning for diverse higher education students: anxiety, uncertainty and opportunity#FTI#
#IRE# There is an increasing policy emphasis on supporting diversity and inclusive practice, as well as graduate employability for higher education students. Work-based learning (WBL), placement learning, or work integrated learning (WIL) is a key component of many undergraduate degree programmes. However, for many students, factors such as disability, ill-health, caring or work responsibilities can impact on their placement experience. This paper presents research based upon students’ experiences and staff members’ views of placement learning. It offers a wider discussion of inclusion and inclusive practice that goes beyond a single focus on disability. Firstly, the paper addresses the challenges that a diverse range of students face when considering placement and then discusses the experiences of staff in support of this activity. These are conceptualised within the three themes of anxiety, uncertainty, but also opportunity. As researchers and reflective practitioners, the authors present discussion that aims to develop our understanding of inclusive practice, inclusive placement learning, and meeting the needs of diverse groups of students. These are universal requirements, relating to themes of social justice, reaching across different institutions, subject disciplines, and international boundaries#FRE#
