#ITI#A Culture of Innovation in Early Childhood Education: Which Factors Shape How Teachers Use Curriculum Innovation?#FTI#
#IRE#Curriculum innovation occurs throughout the early childhood education (ECE) sector. This article reports on the results of a survey conducted in Aotearoa New Zealand, during Phase 1 of a two-phase mixed-methods study. The research examines the factors that shape the way teachers use curriculum innovation and seeks to understand how teachers’ interactions with other teachers, families, and learners affect their innovative practices. In this study, 193 ECE teachers from throughout Aotearoa New Zealand responded to an online quantitative survey on these topics. The initial findings show that teachers’ innovation is informed by self-belief, relationships, and contextual factors, and how these all work to shape curriculum innovation. It is anticipated that this research will spark new thinking, new practices, and new collaborations across the ECE sector. Phase 2 qualitative case studies are currently underway across multiple locations in Aotearoa New Zealand. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
