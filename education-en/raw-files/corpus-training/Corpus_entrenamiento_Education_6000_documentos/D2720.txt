#IRE# Abstract: Individual interest and self-regulation are two pillars of self-directed learning. Despite empirical evidence on the interaction between the two with respect to academic achievement, few studies have explored how individual interest and self-regulation might interact and relate to self-directed informal learning. This study surveyed 322 university students on self-regulation and two interest constructs (interest in learning English and interest in pursuing personal interest in English), and tested how these factors related to their engagement in self-directed use of technology for English learning beyond the classroom. Structural equation modelling analysis revealed that despite both being significant determinants, interest factors, and self-regulation were associated differently with various types of self-directed technological activities (instruction-, information-, entertainment- and socialization-oriented activities). Self-regulation was predictive of instruction-, information- and socialization-oriented activities, which have high cognitive load and require effort management for second-language learners. Interest in English learning was consistently a significant predictor of all four types of technological activities. Interest in pursuing personal interest in English played a significant role in information- and entertainment-oriented technological activities. The findings recommend greater attention to individual interest when promoting self-directed informal learning. The findings further suggest adopting a differentiated approach to bolstering self-directed learning for different purposes. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Self-regulation is important to self-directed learning. Subject-matter interest and self-regulation interplay to influence academic performance in formal learning contexts. What this paper adds Interest and self-regulation interplayed to shape self-direction in informal learning contexts. Self-regulation was predictive of instruction-, information- and socialization-oriented activities. Interest factors added additional explanation power on self-directed technological activities. Both subject-matter interest and the integration of personal interest with subject learning were significant determinants. The integration of personal interest with subject learning mediated the influence of subject-matter interest. Implications for practice and/or policy Educational interventions need to work simultaneously on both interest and self-regulation to bolster self-directed learning. Educators need to address different factors when boosting different types of technological activities. A relative stance needs to be taken since self-regulation might play a less significant role in less taxing technological activities. It is important to deliberately integrate students' personal interests into English learning and help students perceive and act on the integration#FRE#
