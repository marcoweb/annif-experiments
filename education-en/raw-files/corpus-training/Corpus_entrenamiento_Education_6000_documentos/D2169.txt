#ITI#Revisiting online learner engagement: exploring the role of learner characteristics in an emergency period#FTI#
#IRE# This study aims to investigate the influence of learners’ characteristics on their engagement during online education due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigated learner characteristics included digital literacy, self-directed learning, motivation for learning, and perceived stress. The data were collected from the undergraduate learners and the proposed moderated mediation model was tested. The findings showed that all learner characteristics are significant predictors of online learner engagement. Besides, self-directed learning and motivation significantly mediate the relationship between digital literacy and engagement while perceived stress significantly moderates the relationship of digital literacy with self-directed learning, but not with motivation for learning#FRE#
