#ITI#Effect of the environmental factor of coexistence on the physical condition of people with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Background: The main objective of this study was to compare the physical condition of people with intellectual disabilities living in residential homes (RH; restricted residential environment) versus independent homes (IH; family houses while performing paid work). The effect of gender on physical condition was also evaluated separately for each group. Method: Sixty individuals with mild to moderate intellectual disability, 30 living in RH and 30 living in IH, participated in this study. The RH and IH groups were homogeneous in terms of gender distribution (17 males and 13 females) and intellectual disability level. Body composition, postural balance, and static and dynamic force were considered as dependent variables. Results: The IH group performed better in the postural balance and dynamic force tests compared to the RH group, but no significant differences between the groups were observed for any body composition or static force variable. Women in both groups tended to have better postural balance than men, while men presented higher dynamic force. Conclusions: The IH group presented a higher physical fitness compared to RH group. This result emphasises the need to increase the frequency and intensity of the physical activity sessions commonly programed for individuals living in RH#FRE#
