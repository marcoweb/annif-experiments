#ITI#Technological pedagogical content knowledge: Exploring new perspectives#FTI#
#IRE#Recognising the challenges involved in understanding the knowledge that teachers need to develop to use technology in their teaching dynamics, we examined the prior research that has not clearly revealed strategic changes for teacher preparation in the digital age. The goal was to expand on the current understandings of the nature of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK/TPACK) and provide a launchpad for future research by teacher educators as they contemplate revisions in the education of teachers to better prepare them for teaching in the digital age. To do so, we conducted qualitative meta-synthesis research. Within this context, we identified interpretations and comprehensions that pushed us forward in defence of new perspectives on the nature of this knowledge, regarding the comprehension of TPCK/TPACK as a transformative and homogenous knowledge; TPCK/TPACK’s levels of development, including a new first level; and the need for and challenges of redesigning teacher education. Implications for practice or policy: • To better prepare teachers to teach, teachers’ educators should understand TPCK/TPACK as a homogeneous and transformative knowledge. • Teachers’ training programmes should realize that often teachers are not aware of the of the possibilities of using technologies to teach. • Teachers should have access to continuous learning to keep developing their own TPCK/TPACK during their entire career. • Teachers and teachers’ educators should understand TPCK/TPACK developing as a continuous and individual process and not as something standardised. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
