#ITI#The Interdependency of Perceived Task Difficulty and the Choice Effect When Learning With Multimedia Materials#FTI#
#IRE# According to self-determination theory, both provision of choice and reduced task difficulty facilitate learners’ motivation via an increase in 2 basic psychological needs. This study examines the moderating role of the autonomy-changing effect of choice on the competence-altering effect of differences in perceived task difficulty in a multimedia learning setting. To measure this, 2 experiments (N1 = 108; N2 = 86) with secondary school (Experiment 1) and university (Experiment 1) students were conducted using a 2 (with a choice vs. without a choice of an additional topic before learning) × 2 (induced low vs. high perceived task difficulty) between-subjects design. While learners read texts about geographical data about Antarctica, 1 group was able to choose a subject matter of a second learning material’s content. Learning performance, judgments of learning, and cognitive and motivational processes after the first learning material were measured in both experiments, while Experiment 1 additionally measured perceived autonomy and perceived competence. Results showed that induced differences in perceived task difficulty did not yield learning differences. However, the autonomy-enhancing effect of choice moderated differences in perceived task difficulty. Overall, this experiment provides evidence for an interaction between possibilities of autonomy and competence support defined in the self-determination theor#FRE#
