#ITI#COVID-19 impacts on early career trajectories and mobility of doctoral graduates in Aotearoa New Zealand#FTI#
#IRE# This article explores how doctoral graduates in Aotearoa New Zealand are being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey captured the employment and mobility situations of doctoral graduates from 2019 to early 2021 from six of the eight universities in NZ. The 406 survey responses were analysed using descriptive statistics, as well as drawing on Cognitive Information Processing (CIP) theory in an inductive analysis of freeform comments. Most respondents were aspiring to academic careers, but the pandemic led to the loss of job offers for 19.2% and altered career plans for 60.6%. Family circumstances impacted career decisions for 21.4% and these were complicated by mobility difficulties with border closures and visa issues. The impacts of the pandemic on careers were significantly greater for international graduates. The qualitative analysis revealed themes of uncertainty, complications, pragmatism and academia. Using CIP, it is apparent that the pandemic has created a more complex job environment and heightened stress and anxiety over career and mobility options. As shown in our conceptual model, NZ universities need to better prepare graduates for the landscape of career possibilities, making students aware of their attributes, supporting their wellbeing, and helping them navigate the complexity of the current job environment#FRE#
