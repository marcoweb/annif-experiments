#ITI#Exploring the Relationship Between Surface Features and Explaining Quality of YouTube Explanatory Videos#FTI#
#IRE#Physics education research on explanatory videos has experienced a boost in recent years. Due to the vast number of explanatory videos available online, e.g. on YouTube, finding videos of high explaining quality is a challenging task for learners, teachers, and lecturers alike. Prior research on the explaining quality of explanatory videos on classical mechanics topics has uncovered that the surface features provided by YouTube (e.g. number of views or likes) do not seem to be suitable indicators of the videos’ explaining quality. Instead, the number of content-related comments was found to be statistically significantly correlated with the explaining quality. To date, these findings have only been observed in the context of explanatory videos on classical mechanics topics. The question arises whether similar correlations between the explaining quality and YouTube surface features can be found for videos on topics that are difficult to access visually and verbally, for example from quantum physics. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study analyzing the explaining quality of N = 60 YouTube videos on quantum entanglement and tunnelling. To this end, we made use of a category-based measure of explanatory videos’ explaining quality from the literature. We report correlations between the videos’ explaining quality and the surface features provided by YouTube. On the one hand, our results substantiate earlier findings for mechanics topics. On other hand, partial correlations shed new light on the relationship between YouTube’s surface features and explaining quality of explanatory videos#FRE#
