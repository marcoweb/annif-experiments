#ITI#Enablers and barriers to program-level assessment planning#FTI#
#IRE# Assessment underpins students’ learning in higher education and provides evidence of knowledge and skills. Program-level planning refocuses the assessment from being content and siloed at the course level to being program oriented with alignment to program learning outcomes and graduate attributes. Program-level assessment has been gaining momentum and shown to create positive assessment practices that support the quality agenda driving the higher education sector; despite this, program-level assessment is not widely adopted in Australian universities. This article explores the factors that academics in health and science programs identify as enablers and barriers to adopting program-level assessment. Grounded Theory was the methodological approach used to construct the semi-structured interviews with 18 Associate Deans and Program Directors from seven universities. Thematic analysis revealed the enablers and barriers to participants’ undertaking program-level assessment. The enablers of program-level assessment included having a shared responsibility through whole-team collaboration, effective leadership, and professional development. Conversely, barriers included resource constraints, ownership issues, and siloed practices, a lack of assessment literacy and university policies. The identification of these enablers and mitigating the barriers can help facilitate program-level assessment planning to enhance the assessment experience and drive students’ purpose of assessment within a university program#FRE#
