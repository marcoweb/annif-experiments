#ITI#Designing an international survey for organisations serving people with Down syndrome#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Down syndrome is the most common liveborn genetic condition. However, there are no surveys measuring societal services and supports for people with Down syndrome. We developed a questionnaire so that initiatives could be targeted towards countries most in need of assistance. Method: We formed a geographically diverse group of physicians, family members of people with Down syndrome, and members of Down syndrome not-for-profit organisations to create a survey of societal services and supports. We used a modified Delphi method and disseminated the survey to Down syndrome non-profit organisations worldwide. Results: Our survey consists of 61 items categorised within five domains: Education, Community Inclusion, Independence, Healthcare, and Social and Policy Issues. Conclusions: We developed a survey to measure societal services and supports available to people with Down syndrome as perceived by organisational leaders. Our methods might serve as a blueprint for other populations of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities#FRE#
