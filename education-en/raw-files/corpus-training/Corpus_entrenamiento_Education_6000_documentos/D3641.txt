#ITI#Behavioural activation for depressive symptoms in adults with severe to profound intellectual disabilities: Modelling and initial feasibility study#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Almost no research has been published reporting on evaluations of the effectiveness of psychological interventions for people with severe to profound intellectual disabilities and depression. This paper describes the development and initial feasibility testing of an adapted Behavioural Activation therapy (BeatIt2) for this population. Method: Phase 1 of the study examined participant recruitment and willingness to be randomised in the context of a planned Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT). Phase 2 examined the feasibility of delivering the intervention. Results: Twenty adults with a severe or profound intellectual disability and clinically significant depression were recruited to Phase 1 of the study. In Phase 2, there was 100% participant retention for those recruited to the study at 6-month follow-up. The BeatIt2 therapy was reported to be acceptable for participants. Conclusion: COVID disruption meant that it was not possible to complete the planned feasibility RCT. The positive findings suggest that additional evaluation of BeatIt2 is warranted#FRE#
