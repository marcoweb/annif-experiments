#ITI#Leveraging cultural forms in human-centred learning analytics design#FTI#
#IRE# In this article, we offer theory-grounded narratives of a 4-year participatory design process of a Learning Analytics tool with K-12 educators. We describe how we design-in-partnership by leveraging educators' routines, values and cultural representations into the designs of digital dashboards. We make our long-term reasoning visible by reflecting upon how design decisions were made, discussing key tensions and analysing to what extent the developed tools were taken up in practice. Through thick design narratives, we reflect upon how cultural forms—recognizable cultural constructs that might cue and facilitate specific activities—were identified among educators and informed the design of a dashboard. We then examined the extent to which the designed tool supported coaches and teachers to engage in Generative Uncertainty, an interpretive stance in which educators manifest productive inquiries towards data. Our analysis highlights that attuning to cultural forms is a valuable first step but not enough towards designing LA tools for systems in ways that fit institutionalized practices, challenge instrumental uses and spur productive inquiry. We conclude by offering two key criteria for making culturally-grounded design decisions in the context of long-term partnerships. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Participatory design can invite stakeholders to directly inform the creation of LA artefacts that fit their needs, context and cultural markers. What this paper adds Cultural forms can be identified and leveraged in the design of LA tools. HCLA scholars ought to design for systems—the complex body of organizational routines, cultural practices and interactions among multiple stakeholders—and not just for users. Implications for practice and/or policy Leveraging cultural forms in LA needs to be accompanied by a critical view of which practices, behaviours, values and structures are suggested by such forms. Designing features that are easy to use, are associated with concrete tasks, and fit into existing cultural practices are three criteria for embedding cultural forms into LA design#FRE#
