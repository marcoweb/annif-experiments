#ITI#Investigating the Knowledge Domains Science Teachers Use When Considering a Socioscientific Issue#FTI#
#IRE#In an increasingly complex media environment, science educators must help prepare students to make decisions on science-related issues that are in the best interest of themselves and their communities. Researchers have suggested the use of socioscientific issues (SSI) to teach students how to think scientifically and to make good decisions regarding science-related issues. To support students in their learning, growth, and thinking when considering SSI, it is helpful to know how people think about SSI. Understanding the knowledge domains that people draw from when considering SSI will help researchers and teachers support students in their thinking and decision-making regarding SSI. Many studies have looked at how people use individual knowledge domains, but few have looked at multiple knowledge domains in concert. This study investigated the knowledge domains that secondary science teachers use when considering a regional SSI. Participants were interviewed using a think-aloud protocol, in which they read an article about an SSI and were asked to verbalize their thinking about the issue. Findings indicate that participants in our study drew most often from the domains of media literacy and the nature of technology (NOT). We suggest that such domains deserve more attention than they have received in science classrooms if students are to be more fully prepared to engage with SSI#FRE#
