#ITI#Investigating English-medium instruction for international students in China#FTI#
#IRE#Few studies have investigated current English-medium Instruction (EMI) programmes for international students studying in universities in China’s mainland. The present study applies Spolsky’s language policy framework to analyze Chinese EMI programmes in terms of language ideology, language management, and language practices on the national level, the university level and the individual level. Data are collected from policy statements, interviews, and questionnaires. This study finds that in EMI programmes for international students, language belief lays the foundation for meso-level language management. Guided by macro beliefs, meso institutions use the management tools of curriculum design, instructional staff management, and evaluation to implement EMI programmes. Language practice is influenced by and modifies beliefs and management. In practice, professional learning is prioritised, and a slight mismatch between the language support provided by the institutions and international students’ actual expectations is found. This study contributes to the development and implementation of EMI in Chinese higher education#FRE#
