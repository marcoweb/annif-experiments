#ITI#Socially shared inquiry with media and information literacy teachers: gaps and ways forward#FTI#
#IRE# This paper explores the teachers’ collective constructions of Media and Information Literacy (MIL) and examines several gaps and ways forward in implementing the curriculum. Consistent with the participatory and self-reflexive framework of Socially Shared Inquiry, the researcher conducted focus group workshops with seven MIL teachers from select public senior high schools in the Philippines. The findings provide insights into the teachers’ media experiences that correspond to their view of essential components and competencies of MIL. Institutional issues and challenges were elicited and analyzed, enabling the teachers to propose several solutions to these salient issues. These recommendations offer practical implications for the enhancement of MIL education, including the curricular reform that lends itself more to learning about media, and a needs-based professional development of MIL teachers. It is hoped that the findings would resonate with MIL researchers and practitioners in terms of examining how MIL is operationalized in various contexts#FRE#
