#ITI#DIF Detection With Zero-Inflation Under the Factor Mixture Modeling Framework#FTI#
#IRE# Response data containing an excessive number of zeros are referred to as zero-inflated data. When differential item functioning (DIF) detection is of interest, zero-inflation can attenuate DIF effects in the total sample and lead to underdetection of DIF items. The current study presents a DIF detection procedure for response data with excess zeros due to the existence of unobserved heterogeneous subgroups. The suggested procedure utilizes the factor mixture modeling (FMM) with MIMIC (multiple-indicator multiple-cause) to address the compromised DIF detection power via the estimation of latent classes. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the suggested procedure in comparison to the well-known likelihood ratio (LR) DIF test. Our simulation study results indicated the superiority of FMM over the LR DIF test in terms of detection power and illustrated the importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity in zero-inflated data. The empirical data analysis results further supported the use of FMM by flagging additional DIF items over and above the LR test.#FRE#
