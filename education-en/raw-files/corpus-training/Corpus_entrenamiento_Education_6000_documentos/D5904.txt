#ITI#Experiences of distance doctoral supervision in cross-cultural teams#FTI#
#IRE#In distance cross-cultural supervision scenarios PhD students are supported by supervisors located in different cultural contexts, which may, or may not be, the same as that of the student. Very little research has been conducted into experiences of cross-cultural supervision. This paper aims to explores opportunities and challenges for students and supervisors, drawing on qualitative research into their experiences of supervision. Participants were Saudi Arabian students, and UK and Saudi based supervisors. Investigation of three main areas–roles and expectations, communications and technology, and personal and professional development–revealed common issues, and some specific to either students or supervisors. These include language, feedback, technology and professional learning and align with ‘intensifiers’ identified as making supervision complex or difficult for international PhD students. However, other issues were also identified which need to be discussed openly to ensure that the potential benefits of cross-cultural supervision are realised#FRE#
