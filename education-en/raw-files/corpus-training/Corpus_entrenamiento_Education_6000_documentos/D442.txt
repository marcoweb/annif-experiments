#ITI#Outsider in the academy: experiences and perspectives of Caribbean women attending predominantly White institutions in the southeastern region of the United States#FTI#
#IRE# Most studies on international education focus on Asian or European student experiences. This typically ignores the perspectives of African-descent international students. To that end, this phenomenological study examines the experiences of Afro-Caribbean international women pursuing graduate degrees at Predominantly White Institutions [PWIs] in the U.S. Using Black Feminist Post-Coloniality as a theoretical framework, this study antagonizes the role of race and gender within international student experiences. Participants of this study reveal feelings of being an ‘outsider’ in the academy, as described by isolation, unwelcoming environments, and stereotyping. Results of this study reveal imperative needs within higher education reform and international student support, especially in relation to race and gender#FRE#
