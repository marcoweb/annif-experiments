#ITI#Culturally Relevant Education as a Professional Responsibility#FTI#
#IRE# Despite substantial evidence of the effectiveness of—and the need for—culturally relevant education (CRE), it has been treated by many schools as a professional choice or new initiative rather than a fundamental approach to teaching in a multicultural, democratic society. Moreover, efforts to implement CRE across schools and districts have recently been met by strong opposition from well-organized groups. In this essay, the authors point to scientific, legal, and ethical arguments for why CRE should be considered a noncontroversial, evidence-based approach to education. The authors then draw on insights from political psychology and critical Whiteness studies to argue that the opposition to CRE is unlikely to be overcome through the evidence they present. The arguments therefore are meant not to convince critics but rather to bolster educational leaders’ resolve to stand strong in the face of opposition. The authors conclude with specific recommendations for how districts might begin the work of institutionalizing CRE so that the approach ultimately becomes taken for granted and alternatives cease to be considered#FRE#
