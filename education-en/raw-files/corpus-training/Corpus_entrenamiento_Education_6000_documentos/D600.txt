#ITI#Cultivating Asset-, Equity-, and Justice-Oriented Identities: Urban Field Experiences of Elementary Preservice Teachers of Color#FTI#
#IRE# I examine how three elementary-level preservice teachers of Color cultivated their asset-, equity-, and justice-oriented pedagogical learning and identities through multilayered community-engaged tasks. Systemic and structured support from multiple stakeholders played a critical role in helping the preservice teachers of Color to promote and sustain their asset-, equity-, and justice-oriented pedagogical learning and identities. This study demonstrates that giving students tasks with multiple modalities (e.g., individual and collaborative work, face-to-face meetings, online reflections) can cultivate their pedagogical learning and identity construction. This work has implications for creating asset-, equity-, and justice-oriented pedagogical spaces in both the classroom and the field.#FRE#
