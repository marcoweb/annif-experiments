#ITI#How Learners Use Their Hands for Learning: an Eye-Tracking Study#FTI#
#IRE# The present work reviews and summarizes results of tracing studies up to the present and collects different explanations for found effects of pointing and tracing while learning as an effective touch-based action method. Two explanations are focused finally in order to test them in the presented eye-tracking study. The study (N = 90) with a three-group experimental design investigated whether learners benefit from pointing compared to learners using tracing or no-touch-based action method (pointing vs. tracing vs. no touch). The results replicate previous findings demonstrating benefits of using the hands for learning and provide additional support for the hypothesis that fingers support learning by directing attention. This is due to the fact that the learning group using pointing outperformed, especially in comprehension performance, the no-touch learning group and the learning group that used tracing actions. Eye-movement analysis indicated that the pointing group profited from a higher focus of visual attention and more intense cognitive activity. The question of why the tracing group did not show this same benefit is discussed by considering previous studies and the limitations of the present study. It seems as if the present study does not replicate a previous study. However, when reflecting on the different control group design, the present study delivers additional information on how using fingers affects learning. Moreover, new perspectives with explanations from the review are integrated for interpreting and discussing the presented results and opened herewith for further research on touch-based actions in the frame of movement and learning#FRE#
