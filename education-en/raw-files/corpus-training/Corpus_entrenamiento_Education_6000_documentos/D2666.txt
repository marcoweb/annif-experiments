#ITI#The effects of physical fidelity and task repetition on perceived task load and performance in the virtual reality-based training simulation#FTI#
#IRE# This study aimed to examine how the levels of physical fidelity of controllers (high, mid and low) and task repetitions (four trials) influence undergraduate students' perceived task load and performance in an immersive virtual reality (VR)-based simulation. The simulation was developed using the Unity 3D engine. VR controllers were developed to reflect a real power tool in three fidelity levels: high (most realistic: weight and tactile engagement), mid (tactile engagement without weight) and low (control group: only controller). The tasks were designed to reflect complexities with four working postures: no walking & standing up, no walking & bending over, walking & standing up and walking & bending over. Thirty-six healthy undergraduate male students participated in the study. Participants were instructed to complete motor tasks accurately. Audio feedback (drill sound) and haptic feedback (vibration) were activated for three groups when the controller and a screw made contact. Each participant used all three fidelity controllers and repeated the four tasks in a counterbalanced order to account for order effects. The results of a one-way repeated measures MANOVA indicated that two dimensions of task load were significantly different among the three physical fidelity conditions. Also, task completion time, inaccurate operation time and inaccurate counts were significantly shorter when four tasks were repeated. The study findings provide design implications for VR-based training experiences for future workforce development. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic VR training simulations offer immersive opportunities for skills development, creating interactive and visually appealing learning environments. VR training simulations employ VR controllers as interactive interfaces to enhance task performance in virtual environments. Consideration of physical fidelity is crucial to improve simulation realism and support realistic sensory input for user interaction and tool manipulation. High physical fidelity in VR training simulations enhances immersion, realism and task performance. What this paper adds We developed a VR controller that emulates the physical characteristics of a power tool, including weight and tactile feedback. We investigated the impact of different levels of physical fidelity on VR training simulation. This research demonstrates that the level of physical fidelity in VR training simulations influences learners' task load. Through multimodal data analysis, we examined learners' task load and performance during repeated power tool tasks, illustrating the relationship between physical fidelity and task load. Implications for practice and/or policy Our findings suggest that adjusting the physical fidelity of the VR controller effectively modulates the learner's task load in task complexity and perceptual strain. We emphasize the importance of repeated training supplemented with precise instructional guidance, such as the integration of visual cues, to enhance performance and promote skill development#FRE#
