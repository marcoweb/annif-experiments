#ITI#Dynamics and impacts of internationalisation on curriculum and instruction in higher education#FTI#
#IRE#This study aims to understand the dynamics and impacts of internationalisation on curriculum and instruction in higher education in the UAE. Employing a quantitative questionnaire for students and qualitative questionnaire for staff, the research was conducted across selected higher educational institutions situated in DIAC. Quantitative data underwent statistical analysis, while qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. The results derived from the quantitative data underscore a robust acknowledgement of the significance of internationalisation among higher education students in the UAE. However, they also reveal noteworthy gaps in awareness of this phenomenon. The results from the qualitative data shed light on potential and practical avenues to enhance the impacts of internationalisation on curriculum and instruction within higher education in the UAE. The study contends that internationalisation has yielded positive effects on curriculum and instruction in higher education in the UAE. These effects could be further optimised through pertinent strategies#FRE#
