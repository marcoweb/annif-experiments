#ITI#Differences between CLIL and non-CLIL students: motivation, autonomy and identity#FTI#
#IRE#This article aims to contribute to the explanation of why bilingual education (CLIL) may reduce the differences in motivation and English proficiency commonly seen between students from different SES backgrounds (Shepherd and Ainsworth 2017). From a mixed-methods approach involving a questionnaire and focus group interviews, fourth year Secondary Education students in the Community of Madrid (Spain) were asked about their views on education, teachers, classroom practices, and their use of English outside the classroom. Results reveal significant differences in the way that students from bilingual schools and those from non-bilingual schools see their schooling experience (what they value in teachers and schools) as well as how often they speak English outside of school. This may be explained by the nature of students’ motivation in each case, which may, in turn, be influenced by the schools’ characteristics. Further research is needed as to whether bilingual schools are inherently more autonomy-supportive learning environments#FRE#
