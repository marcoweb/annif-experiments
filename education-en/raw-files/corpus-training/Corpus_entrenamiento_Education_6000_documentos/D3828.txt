#ITI#When Seeing is Believing: A Framework for Reflective Conversations in Remote and Face-to-Face Coaching Approaches#FTI#
#IRE#Reflective conversations between teachers and coaches are critical to helping teachers improve their classroom instruction. Coaches who encourage teachers to “see, think, and do” are better able to facilitate meaningful reflective conversations with teachers. The “See, Think, Do” framework consists of six steps (observe, describe, process, analyze, draw conclusions, and plan) that can be used to help coaches engage in reflective conversations with teachers. The framework can be readily implemented in remote and face-to-face coaching modalities and in one-on-one and small group delivery formats. Suggestions and strategies for implementing the framework in ongoing coach-teacher conversations are provided#FRE#
