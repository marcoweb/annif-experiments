#ITI#The psychopathological profile of children with specific learning disorders: the point of view of children and their mothers#FTI#
#IRE#Individuals with Specific Learning Disorders (SLD) are at risk of increased psychological distress, such as internalising (e.g. anxiety) or externalising (e.g. aggressive behaviour) symptoms. This study investigates the psychopathological profile of children and adolescents with SLD from their point of view and the point of view of their mothers. The sample included 98 mother-child couples, with children having a single identified disability area (e.g. only dyslexia) or multiple disability areas. Children having SLD presented a higher than expected (based on the normal distribution) percentage of clinically relevant and borderline scores in internalising symptoms, as well as in the DSM-oriented scales of affective, anxiety, and somatic problems, ADHD and oppositional defiant problems; rates of symptoms were higher in mothers’ reports. More symptoms of ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder were reported for children with multiple learning disability areas, and more internalising symptoms were associated with dyscalculia. These results highlight the presence of both internalising and externalising symptoms in individuals with SLD, with stronger difficulties observed by mothers compared to children themselves. Also, having multiple learning disability areas in comorbility and having dyscalculia could be risk factors for more severe psychopathology in children with SLD; this information could guide clinical work#FRE#
