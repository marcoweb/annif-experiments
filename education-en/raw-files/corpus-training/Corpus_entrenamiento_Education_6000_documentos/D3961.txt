#ITI#Hybrid language as a tool for enhancing involvement in learning a biochemistry process: a self-study#FTI#
#IRE#Helping preservice teachers use hybrid language representations in science is important if they are to become scientifically literate and able to engage in the discourse for understanding scientifiyc issues. Using hybrid language representations based on the framework of computer-supported collaborative learning, the teacher educator applied the 5Es instructional model to conduct a scientific literacy inquiry. The goal was to promote 13 PSTs’ understanding of the Krebs cycle in a biochemistry course, using the representational language of emojis which is common in the Z generation’s social interactions, to engage their attention and facilitate their understanding of the complex biochemical process. Although the PSTs demonstrated that they understood the relationship between the specific reactions in the Krebs cycle, there was no evidence that they could generalise this mode of thought and representation to other biochemical inquiry topics. Nevertheless, the study provides insight into the ways the use of the 5Es instructional model enhanced PSTs’ motivation, interactions, and involvement during collaborative learning and acknowledges the vital role of a self-study#FRE#
