#ITI#Building Culturally Situated Relationships with BIPOC Children Through a Communal Ethic of Care#FTI#
#IRE#The landscape of how to best prepare minoritized young children for the uncertainties of an inequitable American society demands a change in the way we view the connection between early childhood educators’ lived experiences and their pedagogy. Using the theoretical frameworks of critical race theory, Black feminist thought, and intersectionality, the purpose of this narrative inquiry was to examine how five Black women early childhood educators’ lived experiences inform their use of culturally relevant pedagogy to enact a communal ethic of care with students in pre-k to third grade. This study took place at an elementary public charter school serving students in pre-kindergarten to third grade in the southeast sector of Fort Worth, Texas. Data were collected through individual semi-structured interviews, sister circle collective gatherings, Photovoice, and researcher produced life notes. Data was analyzed using Polkinghorne’s narrative mode of analysis to produce life story narratives. This inquiry’s findings demonstrated how these educators (re)membered their culturally situated work in early learning spaces. Each woman navigated the intersections of her identity to build meaningful relationships with young children and families. Implications for early childhood educators, administrators, educational researchers, and teacher educators are offered along with recommendations for future research. Through witnessing the lives of Judy, Mimi, Bobbi, Scarlett, and Krys, I learned that the answer to achieving abolitionist educational goals lies in the implementation of a communal ethic of care. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
