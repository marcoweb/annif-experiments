#ITI#An Overview of Community Cultural Wealth: Toward a Protective Factor Against Racism#FTI#
#IRE# Community cultural wealth (CCW) as an asset-based framework challenges the deficit notion that Communities of Color do not possess “cultural” capital. Here, we adapt CCW as a framework that can help Students of Color navigate PK-20 educational contexts, particularly when experiencing interpersonal and structured racism, such as racial microaggressions. We begin by discussing the conceptual origins and intent of CCW. Next, we provide an overview of research studies that exemplify Students and Faculty of Color accessing CCW. Finally, by framing racism as an everyday risk factor, we consider how CCW can be used as a protective factor when experiencing racism.#FRE#
