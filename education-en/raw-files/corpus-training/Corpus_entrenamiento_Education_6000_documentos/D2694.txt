#ITI#A visual learning analytics approach for knowledge building: Impact on students' epistemic understanding of discourse, productive inquiry and domain knowledge#FTI#
#IRE# In this study, we examine the design process for a visual learning analytics (VLA) approach in addition to its effect on developing students' epistemic understanding of discourse and relationships to promote knowledge-building inquiry. Over a 3-month period, an experimental class of secondary school students took a visual arts course using a knowledge-building design augmented by VLA, while a comparison class took the same course within a regular knowledge-building environment. The VLA approach implemented in the experimental class emphasized collective reflections using assessment tools to visualize the students' online and classroom discussions. The analysis of the students' questionnaire responses and Knowledge Forum discourse showed that the VLA approach helped the students develop a deeper epistemic understanding of discourse for productive inquiry and greater domain knowledge. In addition, the students' epistemic understanding was associated with their performance in productive Knowledge Forum inquiry. Qualitative analysis of the classroom and group discussions, interview responses and learning artefacts showed that the VLA design helped them understand the nature of discourse deeply by encouraging them to notice community orientations, increase their awareness of productive discourse moves and advance idea development. The implications of the VLA design in improving epistemic understanding of discourse are discussed. We contribute to the literature by examining the epistemic dimensions of discourse and implementing VLA as an epistemic tool for knowledge building. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Supporting students to develop a meta-level understanding, ie, their epistemic understanding of the nature of discourse, is important for promoting productive inquiry but continues to be challenging in education, and limited research has focused on the epistemic aspects of discourse. Little research has examined the role of a computer-supported knowledge-building environment augmented by a visual learning analytics approach on students' epistemic understanding of discourse, productive inquiry and domain knowledge. What this paper adds A knowledge-building design augmented by a visual learning analytics approach linking online and face-to-face discourse supported students' epistemic understanding of discourse, productive inquiry and domain knowledge. VLA-supported collective reflection in knowledge-building facilitated students' noticing of community orientations, awareness of productive discourse moves and their idea development. These metacognitive processes helped students develop deeper epistemic understanding of discourse, productive inquiry and greater domain knowledge. Implications for practice and/or policy Epistemic understanding of the nature of discourse acts as a medium for promoting productive knowledge-building inquiry and learning outcomes, and it is critical to help students develop meta-level understanding by combining discourse content and epistemic components. It is important to create a VLA-supported community that provides VLA-related data-supported collective reflection opportunities to help students engage in productive inquiry and knowledge building. Teachers can scaffold students to link online and face-to-face discourse and help them inquire into and reflect on discourse processes#FRE#
