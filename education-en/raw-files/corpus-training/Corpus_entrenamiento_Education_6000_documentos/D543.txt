#ITI#Disrupting School Rituals#FTI#
#IRE# Integrating the theories of Michel Foucault and Erving Goffman, this article presents a theoretical and empirical analysis for conceptualizing school classrooms as ritualized spaces that shape the roles, relationships, and interactions of students and teachers. This analysis is then used to examine the impact of one urban classroom that employed new classroom rituals to disrupt the traditional practices and performative roles of students and teachers. The article argues that disruptive rituals play an important role in efforts to transform patterns of social interactions in urban classrooms.#FRE#
