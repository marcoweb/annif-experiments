#ITI#Hybridizing Motivational Strains: How Integrative Models Are Crucial for Advancing Motivation Science#FTI#
#IRE# This special issue was motivated by the realization that student motivation is inherently complex and no single framework can capture it in its full richness. However, the current zeitgeist in educational psychology seems to explicitly discourage attempts at integration as researchers are incentivized to stay within their own theoretical camps. In this special issue, we asked seven research teams to revisit their theoretical assumptions and cross-fertilize their own theories with other frameworks. We also invited three distinguished luminaries to critique and comment on this undertaking. We highlighted key issues that prevent cross-fertilization of ideas across theoretical borders, surfaced potential dangers associated with naïve integration, and proffered future directions that could nudge motivation science towards a more cumulative and integrative approach.#FRE#
