#ITI#To what extent does distance learning support the development of positive attitudes towards inclusive education: a comparison of primary education trainee teachers in England and Türkiye?#FTI#
#IRE#This study examines how distance learning, which took place during COVID-19 restrictions, influenced the attitudes of primary education trainee teachers in Türkiye and England towards inclusive education for students with special educational needs and disabilities. In total, 136 Turkish, and 25 English primary trainee teachers completed the TAIS survey, and a further, 14 Turkish and two English trainees, participated in semi-structured and scenario-based interviews. The quantitative data showed that both countries’ trainees’ attitudes level were high, but English trainees` attitude were more positive than the Turkish trainees. However, the qualitative data indicated that the absence of direct, practical experience was a major concern, and most felt the need to gain direct experience starting from their first year of teaching about inclusive teaching practices#FRE#
