#ITI#A Practice-Based Approach to Learning Nature of Science through Socioscientific Issues#FTI#
#IRE#The nature of science (NOS) has been recognised as an essential component for engagement with socioscientific issues (SSI). However, the findings on the link between the two have been inconclusive. This calls for a shift from students merely knowing about NOS, to using their understanding of it as a tool for decision-making and participation in debates about SSI. This study set out to devise and implement a practice-based SSI intervention programme (12 weeks) and to examine its effect on students’ use of NOS understanding and multi-perspective evaluation of SSI. The participants were 110 undergraduate students with different majors. Data were collected through questionnaires, reflective tasks and follow-up interviews. The programme improved students’ use of NOS understanding and multi-perspective evaluation of SSI. Statistical analyses of pre- and post-course performance revealed a significant shift to the use of NOS understanding, in particular the social aspects of the sources of information (p <.00001). Explicit teaching on the development of NOS understanding and its use, hands-on practice across contexts, peer interactions and emphasis on a layperson’s perspective were found to account for the change. These findings support a change in practice in learning about science and offer empirical support to the call for a shift from students’ merely knowing about NOS, to actively applying their understanding of it#FRE#
