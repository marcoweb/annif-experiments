#ITI#Activating student engagement with concept mapping: A Web GIS case study#FTI#
#IRE#With the increasing availability of web mapping application programming interfaces, those tasked with the job of developing and designing web-based geographic information systems (Web GIS) are faced with the question of how to (re)develop new and existing capabilities. While Web GIS often reproduces features currently available within desktop GIS, usage requirements often demand it be both easier to use and more specific in its purpose. As GIS has become more integrated with evolving web technologies, many semantic ways in which GIS functions depend on specific user interactions (UX) where underlying functions are abstracted to user interfaces (UI). Our study explores the utilization of concept maps to facilitate learning about Web GIS within the context of an online graduate GIS course. Specifically, our project involves a case study that illustrates the following: 1) a design and implementation of having students create concept maps as part of the learning process around building custom Web GIS; 2) a discussion of how an instructor can approach the assessment of student-built concept maps; 3) an illustration of how student-build concept maps can encourage student interaction specific to course content#FRE#
