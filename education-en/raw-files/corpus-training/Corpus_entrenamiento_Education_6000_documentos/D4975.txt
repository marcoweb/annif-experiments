#ITI#The Theoretical Engagements of Scholarship on LGBTQ+ People in Higher Education: A Look at Research Published Between 2009 and 2018#FTI#
#IRE#Using a content analysis approach, this study examined how scholarship on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning (LGBTQ+) people in higher education used theories to advance knowledge about these communities between 2009 and 2018. Guided by the concept of thinking with theory, the article explores the varying relationships that scholars developed between data and theoretical/ epistemological traditions. In particular, the research project had a specific focus on how scholars mobilized critical and poststructural frameworks to shape literature on LGBTQ+ people. Findings revealed several important trends. Namely, there was a significant omission and lack of naming of epistemological foundations in research on LGBTQ+ people. Additionally, studies employing critical and poststructural frameworks increased during this period of time. Although the epistemologies represented in scholarship grew, few articles explicitly mentioned how their chosen theories/ epistemologies informed every aspect of their study design. Implications for future research and practice are offere#FRE#
