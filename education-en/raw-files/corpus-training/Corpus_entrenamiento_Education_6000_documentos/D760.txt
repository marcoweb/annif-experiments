#ITI#Expectations for PhDs in health professions education: an international EPA-framed, modified Delphi study#FTI#
#IRE# Health professions education (HPE) has matured into field of study that employs and produces specialized educational scholars. Many academic institutions employ such scholars to support development and innovation in education. Simultaneously, the possibilities to obtain a PhD degree in HPE are expanding. Clarity in the expectations that such a degree brings along can be useful for scholars, employers and institutions. Anticipating that the views of what a PhD in HPE is or should be can vary between institutions, cultures and countries, we conducted an international Delphi study to identify EPAs for HPE PhDs. We used a framework of 24 EPAs resulted from a national consensus study in Iran as input to seek more generalized validity and a wider consensus of reasonably suitable activities. A three-round modified Delphi study was conducted with participation of 15 international experts. Final framework consisted of 17 relevant EPAs with a justification, specifications and limitations, and risks in case of failure per EPA (all had overall CVI > 0.8 for adequacy of description). Eleven EPAs were considered by the majority to be core to PhD training, 16 to be desirable for HPE PhDs as a capability to carry out without supervision, but the majority would trust current HPE PhDs to carry out only 5 of the 17 without supervision. The EPAs identified in this study arguably reflect the expectations of educators with a PhD degree in HPE. The framework has the potential to advance HPE training across countries and to inform personal development and employment decisions#FRE#
