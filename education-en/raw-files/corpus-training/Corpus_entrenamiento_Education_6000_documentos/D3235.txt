#ITI#Effects of Two Modes of Digital Storytelling Instructional Strategy on Pupils' Achievement in Social Studies#FTI#
#IRE#The teaching of Social Studies seems to have primarily depended on teaching methods that are deficient in using digital technologies to improve pupil achievement. This study explored the effects of two modes of Digital Storytelling instructional strategy (TPS-Collaborative and CVB) and moderating effects of gender and age on pupils' achievement, using a pre-test, post-test, control group quasi-experimental design, subjected to ANCOVA. The study involved intact classes of 88 participants from three government-owned elementary schools (4th grade) in three districts in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study tested four hypotheses at 0.05 levels of significance. Results showed that the treatment had a significant main effect on pupils' achievement while gender, age, and the 3-way interaction effect did not. The study concludes that digital storytelling is an effective strategy for enhancing pupils' achievements. Thus, teachers should adopt digital storytelling strategies for Social Studies instruction to enhance achievement regardless of age and gender#FRE#
