#ITI#Facility Dogs in Educational Programs for Young Children: Definition, Rationale, Issues, and Implementation#FTI#
#IRE#A facility dog in a school is a comparatively recent category of working dog. These dogs typically are trained at the assistance, or service dog, level and are thoroughly prepared for their role. The school facility dog accompanies an owner/handler, who is a professional employee of the school, to work on a regular basis. Research on human-canine interaction indicates that positive interactions between young children and dogs can improve learners’ academic performance, their attitudes toward school, the relationships they build with others, and their emotional wellbeing. This article begins with a definition for a facility dog, describes an exemplary dog training program that prepares facility dogs for schools, and explains the interprofessional partnerships that are essential for success. Next, we review the research to provide a rationale for bringing children and dogs together in educational contexts. The remainder of the article guides educators in planning for the facility dog’s arrival and involving the facility dog in a wide range of activities that support the school’s mission and goals#FRE#
