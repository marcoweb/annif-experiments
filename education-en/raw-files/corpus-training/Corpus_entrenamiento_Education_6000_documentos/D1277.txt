#ITI#AppleTree system for effective computer-supported collaborative argumentation: an exploratory study#FTI#
#IRE# Nurturing twenty-first-century competency is one important agenda in this era, especially in developing collaborative learning and critical thinking skills. Yet, facilitating such a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment is challenging. Although several technological platforms from past research studies were developed to support collaborative learning, having a system that comprises a collaboration script, and graph-based workspaces to facilitate explicit externalization of cognitive processes, at the same time, armed with learning analytics to monitor the collaboration and cognitive processes is rare. In this paper, the AppleTree system is presented to illustrate three unique features. Firstly, the AppleTree system is designed with a graph-based workspace to facilitate explicit externalization of knowledge co-constructions and argumentation. Secondly, the system is embedded with a four-phased switch to structure the CSCL process. Thirdly, the system possesses real-time learning analytics, including contribution counts, social network analysis, and the learning artifacts’ argumentation structure to promote the development of arguments. An exploratory case study was conducted to examine the design of the AppleTree system in an authentic classroom. Empirical findings showed that the AppleTree system helped regulate effective collaboration and supported learners in developing strong arguments. These results could address the social participation and interaction issues related to collaborative learning and enable the development of students’ argumentation skills. The implications of the study to educational technology and the CSCL research field are discussed#FRE#
