#ITI#Assessing Applicants in Context? School Profiles and Their Implications for Equity in the Selective College Admission Process#FTI#
#IRE#Profiles describing a high school’s quality and composition are one component of the undergraduate admission application to selective colleges, offering admission officers insight into a student’s academic environment. This study explores alignment between the data admission officers seek in a profile to support their holistic evaluations and the information profiles contain. Drawing on semistructured interviews with 25 admission officers and a content analysis of 100 school profiles, the study identifies 14 key components of a profile but finds that 43% of high schools incorporated fewer than nine of these elements into their documents. Using social worlds theory as a lens, the study explains how the profile’s status as a boundary object facilitates misalignment in its content. A purveyor of school contextual data, school profiles are designed to promote diversity within the admission process; this study illustrates how some profiles can constrain the ability of admission officers to make informed decisions, and thus may inadvertently perpetuate, rather than ameliorate, inequity#FRE#
