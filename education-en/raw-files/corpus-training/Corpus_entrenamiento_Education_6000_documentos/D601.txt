#ITI#A Post-Ferguson Spatial Analysis of Black Resistant and White Fortressing Geographies#FTI#
#IRE# This study explores the contrasting racialized geographies of St. Louis County and factors of local college accessibility by re-framing the concepts of college deserts and oases post the Ferguson uprising. Through a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of educational divides, capital accumulation, and policing, we found dual spatial landscapes: a geography of Whiteness and higher education capital accumulation in southern St. Louis and a predominantly Black working-class geography of Ferguson in northern St. Louis. These dual landscapes capture the social, economic, and racial contexts of St. Louis as it informs the discourse of college-going.#FRE#
