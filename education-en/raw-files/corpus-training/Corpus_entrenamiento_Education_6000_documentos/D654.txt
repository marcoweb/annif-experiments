#ITI#Priority setting in higher education research using a mixed methods approach#FTI#
#IRE# Setting priorities for higher education research is essential to maximise limited resources. Our study aimed to identify priorities for higher education research at one large research-intensive Australian university. A sequential three-phase mixed methods study was conducted. Phase 1 engaged 69 students, academics, and professional staff in an anonymous qualitative online survey to identify their perspectives on priorities. These qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis and the findings were then converted to a quantitative online survey (phase 2) that engaged 187 students, academics, and professional staff to determine the top priorities and the reasons for their choices. Descriptive statistical analysis of phase 2 Likert scales and rank order of priorities revealed the top three priorities from 39 priorities: (1) understanding how to engage students in learning; (2) understanding how to teach creative and critical thinking skills; and (3) understanding how to promote resilience, wellbeing and student connectedness. In phase 3, five focus groups with 19 participants affirmed these ratings/rankings. Our study is the first to identify research priorities for higher education to our knowledge, and may be used to focus future higher education research strategy#FRE#
