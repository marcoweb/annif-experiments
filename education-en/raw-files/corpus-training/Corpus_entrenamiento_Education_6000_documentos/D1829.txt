#ITI#The incorporation of peer learning into MosoTeach-supported flipped language class: Effects on student motivation, participation, feedback and test performance#FTI#
#IRE# Background Study: As flipped learning is a flexible pedagogical methodology to tailor students' needs and maximize the learning effects, this study integrated peer learning with MosoTeach-supported flipped mode in an undergraduate blended EFL course. MosoTeach is a popular online learning platform in China with a variety of learning resources. Objectives: The study aimed to test the impact of MosoTeach flipped learning (MTFL) mode on undergraduate EFL students' perceived motivation, participation, feedback, and test performance. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was carried out in Z university during the spring semester of 2020, with the experimental group (n = 34) adopting the MTFL model and a control group (n = 33) the non-flipped mode. Results and Conclusions: The independent t-test results showed that the experimental MTFL group outperformed the control group in post-test scores, and a positive correlation was found in the relationship between the experimental MTFL group's post-test scores and MosoTeach learning experience points (LEPs). Moreover, the course perception questionnaire survey indicated a higher level of students' perceived motivation, participation, and feedback in the experimental MTFL group, which corresponded to the results of the content analysis of students' responses to open-ended questions and reflective reports. But students in both groups experienced challenges such as isolation, procrastination and technological anxiety#FRE#
