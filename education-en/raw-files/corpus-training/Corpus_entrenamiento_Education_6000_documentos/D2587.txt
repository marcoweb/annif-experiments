#ITI#Development and validation of an instrument to measure online assessment acceptance in higher education#FTI#
#IRE# Many educational institutions have adopted online assessment in recent years. Previous studies on online assessment have often been tied to studies on learning management systems. As such, questions of online assessment acceptance have typically been overshadowed by a focus on the acceptance of learning management systems in general. The focus of the present research on online assessment is relatively rare. This paper describes the validation of an instrument to measure online assessment adoption by lecturers in higher education. A total of 213 participants responded to a 20-item online questionnaire. With the data collected and the model fit, the instrument developed was able to meet the expectations to measure online assessment. The preliminary evidence of the validity of the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model, based on its reliability found in the current study, supports the use of the instrument as a technology acceptance framework for online assessment systems. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model has been found to be a reliable and robust model to study and explain technology acceptance and use across various educational contexts. In the UTAUT model, performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI) and facilitating conditions are direct determinants of user acceptance and use behaviour. Subsequent validation by Venkatesh et al. (2003) in a longitudinal study found that the UTAUT model was a competent model that explained the relationships between PE, EE, SI and user behavioural intention (BI). What this paper adds An extended UTAUT model has been proposed, with the removal of EE as many UTAUT studies have shown that its influence has not been as consistent as compared to that of the other original constructs. In its place, constructs such as usability and learnability have been added as potential influences on both BI and use behaviour. Attitude as a construct has been added, as this was first included in an earlier Technology Acceptance Model but absent in the original UTAUT model. Development of a validated instrument suitable for assessing educators' acceptance of online assessment based on the extended UTAUT model. Implications for practice and/or policy The instrument proposed in this study can be used as a tool to examine educators' perception on online assessment. The instrument can also be used as a tool to inform educational institutions the factors that influence the successful implementation of online assessment or assessment-related systems. Based on its reliability found in the current study, this study supports the use of the instrument as a technology acceptance framework for online assessment systems#FRE#
