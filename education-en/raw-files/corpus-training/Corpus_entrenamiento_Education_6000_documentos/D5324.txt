#ITI#Evaluating Whether Flipped Classrooms Improve Student Learning in Science Education: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis#FTI#
#IRE#This study aims to determine the effectiveness of flipped classrooms in science education through the use of systematic review and meta-analysis. A total of 64 studies were analyzed by scanning the following databases: Web of Science, Eric, Taylor & Francis, and Education Full Text (EBSCO). Of the studies analyzed, 18 were selected for meta-analysis. Since the first study publication in 2013, the use of flipped classroom method in science education has since become prevalent. This study reveals that quantitative approaches were used as a principal research method, university students were preferred as primary participants, and that the studies reviewed mainly examined classrooms in the context of chemistry courses. As a result of meta-analysis, a meaningful effect size pertaining to student achievement was revealed, which showed favor towards the use of flipped classrooms (Hedges’ g = 0.625, 95% CI [0.342, 0.908], p < 0.001)#FRE#
