#ITI#Striving to cope: The quest for social justice in initial teacher education in Uruguay#FTI#
#IRE#This research project sought to comprehend how a group of graduates from an Initial Foreign Language Teacher Education (IFLTE) programme in a national teacher education college in Uruguay constructed a personal stance towards social justice as a result of having completed a curriculum intending to promote such a stance. Data were collected through document analysis, a survey, and semi-structured interviews. Results disclosed an inherent difficulty in graduates’ efforts to construct such a stance. Findings also seem to indicate the need for a reconsideration of the curriculum experience, particularly. This implies not only reconfiguring the curriculum, but also repositioning social justice at the theoretical and practical levels#FRE#
