#ITI#Makerspaces: Building Confidence in STEM for Primary Preservice Teachers#FTI#
#IRE#‘Design and Technology’ has been propelled into the spotlight with the popularity of the idea of ‘STEM’. So much so that it is now common for primary schools to have ‘STEM classrooms’ or makerspaces. Whilst there has been an increasing exploration of the use of makerspaces, there has been limited research on the impacts, particularly with pre-service teachers (PST), who are known to lack confidence in STEM-related subjects. Therefore, in this research, we explore how different aspects of makerspaces may influence PST confidence. Participating PST worked in small groups in the Uni Makerspace to design a product as part of a formal university assessment in a primary education Science subject. The case study design includes four groups of PST and data from interviews, observations and artefacts. Results outline confidence development amongst PST with several key Makerspace influences identified, including the importance of learning to use sophisticated equipment and the key role played by the Makerspace facilitators. Implications for Makerspaces and STEM education are discussed, including the potential to leverage the ‘novelty effect’ of Makerspaces, and the need to offer extensive support, particularly in the early stages of engagement. © The Author(s) 2024.#FRE#
