#ITI#Adaptive scaffolding and engagement in digital game-based learning#FTI#
#IRE# Educational games are becoming increasingly prevalent. Recently, adaptive game-based learning to accommodate diverse learners has received considerable attention. The current study aims to explore the effect of adaptive scaffolding from a multidimensional engagement perspective. A total of 61 students from a Taiwan secondary school studied Newton’s laws in a computer-based interactive game environment. The students were assigned to either a fixed scaffolding group or an adaptive scaffolding group to test the effect of adaptive scaffolding. The findings suggest that adaptive scaffolding can have a significant effect on students’ learning performance and engagement. The study offers significant implications for the design and integration of adaptive scaffold to promote learning engagement in digital game-based learning#FRE#
