#ITI#Computer says no? Limitations of tech-focused transitions to higher education for Australian LSES students#FTI#
#IRE#This article explores the limitations of technology-focused teaching and online learning in ‘widening participation’ tertiary preparation programs, from the perspective of non-traditional university students, and in their own words. Specifically, the article draws on data derived from the Life Literacies academic preparation and action research project which was designed to enhance the capacity of students from low socioeconomic (LSES) backgrounds to successfully undertake undergraduate study at a regional Australian university. Reflecting on this data, as an action researcher and critically reflective practitioner, I argue for a more human-centred and holistic approach to teaching LSES students in widening participation programs. This approach does not overestimate the potential of computer-mediated learning, but provides embedded digital literacy support through positive, supportive social relationships. What enabling educators need, is not ever more complex communications technologies, but the time, through-care and people skills to be authentically and consistently available and present for their non-traditional students#FRE#
