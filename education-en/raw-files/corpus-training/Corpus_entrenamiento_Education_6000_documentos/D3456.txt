#ITI#Freirean dialogic action in Brazilian public schools: a Lesson Study contribution to teacher development#FTI#
#IRE#Recalling Freire's lessons on education and teacher development, this study embraces the transformative power of dialogue. In the context of Brazilian public schools, where education faces challenges such as rigid curriculum prescriptions, the researchers implemented a Lesson Study cycle as a dialogic teacher development intervention. Despite constraints, it fostered a collaborative and dialogic space, enabling English teachers to share and reflect in formative interactions. This approach allowed for critical discussions, empowered teacher agency, and enhanced the quality of English teaching. Inspired by Freire's vision, dialogic Lesson Study proved to be a liberating experience for teachers, promoting active and meaningful practices#FRE#
