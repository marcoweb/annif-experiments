#ITI#What Happens When Training Goes Virtual? Adapting Training and Technical Assistance for the School Mental Health Workforce in Response to COVID-19#FTI#
#IRE#The Northwest Mental Health Technology Transfer Center (MHTTC) provides workforce training and technical assistance (TA) to support evidence-based school mental health practices. Historically, this support targeted school professionals through in-person and online trainings, workshops, and coaching. However, in response to COVID-19 restrictions, all support moved to online formats, and the Center introduced trainings for families and caregivers. The purpose of this article is to present preliminary process and outcome data that compare the reach and impact of support before and following COVID-19-related restrictions. Results suggest that transition to online support resulted in a wider reach and a more diverse audience, with no decrease in trainee satisfaction and perceived impact. Furthermore, families and caregivers reported positive gains in knowledge and behaviors following participation in a virtual youth suicide prevention training. Together, these findings suggest that online training and TA can provide tangible benefits to professionals and family members who support student mental health#FRE#
