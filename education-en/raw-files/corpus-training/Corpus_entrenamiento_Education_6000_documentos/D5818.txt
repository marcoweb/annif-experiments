#ITI#We all need to be water protectors: diversity, the environment, and social and environmental justice picturebook themes and portrayals#FTI#
#IRE#This paper describes a methodological review of over 2,000 picturebook descriptions and 60 picturebooks published within five-and-a-half years relating to diversity, the environment, social justice, and environmental justice portrayals. The authors asked in particular: To what extent is environmental justice portrayed in recent picturebooks, and how might these portrayals be problematized to understand better and share children’s literature? The data revealed that picturebooks portray social and cultural diversity more than environmental topics, and environmental justice portrayals comprise about 3% of the picturebooks surveyed. Picturebooks portraying environmental justice are new, and what is considered environmental justice is expanding. The authors also suggest an expanded notion of environmental justice called Stewarding and Relational Justice. These books incorporate themes of kindness and inclusive action toward each other and the earth, which build toward understanding and depictions of environmental justice. Lastly, the authors provide a curated list of recommended environmental justice and earth-centric books#FRE#
