#ITI#Developing an Evaluation Rubric for Planning and Assessing SSI-Based STEAM Programs in Science Classrooms#FTI#
#IRE#This multi-phase study designed a program evaluation rubric which used a qualitative rating system to help teachers identify key learning goals, dimensions, and principles related to the socio-scientific issues (SSI)-based science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) approach for science education. This rubric contains 37 criteria that address one or more key principles of the SSI-based STEAM approach embedded in a 6E inquiry-based instructional model. It is organised into seven evaluation categories: (1) learning outcomes, (2) engage, (3) explain, (4) explore, (5) elaborate, (6) evaluate, and (7) enact. The newly developed rubric was used to evaluate six different climate change programs to determine whether it could measure the intended dimensions and principles and to assess its applicability across varying contexts. This research has implications for providing a tool for teachers to plan and design SSI-based STEAM programs#FRE#
