#ITI#Test anxiety: Is it associated with performance in high-stakes examinations?#FTI#
#IRE#A long-established literature has found that anxiety about testing is negatively related to academic achievement. Yet there remains some debate as to whether this is simply due to less academically able pupils being more likely to develop education-related anxiety issues. This paper presents new evidence on this matter, focusing upon how test anxiety–as measured by five questions included in the PISA 2015 survey–is related to the grades 15/16-year-olds achieve in England’s high-stakes GCSE examinations. I find little evidence that teenagers with low or high levels of test anxiety achieve lower GCSE grades than pupils with average levels of test anxiety. Thus, in contrast to much of the existing literature, no clear relationship between test anxiety and examination performance is found#FRE#
