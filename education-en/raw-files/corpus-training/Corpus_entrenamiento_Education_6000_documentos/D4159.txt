#ITI#Developing a geographies of sport module using an active blended learning approach#FTI#
#IRE#This article reflects on the author’s experience of developing a standalone geographies of sport module that is taught using an active blended learning (ABL) approach. The article argues that an ABL pedagogy is an effective way of teaching meaningful sports geography to undergraduate students. It discusses how the approach allows a diverse range of relevant topics to be included, incorporating both “human” and “physical” geographies, and enables a personalised approach to learning. Teaching the geographies of sport provides students with opportunity to cement and enhance their understanding of fundamental geographical concepts whilst applying them to sports case studies that can be adapted to the interests of the student cohort. That is not to say that teaching of sports geographies comes without challenges, and this article reflects on some of those encountered. Most significantly, how to ensure that the module content is appropriate for final-year undergraduates as the body of dedicated geographical literature on sport is still comparatively limited#FRE#
