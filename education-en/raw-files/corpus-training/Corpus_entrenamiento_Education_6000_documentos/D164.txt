#ITI#Universal Design for Learning: When Policy Changes Before Evidence#FTI#
#IRE# Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a scientifically validated framework that has been included in policy like the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 and the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. However, studies have pointed out the variability in definitions and implementation surrounding UDL. In order to clarify this conversation, researchers collected and analyzed the narratives of experts in the origination and research of UDL. Nineteen experts participated in semi-structured interviews that examined definitions of UDL, its critical components, and identified priorities within the framework. Findings resulted in five themes. Implications for future research, policy, and practice are offered.#FRE#
