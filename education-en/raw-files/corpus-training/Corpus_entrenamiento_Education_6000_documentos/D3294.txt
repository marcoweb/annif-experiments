#ITI#Video Education through the Lens of Educational Neuroscience: A Concise Review#FTI#
#IRE#To further enhance the understanding of video education, researchers have started leveraging neuroscientific approaches to investigate the underlying cognitive processes and their correlation with learning outcomes. This concise review begins by examining recent behavioral studies that focus on teachers, students, and video media within the video education context. The findings from these studies provide valuable insights into the overall paradigm and design. Moreover, this review explores the potential of single-brain research and the emerging multi-brain scanning approach to shed light on the neural mechanisms involved in video learning. Current research has mostly used electroencephalography (EEG) to detect different brainwave frequency changes when single learners watch videos, as well as functional magnetic resonance or EEG to discover the extent to which the coupling of brain activity between instructional subjects in video-based instruction predicts learning outcomes. These novel approaches hold great promise in determining the cognitive processes implicated in video education and may eventually lead to more personalized and effective learning methods. By synthesizing the current state of research, this review aims to contribute to the ongoing discussions in the field and inspire further investigations into the neuroscientific aspects of video education. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2024.#FRE#
