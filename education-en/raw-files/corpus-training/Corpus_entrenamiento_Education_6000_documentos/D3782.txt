#ITI#Reading to Dogs at Home: A Pilot Study#FTI#
#IRE#In summer 2021, during the coronavirus pandemic, 8 parent-child dyads were recruited to participate in a pilot project to investigate the potential benefit of an at-home adaptation of an Animal-Assisted Intervention (AAI) for literacy. After completing a demographic survey and the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (Cohen et al., 1983), children’s reading level was established using the Fry method and past report card information. Parents were given access to an online levelled-reader e-book provider along with written instructions and video training. Parent-child dyads engaged in the at-home AAI literacy support for 6-weeks during which time children’s reading level was tracked online. Parental stress was assessed again upon completion. Findings indicate that reading level increased in 6 out of 8 cases, although not significantly. Parental stress, however, increased significantly from the start to end of the project. This descriptive pilot project discusses the potential and pitfalls of an at-home AAI literacy intervention#FRE#
