#ITI#Location and locational capital: an examination of factors influencing choice of higher education applications by working-class students in a sixth-form college#FTI#
#IRE# This paper explores the differential ways that working-class sixth-form students in England utilise cultural and social capital when applying to university. This process is examined in terms of the university and course choices made and associated social advantage and prestige. It employs an interpretive paradigm using qualitative methods and a conceptual framework derived from Bourdieu. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were employed and a grounded approach to data analysis was utilised. Findings suggest that access to cultural and social capital is limited to familial influence and educational environment had a limited impact on student decisions. When making choices the most notable themes linked to general locality. Locational preference linked to degree of geographical cultural knowledge and led to the development of the notion of locational capital. This corresponded to intentions to avoid certain locations such as “the rural” or “the provincial” and helps to understand choice. These geographical constructions, linked to perceptions concerning Higher Education Institutions, often triggered concerns regarding “fitting-in” and “social class” and for many resulted in limitations on choice. This imposed a limitation on applying to prestigious HEIs#FRE#
