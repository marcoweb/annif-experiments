#ITI#Constructivist gamification environment model designing framework to improve ill-structured problem solving in learning sciences#FTI#
#IRE# This study is focusing on synthesizing the theoretical and designing framework of constructivist gamification environment models to enhance ill-structured problem solving in learning science. The research model used is based on model development (phase 1) proposed by Richey & Klein. This research consists of two phases as follow: (1) to analyze and synthesize the theoretical framework; (2) to synthesize the designing framework of the constructivist gamification environment model to enhance ill-structured problem solving. The findings of the theoretical analysis shows that the theoretical framework is built upon four main pillars: psychological, pedagogical, technological, and problem-solving bases. Synthesizing the design framework of a development model is based on the findings of theoretical analysis. Five cognitive aspects make up the designing framework: (1) the stimulation of cognitive structure and encouragement of problem solving; (2) the support for cognitive equilibrium; (3) the support for enlarging cognitive structure; (4) the enhancement of ill-structured problem solving; and (5) the support for knowledge construction. The constructivist gamification environment model consists of seven components, namely: (1) the problem base; (2) the learning resource; (3) the cognitive tools; (4) the collaboration; (5) the problem solution; (6) the scaffolding; and (7) the coaching#FRE#
