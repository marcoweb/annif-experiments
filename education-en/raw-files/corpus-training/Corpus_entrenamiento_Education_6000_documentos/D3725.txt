#ITI#The impact of grit on the academic buoyancy of Filipino undergraduate students engaged in distance learning#FTI#
#IRE#Previous studies have revealed that academic buoyancy, or everyday academic resilience, have become more important amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study was conducted to ascertain if determination and passion for attaining long-term aspirations, or grit, would facilitate the academic buoyancy of Filipino undergraduate students who are engaged in distance learning. Through quota sampling, 114 Filipino college learners (57 males, 57 females) aged 18 and above were recruited to complete an online survey which included the Triarchic Model of Grit Scale (TMGS) and Academic Buoyancy Scale (ABS). Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that grit had a positive impact on academic buoyancy while controlling for demographic variables. It was also identified that the grit dimension of adaptability to situations was the most significant predictor of academic buoyancy and that the demographic characteristics of the participants were not associated with their capability to cope and stay afloat on a day-to-day basis. The results provide interesting insights about the relationship between the triarchic model of grit and academic buoyancy in the collectivist setting#FRE#
