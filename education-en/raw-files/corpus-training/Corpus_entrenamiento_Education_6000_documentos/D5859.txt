#ITI#Demolishing the fear of theory to liberate higher education discourse and practice#FTI#
#IRE#Educational discourse constantly demonstrates a cursory dichotomous view of knowledge in which positivism and relativism are contrasted, a condition which almost unavoidably results in favorable references to relativism. The difficulty lies in the objective qualities of knowledge being associated with positivist absolutism, which brings about fear of theory in terms of risking subjective thought and individual freedom. The present analysis attempts to demolish the fear of theory through methodological, grounded theory-based, illustration of the inclusion of objectifications in the interplay between teacher and students. It concurrently demonstrates how theory is inherently linked with practice and draws attention to conceptual learning. The goal is emancipatory: it is hoped that this illustration enables practitioners to evaluate their adherences to dichotomous discourse that can make pedagogies appear as confusing enterprises. The final conclusions propose a link between grounded theory-based conceptualization and reflection#FRE#
