#ITI#Examining K-12 educator experiences from digital citizenship professional development#FTI#
#IRE# Digital citizenship refers to exhibiting responsible digital habits to function in a digital world. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to examine K-12 educators' experiences based on a digital citizenship graduate-level course that they participated in for professional development. Forty-five educators participated in this course. In addition to the knowledge and attitudinal data collected from assessment and survey, ten educators also participated in follow-up interviews at the end of the course. Results indicated that educators’ digital citizenship knowledge increased significantly over the course period. Qualitative data indicated educators could transfer the course content to their school environments and enrolled in the course due to personal, student-related, curriculum-related, and school-related reasons. Needs and challenges regarding digital citizenship were also identified#FRE#
