#ITI#Perceptions of Cultural Diversity among Pre-service Teachers#FTI#
#IRE#The present article examines how a group of Norwegian pre-service teachers of English and other foreign languages perceived the term “cultural diversity” when student-centred learning activities were used. A qualitative inquiry, comprising data retrieved from three student-centred activities: student narratives, role-playing, and focus group discussion are thematically analysed. Theoretical concepts from translation theory are applied to discuss students’ perceptions of cultural diversity. The translation of the term in the student-centred learning activities led to individual and collaborative reflection in which controversial connotations and ethical dilemmas were debated. In the student narratives, conventional connotations were appraised; however, differing aspects were emphasized. When role-playing was used, the students’ interpretations were more emotive. The students tended to cast the role of teacher in the majority cultural position, thereby impeding the possibility to view the term in a wider perspective. In the focus group discussion, the students’ multifarious comprehensions regarding cultural diversity were debated#FRE#
