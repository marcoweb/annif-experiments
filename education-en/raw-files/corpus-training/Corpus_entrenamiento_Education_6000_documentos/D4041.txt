#ITI#How to incorporate theory in (urban) field trips: the built environment as concrete abstraction#FTI#
#IRE#Classroom teaching and field trips are both conventional ways of teaching geography in higher education. But where the former can be highly theoretical and abstract, the latter is rather practical, empirical, and concrete. In this paper, I argue there is a need to better incorporate theory into field trips. I seek to explore relations between theory and field trips both theoretically and practically. Theoretically, I draw upon Henri Lefebvre and Bertell Ollman and argue for seeing the built environment as concrete abstractions. Based on interviews with teachers, theoretical reflections, and, not least, personal experiences, I end the paper offering practical steps towards better combining theory and field trips#FRE#
