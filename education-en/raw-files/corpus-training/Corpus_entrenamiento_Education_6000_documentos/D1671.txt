#ITI#Mapping gender networks of music self-concept and music emotions: A network analysis study of music majors in China#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Students' music self-concept and music emotions are becoming prominent topics within the area of music education. Aims, Samples and Methods: The majority of previous research on self-concept and music emotions has examined the two constructs independently and focused on gender differences in externalizing behaviours in music learning, but has neglected the internal interactions between individual music self-concept and music emotions. Network analysis is a promising method for visually examining music self-concept and music emotions as part of a network of interactions to identify core features and interrelationships among nodes in the network. In this study, 515 students majoring in music from a Chinese university were recruited. Results: The results showed that high music self-concept and boredom were the common features at the core of the network for both men and women college students. The boredom exhibited by women differed from that of men in that men's boredom was directed at the entire music course, while boredom in women manifested as daydreaming and boredom with learning materials. Conclusions: This study is the first to explore gender differences in the music self-concept and music emotions from a holistic perspective. The findings could help music teachers gain insight into the complex system of music self-concept and music emotions. Music teachers could capture the respective features of men and women to design individualized teaching strategies#FRE#
