#ITI#The Relationship Between Varying Levels of Online Enrollment and Degree Completion#FTI#
#IRE# This study examines the influence of varying levels of online enrollment on community college students’ likelihood of degree completion, with a particular focus on completion outcomes among traditionally underserved subgroups of students. Using institutional transcript data from a high-enrollment community college and a propensity score weighting approach, I find that lower levels of online enrollment have a positive relationship with the likelihood of degree completion for Black, Hispanic, and low-income community college students, but enrolling in all online courses has a negative influence on the likelihood of degree completion across subgroups of community college students#FRE#
