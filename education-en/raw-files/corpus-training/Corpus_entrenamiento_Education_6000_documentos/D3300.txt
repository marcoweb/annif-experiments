#ITI#Can ChatGPT Pass Graduate-Level Instructional Design assignments? Potential Implications of Artificial Intelligence in Education and a Call to Action#FTI#
#IRE#This article investigates an artificial intelligence language model, ChatGPT, and its ability to complete graduate-level instructional design assignments. The approach subjected ChatGPT to a needs, task, and learner analysis for a 12th-grade media literacy module and benchmarked its performance by expert evaluation and measurements via grading rubrics. Initial results show ChatGPT’s ability to write graduate-level instructional design assignments but with some challenges and frustration in the bot's ability to customize for location and school-specifics. Key benefits of the findings include new ways to challenge instructional design students, faculty customization of future assignments, and the potential of AI as a collaboration tool in the instructional design and educational process#FRE#
