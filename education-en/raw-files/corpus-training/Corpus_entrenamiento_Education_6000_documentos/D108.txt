#ITI#Bullying and cyberbullying: a bibliometric analysis of three decades of research in education#FTI#
#IRE# Bullying is a topic of international interest that attracts researchers from various disciplinary areas, including education. This bibliometric study aims to map out the landscape of educational research on bullying and cyberbullying, by performing analyses on a set of Web of Science Core Collection-indexed documents published between 1991-2020. The main findings of the study provide data regarding (1) the evolution of publication trends over the past 30 years and the characteristics of the documents; (2) the most productive countries and institutions; (3) influential journals, authors, and articles in the area; (4) the collaboration patterns and the conceptual structure of educational research on bullying and cyberbullying. Based on the comprehensive overview of the educational research on the topic, suggestions for future work are provided#FRE#
