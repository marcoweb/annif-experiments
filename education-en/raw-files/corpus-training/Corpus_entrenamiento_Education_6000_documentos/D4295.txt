#ITI#An individualised approach towards student retention: students at the centre of university deferral and leave-taking policy#FTI#
#IRE#As the university student body becomes more diversified and students’ lives less linear, student retention carries increased importance for universities, including the conversion of deferrers and the re-enrolment of leave-taking students. This paper is based on a broader research project which explored national patterns of deferral and leave of absence in Australia and the policies and strategies for re-engaging the students who defer or take leave. Through a mixed research design, the study explores the extent to which students are positioned at the centre of deferral and leave of absence policy, informed by relationship marketing concepts. This study suggests that many universities have moved towards greater consideration of student perspectives and individualised approaches to building a trustworthy and supportive relationship with deferral and leave-taking students, based on data analytics of individual students’ information and circumstances. Despite such efforts, there remain both limitations and tensions within these approaches. © The Australian Association for Research in Education, Inc. 2022.
