#ITI#Protecting the University, Policing Race: A Case Study of Campus Policing#FTI#
#IRE#This exploratory instrumental case study provides a nuanced look at campus policing and its relationship to the well-documented perpetuation of racial inequality in U.S. higher education. To accomplish this broad goal, the study examines the experiences and perceptions of campus policing with one group, Black undergraduatemen. Combining the theoretical perspectives of racial formation theory and boundaries, the major themes describe (a) how race is embedded into campus police practices, namely campus crime alerts and identification checks and (b) social practices utilized by Black undergraduates to evade campus police harm. The analysis supports the perspective that campus policing represents a racial project due to how race is a marker for granting or limiting access to the university and the benefits of campus police protection#FRE#
