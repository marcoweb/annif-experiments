#ITI#Delphi investigation of strategies to develop cultural competence in physical education teacher education#FTI#
#IRE# Background: The shifting demographics of the United States population remains a central challenge for the education sector. A pressing concern rests with the continued cultural gap that exists between a largely homogenous teacher labor force and an increasingly heterogeneous student population. Provided the longstanding existence of a cultural gap, there have been calls for scholars to identify strategies that could help current and future teachers bridge this gap in their classrooms. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to generate consensus regarding the strategies physical education teacher education (PETE) programs can adopt to develop cultural competence among physical education teacher candidates. Method: The study employed a three-round Delphi process involving the repeated circulation of a survey to panel members (N = 12) with a record of pedagogic and/or scholarly engagement with cultural competence. In Round-I, participants were provided an open-ended question that prompted them to list up to ten strategies a PETE program could use to promote cultural competence in teacher candidates. During Round-II, participants were then asked to rate the list of strategies regarding the impact and contextual feasibility within a PETE program. In Round-III, participants again rated the same list of strategies with the considerations of other panelists’ ratings. Results: The Delphi panel created an initial list of 37 strategies that could be used to develop cultural competence in teacher candidates. Round-II and Round-III data were analyzed using descriptive statistics to calculate group means. Expert consensus determined eight cultural competence strategies as the most impactful and feasible for PETE programs. The eight strategies illustrated how cultural knowledge, critical awareness, skill development, and environmental supports all need to be addressed. Faculty buy-in and departmental leadership were also identified as critical to executing those strategies. Discussion/Conclusion: The list of strategies is not intended to be exhaustive; however, it does provide a guide for PETE faculty to start the process of promoting cultural competence. In light of the growing societal emphasis on issues pertinent to the cultural gap in teaching, the authors encourage further investigation of the actual impact and feasibility of these strategies#FRE#
