#ITI#Low-Income Students Thriving in Postsecondary Educational Environments#FTI#
#IRE#All students should have the ability to thrive within collegiate environments. Despite widening access for postsecondary education participation, low-income students often do not experience the collegiate environment in the same ways as their well-resourced peers. Previous research highlights obstacles low-income students face; yet, these results frame low-income students from a deficit perspective as though they lack in specific ways and contribute to further marginalizing this underserved student population. More research must focus on what contributes, enables, or facilitates academic, personal, and social success for low-income students during their enrollment. Understanding individual and organizational features promoting thriving for low-income students can help institutional leaders cultivate campus environments that respond to student’s intellectual, personal, and social development. This study contributes to reframing the conversation about low-income students through an exploration of how lowincome students thrived in collegiate environments. Framed using Schreiner’s concept of thriving, this study illuminated how 30 low-income students successfully navigated college expectations. Findings illustrate thriving occurred in three ways: asking for help, taking advantage of opportunities, and integrating financial implications and knowledge. The article concludes with a discussion and implications for student affairs practice, theory, and future research#FRE#
