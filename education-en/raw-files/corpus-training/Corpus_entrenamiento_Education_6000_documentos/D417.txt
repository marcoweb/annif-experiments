#ITI#Bringing DisCrit theory to practice in the development of an action for equity collaborative network: passion projects#FTI#
#IRE# Disability Critical Race Theory (Dis/Crit) was useful as a tool and a lens for the development of a collaborative network of educators, community providers, and community stakeholders including educators, community members, parents, and individuals. Initially I engaged these stakeholders in action research sessions to inform planning for developing contextualized cultural competence among pre-service special education teachers. Examining equity and inequity in educational and community experiences for people representing minoritized identities including disability, race, ethnicity, language, immigrant status, gender, sexual orientation and socioeconomic status broadened our focus and passion for change. Expanding the process of building collective narrative inquiry, our network built projects to disrupt inequities at the intersections of disability and race in schools and community spaces. I discuss the utility of finding common ground in the theoretical framing lens Dis/Crit provides for planning action and collaboration among stakeholders. Finally, I share projects developed through our process to illustrate the influence of specific tenets of DisCrit theory in practical collaborative action#FRE#
