#ITI#Student evaluation of teaching: gender bias in a country at the forefront of gender equality#FTI#
#IRE# Research on gender equality in Higher Education indicates that female academics might not have the same opportunities for promotion as male academics. One of the are as in Higher Education where gender bias has been reported is in Student Evaluations of Teaching (SET). The aim of this article is to analyse possible gendered characteristics of communication between students and teachers in higher education, as reflected in SET. The article builds on mixed-method research. Five years of SET responses were analysed quantitatively and one year of open answers was analysed qualitatively. The qualitative data was then coded quantitatively. Iceland offers an excellent case for this study as it has been a forerunner in gender equality for years. The quantitative analysis shows that male students rate female teachers lower than their male counterparts, and the qualitative analyses indicate that the evaluation pattern of male and female teachers differs. Additionally, differences were found in the comments received by the teachers. Comments on male teachers referred to subject knowledge, while female teachers received comments on their service to students and relatability. There thus seems to be a gender bias in SET in Iceland despite its reputation for gender equality#FRE#
