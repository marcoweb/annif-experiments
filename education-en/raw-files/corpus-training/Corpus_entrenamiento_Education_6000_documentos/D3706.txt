#ITI#Student expectations of teaching and learning when starting university: a systematic review#FTI#
#IRE#Student expectations are complex constructs that can influence adaptability, engagement, achievement, satisfaction and retention. A number of individual studies have been published on the expectations of students when starting university, however none that synthesise student expectations of teaching and learning. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to understand student expectations of teaching and learning when starting university. A systematic search strategy identified 2950 studies, of which nine met all eligibility criteria. Relevant data was extracted and a narrative synthesis conducted, revealing four key themes: additional study, self-managing learning, teaching and learning activities, and accessibility. Students expect to complete additional study and take responsibility for their own learning, but may be unsure how to manage this. They expect to have to attend all sessions and commonly expect lectures, but thoughts on other methods of teaching and learning vary. Students also have high expectations of teaching staff, particularly with regards to access and resources. This knowledge is important in enabling teaching staff to better align preconceived ideas of university teaching and learning with reality, support a positive university experience, and improve satisfaction and retention. Future research should further investigate student expectations of teaching and learning independently, perhaps from a qualitative perspective, as well as exploring interventions to help manage these expectations when necessary#FRE#
