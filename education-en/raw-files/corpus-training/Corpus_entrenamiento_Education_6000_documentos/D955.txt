#ITI#Digital Tools in Informal Science Education Sites: A Systematic Literature Review#FTI#
#IRE# Informal science activities occurring at various non-traditional learning sites present a pivotal model for involving youths in the science learning process. The dynamic landscape of emerging technologies has prompted the exploration of innovative methodologies to bolster and refine informal science education. However, the expanse of this field and its attendant complexities has led to a lack of empirical evidence on the subject matter necessitating further research. This paper presents the findings of a systematic literature review, spanning the years 2017 to 2022, focusing on empirical inquiries into the deployment and impact of digital tools and technologies on the cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions of student learning. The investigation pertains specifically to unconstrained, extracurricular learning environments, encompassing science centers and museums and outdoor locations. A methodical search of renowned electronic databases, including ACM Digital Library, ERIC, Google Scholar, Sage, and Web of Science, supplemented by rigorous cross-referencing, yielded a corpus of seventeen (n = 17) relevant studies. These were subjected to a thorough qualitative content analysis. A diverse array of scientific concepts was found to have been investigated using hardware-based, software-based, or mixed approaches. Notably, augmented reality (AR) emerges as a preeminent focal point within the purview of digital interfaces explored by researchers. The synthesis of findings underscores the affirmative influence of digital tools and technologies on pivotal facets such as engagement, motivation, attitude towards science, and comprehension of scientific principles. In culmination, this study delineates prospective research focus for future studies in informal science education.#FRE#
