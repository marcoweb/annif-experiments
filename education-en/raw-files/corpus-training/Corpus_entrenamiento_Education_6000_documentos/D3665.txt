#ITI#A mixed method exploration of student perceptions of assessment in nursing and biomedicine#FTI#
#IRE#Assessment in higher education requires a high level of accountability and responsibility and is a major influence on student learning but can be a source of stress for staff and students. This project aimed to evaluate first-year students’ conceptions of assessment in biomedical science and nursing to determine positive or negative trends and how these can be facilitated or mitigated. This mixed-methods study compared the conceptions of assessment between students in nursing and biomedical science students at one university, using the Conceptions of Assessment questionnaire. The results revealed that overall students in the two different areas of study had similar perceptions of assessment. Students were found to have positive conceptions of assessment which were identified as relating to their secondary education. Thematic analysis of students’ responses identified eight themes associated with their perception of what assessment is, and the associated limitations of assessment and the multi-faceted personal factors that affected students’ position towards assessment. This study recommends a shift in focus from assessment relating to accountability, towards assessment for learning to maintain students’ initial perceptions of assessment to ensure their experience aligns with their expectations. Transparent communication about assessment requirements and support for students to undertake assessment may mitigate students’ negative perceptions held towards assessment#FRE#
