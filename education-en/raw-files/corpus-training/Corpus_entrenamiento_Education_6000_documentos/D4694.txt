#ITI#An examination of student user experience (UX) and perceptions of remote invigilation during online assessment#FTI#
#IRE#This study aimed to understand the effects of a custom-developed, artificial intelligence–based, asynchronous remote invigilation system on the student user experience. The study was conducted over 3 years at a large Australian university, and findings demonstrate that familiarity with the system over time improved student attitudes towards remote invigilation. Positive experiences were found to be related to ease of use and convenience for test sitting. The majority of students reported that it was important for the institution to have approaches such as remote invigilation to discourage cheating and they believed that the system was useful in this regard. Perceived technical problems were found to invoke feelings of anxiety with being remotely invigilated, and students suggested that greater clarity on expectations of appropriate behaviour, privacy and data security would help alleviate discomfort and improve the system. Implications for practise or policy: • Educators can improve the student user experience of remote invigilation by ensuring that students are provided the opportunity to practise and become familiar with using remote invigilation software before any summative assessment task. • Administrators should provide clear policy guidance about the management of student data collected during remotely invigilated assessment tasks © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
