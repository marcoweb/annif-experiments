#ITI#Can SENCOs do their job in a bubble? The impact of Covid-19 on the ways in which we conceptualise provision for learners with special educational needs#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this article is to critique the practices of those coordinating provision for children and young people with special educational needs during the Coronavirus pandemic. Whilst many schools are focusing on the practical aspects of getting students and staff back to school, there is a danger that practicalities may obfuscate broader systemic problems. In terms of educating children and young people with special educational needs and/or disabilities, Covid-19 offers an opportunity to reflect on the difference between physical ‘bubbles’ designed to reduce transmission and the theoretical and professional ‘bubbles’ that have existed for many years. Whilst the former is urgent, it cannot be allowed to overwhelm the important; the role of the SENCO being one example. As education systems vary across geo-political contexts, a critique of practice in England is used as an exemplar for analysis#FRE#
