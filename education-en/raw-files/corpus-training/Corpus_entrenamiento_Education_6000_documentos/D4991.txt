#ITI#Articulating Diversity on Campus: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Diversity Statements at Historically White Institutions#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) was to examine how diversity is articulated via institutional diversity statements. Drawing on statements from 92 historically white institutions, the study examined both what institutions convey as significant via diversity statements and the subsequent consequences of such language. Guided by Thomas’s (2018, 2020) diversity regimes as a theoretical framework and Van Dijk’s (1993) sociocognitive approach to CDA, we consider the ways in which institutions of higher education exert control in defining the meanings associated with diversity in university life. Results highlight four discourses that functioned across the 92 statements#FRE#
