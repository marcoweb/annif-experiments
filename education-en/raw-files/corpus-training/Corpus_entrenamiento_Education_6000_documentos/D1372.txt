#ITI#Co-creating curriculum with students, teachers, and practitioners in a technology-enhanced environment#FTI#
#IRE# The paper introduces an approach that facilitates whole-class curriculum co-creation and presents a case study conducted in a higher education institution in Hong Kong where it was implemented. The approach enables students to actively contribute to constructing a curriculum in partnership with teachers and practitioners, using scenario development techniques within the technology-enhanced learning environments. In this sense, the study is compatible with and contributes to contemporary higher education requirements for future-ready students, able to work in fast-changing, digitalized and globalized working environments. The case study describes the implementation of the approach in undergraduate and postgraduate knowledge management courses. The mix-method design was employed, including content analysis of scenarios, a questionnaire asking for students’ feedback, and teacher’s observations. The findings revealed that the approach enabled students and the teacher to work more collaboratively and co-create some aspects of the knowledge management courses (e.g., identifying and compiling relevant subject trends), even if some challenges were experienced. The paper points to the need for students’ ownership when it comes to developing curricula that better consider students’ experiences and meaning-making processes. The paper contributes to contemporary higher education discourse by providing conceptual and practical guidance on how to enact whole-class curriculum co-creation for teachers interested in such practice. © Association for Educational Communications and Technology 2023.#FRE#
