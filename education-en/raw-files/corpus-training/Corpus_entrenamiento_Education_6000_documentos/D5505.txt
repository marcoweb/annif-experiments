#ITI#Learning environments associated with technology-based science classrooms for gifted Singaporean females#FTI#
#IRE#Because there has been very little past research into gifted students’ science learning environments, especially in Singapore, we selected from four established questionnaires six learning environment scales that are consistent with Van Tassel-Baska and Stambaugh’s guidelines for gifted education. These scales were modified slightly to enhance suitability for the target population and refined further based on feedback from teachers and students in a pilot study. Data from administration of the questionnaires to 722 gifted science students in grades 9 and 10 were analysed to provide support for the questionnaire’s factorial validity, internal consistency reliability, ability to differentiate between classrooms, and predictive validity (in terms of associations with self-efficacy). To evaluate a new one-student one-laptop program being implemented for the first time, we compared the learning environments of this program with regular classrooms and found higher levels of perceived investigation, task orientation, collaboration, computer usage and formative assessment in technology-based classrooms#FRE#
