#ITI#Uncovering environmental and sustainability education themes in Caribbean secondary education certificate (CSEC) English literature#FTI#
#IRE#An examination of school curriculum documents which guide teaching in Caribbean schools indicate that while some efforts have been made to infuse ESE into some subjects, very little progress has been made in incorporating it into the teaching of English. One pedagogical technique to address this situation is ecocriticism. The authors conducted ecocritical analyses of two selections of West Indian prose: For the Life of Laetitia (Hodge 1993) and Breath, Eyes, Memory (Danticat 1994), from the current CSEC English Literature syllabus to unearth the ESE themes in these works and the implications of such analyses for the teaching of ESE. In addition to the conclusion that both prose selections contain ample opportunities for the teaching of ESE within the specific subject, the study indicates that within anglophone Caribbean literature a palpable richness exists that can deepen environmental and sustainability education more broadly. Pedagogical and curricular implications along with practical advice for doing ecocritical readings are discussed#FRE#
