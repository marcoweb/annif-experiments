#ITI#Envisioning indigenized geography: a two-eyed seeing approach#FTI#
#IRE#Addressing educational curricula and programs in post-secondary education for Reconciliation brings new opportunities and challenges for geography educators, including decolonizing and indigenizing their own teaching practices and perspectives. A team of geography educators, from vastly different geographies and contexts, explored their understandings and approaches to indigenization and found commonalities aligned with Two-Eyed Seeing, a framework that calls for a weaving of perspectives to hold views of both Indigenous and Western knowledge simultaneously. While originally applied in a teaching context, Two-Eyed Seeing is now recognized as a valuable approach in Indigenous research but remains promising as a means to connect indigenous knowledge and epistemology to geography teaching practice. A review of challenges in indigenization efforts in education indicates that Two-Eyed Seeing can address a number of pedagogical challenges, including reducing binary perspectives, providing a more holistic worldview, and creating a safe space for students. Realizing goals of reconciliation, decolonization, and indigenization requires contributions and efforts from across the geography education community, including from non-Indigenous actors who may not be active in the Indigenous Geographies space. Providing strategies and examples of approaches such as Two-Eyed Seeing is critical to support these educators and ensure the best learning opportunities for their students#FRE#
