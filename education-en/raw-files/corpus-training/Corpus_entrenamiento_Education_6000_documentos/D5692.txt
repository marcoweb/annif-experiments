#ITI#In relation to the relationship: teachers of pupils with multiple disabilities and parents following the COVID-19 pandemic#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this research is to study the relationship between parents of pupils with multiple disabilities and their teachers. This, in order to understand the needs for special education teacher training programmes as these are perceived by the teachers who experienced an abrupt transition to distance learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The research combines both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The data was collected through an online questionnaire which included open and closed questions. The closed questions were analysed through frequency mapping and percentages and the open questions were analysed through content analysis method. The participants of the research were 48 teachers from schools for pupils with multiple disabilities who were teaching via distance learning during the 2019–2020 school year at the time of the first lockdown. Thematic analysis resulted in the identification of three main themes: (1) Factors challenging the cooperation between parents and the teachers; (2) supportive needs of parents; (3) Recommendations for training of teachers. There is no doubt that the teachers’ toolbox must encompass two central aspects: First is the inclusion of hands-on digital experience in the teachers’ training. The second includes the incorporation of skills focusing involving parents when teaching via distance learning; that is, training parents how to use the assistive technology during distance learning#FRE#
