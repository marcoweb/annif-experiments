#ITI#A Latent Class Analysis of Racial Terminology in Education Research: Patterns of Racial Classifications in AERA Journals#FTI#
#IRE# Education research commonly uses racial terminology but with little understanding of racial classification patterns across the field. In this study, we surface the use of racial terminology using a census of original research published in American Educational Research Association journals between 2009 and 2019. We do so as an ethical quantification exercise, seeking to further social justice goals by encouraging scholarship on racial terminology in education research. Using latent class analysis, we identify six classes of research ranging from about a third of articles that use almost no racial terminology to an eighth of articles that use terminology extensively. More recently published articles are more likely to be part of classes with extensive or narrow racial terminology usage and less likely to be in classes that are absent racial terminology. Qualitative research is more likely to use extensive racial terminology, and quantitative research is more likely to be absent of or narrowly use racial terminology. We conclude with recommendations for how future research can build off of these findings to address questions on how to authentically and purposefully use racial terminology in ways that reflect the complex ways people identify themselves to better situate education research to address racial inequality#FRE#
