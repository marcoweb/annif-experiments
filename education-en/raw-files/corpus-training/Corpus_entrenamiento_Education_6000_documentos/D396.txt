#ITI#Latinx faculty representation and resource allocation at Hispanic Serving Institutions#FTI#
#IRE# Early advocates for Hispanic-Serving Institutions argued that HSIs should require ‘significant Hispanic staffing patterns at the faculty … level’ and ‘serious commitment to the needs of Hispanic learners.’ We examine whether HSIs, nearly 40 years later, have addressed these calls by detailing rates of Latinx faculty representation and exploring how HSIs incorporate faculty in federally funded HSI initiatives. Analyses of all Title V funded HSIs from 2009–2016 (N = 167) indicate that the average Latinx student-to-Latinx faculty ratio is 146:1, whereas the corollary White student-to-White faculty ratio is 10:1. Moreover, analyses of HSI grant abstracts indicate that HSIs expend federal funding–which was initially intended to ameliorate educational inequalities – on training White faculty to become more ‘culturally aware' and ‘culturally engaged.’ We argue these findings align with two core tenets of Critical Race Theory (CRT) – namely CRT’s critique of racial liberalism, and Derrick Bell’s conceptualization of interest convergence#FRE#
