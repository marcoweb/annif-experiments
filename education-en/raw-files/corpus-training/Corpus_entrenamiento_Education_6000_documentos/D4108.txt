#ITI#Big ideas in the geography curriculum: nature, awareness and need#FTI#
#IRE#Big ideas, sometimes referred to as key, core, fundamental or threshold concepts, are widely applicable concepts at the heart of disciplines that are or have been central and influential for their fields. Attention here is particularly directed to meta-concepts common to sister disciplines in the sciences. “Learning thresholds”, “powerful knowledge” and their meanings are singled out for discussion having become widely relevant to geography. Other empowering big ideas for geography are identified; collectively these can be close to the global concerns that new learners may have, giving them motivation for their learning. Developing global challenges, from coronavirus infections to climate change, are geographically varied in their reach and impacts. Student engagement can be enhanced as concepts are addressed and they embark on the methodological and factual knowledge and skills that give new value to HE learning. Fresh concepts can also be realized from students’ individual projects or enquiries. In these ways big ideas can provide motivational stimuli for progressing enterprising research through such learning#FRE#
