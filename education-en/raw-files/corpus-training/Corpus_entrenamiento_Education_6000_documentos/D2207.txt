#ITI#Building a high school violence prevention app to educate and protect students#FTI#
#IRE# The hostile learning environment and academic disruptions that result from high school violence underscore the need for prevention education. Technology can facilitate the dissemination of educational content, prevention tools, and resources to students. We describe the three-phase iterative process that engaged high school students, administrators and staff, and parents to develop and refine the school safety mobile application (app), uSafeHSTM. During the three-phase development process focus groups and surveys were administered with students, school administrators and staff, and guardians at 13 high schools. Pilot data was collected from seven New England public and private high schools. Optimizing mobile app technology is a promising method of reaching high school students and delivering student support resources that are customizable by each school and safety tools not currently available for this population#FRE#
