#ITI#A systematic review of school-based positive psychology interventions to foster teacher wellbeing#FTI#
#IRE#Previous research into approaches to support the wellbeing of teachers have been informative in understanding the sources of stress and burnout, and, strategies to help teachers cope with the demands of the profession. However, less research has focused on approaches that promote wellbeing in a proactive and preventative way, a notion captured by the field of positive psychology. This study aimed to explore how school-based positive psychology interventions are delivered to foster teacher wellbeing, drawing on evidence from ten studies in a qualitative systematic review. The results indicated that interventions included mindfulness-based, multi-modal programs, and, gratitude interventions. All reported outcomes were positive, with some findings indicating that the structure of the interventions was as important to success as the content of the programs. Six common core elements were identified, including voluntary participation, the use of multiple methods, context-specific design, group format, professional instructors, and, weekly sessions. Based on the exisiting literature and an emphasis on common unifying findings, this review highlights the potential of positive psychology interventions in supporting teacher wellbeing by providing practical insights for schools, teacher educators, and, policymakers#FRE#
