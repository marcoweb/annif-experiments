#ITI#Influencing factors of social entrepreneurship intentions in a higher education context#FTI#
#IRE#The teaching of entrepreneurship has been progressively included in the curricula of several university courses to stimulate the development of empowering attitudes and an entrepreneurial mentality. However, a new form of entrepreneurship has emerged with a focus on sustainability and the creation of new projects that aim to reduce social asymmetries and contribute to a fairer and more balanced society. The role of universities is also to foster the emergence of these projects through the implementation of practices aimed at fostering social entrepreneurship among students. This study aims to understand the determinant dimensions that characterise the students’ social entrepreneurial intention. For this purpose, a sample of 177 students attending a social entrepreneurship course in a higher education institution was employed. The findings indicate that individual, organisation, and context constructs are determinants of students’ entrepreneurial intention. However, not all organisational factors contribute equally. Mentoring and social networks are relevant elements for the entrepreneurial intention of individuals, while curriculum and critical pedagogy are not recognised as determinants#FRE#
