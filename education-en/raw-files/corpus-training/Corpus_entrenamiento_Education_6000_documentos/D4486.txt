#ITI#The micro-politics of the enactment of a school literacy policy#FTI#
#IRE#This article reports on a case study investigating the micro-politics of policy enactment in a school in England. The case is sited in the literacy policy of a primary school in challenging circumstances as it joins a Multi-Academy Trust (MAT). Data gathering consisted of interviews with the school headteacher, assistant headteacher, and literacy coordinator. Data were analysed thematically using the thinking tools of Bourdieu to understand and explain the micro-politics of the policy enactment. Findings suggest that the enactment of policy in schools in England can be a dynamic undertaking when there is judged a need to improve. The micro-politics of the school may become dominated by the need to comply with MATs and private providers of educational solutions, potentially reducing the autonomy of teachers and headteachers#FRE#
