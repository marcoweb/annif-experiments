#ITI#Educational Language Policy in Massachusetts: Discourses of the LOOK Act#FTI#
#IRE# Within the United States, equity for English learners, while essential, has remained elusive. As such, language policy in education is a central issue. When An Act Relative to Language Opportunity for Our Kids (LOOK Act) was passed in 2017 in Massachusetts, it was celebrated as a victory for bilingual education after a 15-year period of mandated English-only education. This study thus aims to analyze the language and intertextual discourses of the LOOK Act to inform its interpretation and appropriation by agents at various levels and investigate how language, language use, and language users are positioned in the Act.#FRE#
