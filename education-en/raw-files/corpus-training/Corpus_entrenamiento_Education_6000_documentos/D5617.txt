#ITI#Do peers influence autistic behaviours? First insights from observations made by teachers#FTI#
#IRE#Evidence suggests the social development of typically developing children and adolescents is significantly influenced by their peers. In contrast, little is known about peer influence on the autistic behaviours of children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In structured interviews, 22 teachers from a special needs school for students with ASD provided information on observed peer influence frequency in 23 children and adolescents (age M = 9.96 years; SD = 3.50; 2 girls). Across 12 autistic behaviours, teachers estimated that in a typical school week on M = 0.75 days (SD = 0.59) they observe students with ASD changing their autistic behaviour in response to their peers. Observed peer influence varied across behavioural domains and there was a tendency for increased severity of autistic condition to be associated with less peer influence susceptibility. Findings are discussed in relation to perspectives for supporting students with ASD and future research#FRE#
