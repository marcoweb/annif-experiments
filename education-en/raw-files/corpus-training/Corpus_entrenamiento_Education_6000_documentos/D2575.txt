#ITI#An exploration of instructors' and students' perspectives on remote delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic#FTI#
#IRE# The world-wide pivot to remote learning due to the exogenous shocks of COVID-19 across educational institutions has presented unique challenges and opportunities. This study documents the lived experiences of instructors and students and recommends emerging pathways for teaching and learning strategies post-pandemic. Seventy-one instructors and 122 students completed online surveys containing closed and open-ended questions. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted, including frequencies, chi-square tests, Welch Two-Samples t-tests, and thematic analyses. The results demonstrated that with effective online tools, remote learning could replicate key components of content delivery, activities, assessments, and virtual proctored exams. However, instructors and students did not want in-person learning to disappear and recommended flexibility by combining learning opportunities in in-person, online, and asynchronous course deliveries according to personal preferences. The paper concludes with future directions and how the findings influenced our planning for Fall 2021 delivery.

Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) allowed institutions across the world to continue teaching and learning at all levels of education during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this form of delivery, created under conditions of uncertainty, was developed out of an urgency to keep education going rather than maintaining it at the same level. What this paper adds This study comes after ERT, and is situated between ERT and the return to campus, with some social distancing restrictions still active, in a delivery method widely viewed as “remote delivery”. This is a case study of an entire Canadian higher education institution that implemented remote learning for over one full academic year, documenting and examining instructors' and students' experiences and challenges of the remote learning course delivery format. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected to provide a holistic overview of instructors' and students' experiences of delivery method and assessments including the use of face-tracking proctoring software. Implications for practice and/or policy Compared to ERT, remote delivery was a thoughtful and deliberate way to transform in-person courses into virtual learning experiences. Instructors and students were able to successfully replicate many features of in-person learning and assessments experiences in remote delivery of courses by using effective online tools to teach and learn. As a result, instructors and students called for the use of elements of remote delivery to create more flexible learning opportunities by combining in-person, live streaming, and asynchronous learning options#FRE#
