#ITI#Our college degree: familial engagement in the lives of diverse Black collegians#FTI#
#IRE# The purpose of this study was to examine the role of family in the educational success of diverse Black college students. We offer a more nuanced examination of how Black families influence academic achievement and college going by disaggregating Black college student data by nativity and immigrant generation. Our findings demonstrate how Black families’ focus on race and nationality pride as well as the use of familial motivation to prepare Black students for college. Black students draw from their familial context to develop a Black community while in college and become role models within their families in the later college experience. Within each of these themes, we discuss the similarities and differences across nativity and immigrant generation in Black students’ experiences#FRE#
