#ITI#The Sociohistorical Evolution of the Language of Culturally-Based Pedagogy and its Impact on Teacher Education#FTI#
#IRE# The purpose of this literature review was to examine how language is used to describe and advance culturally-based pedagogy to critically reflect on the language employed in teacher education research. Our intent was to understand the terminology that has moved conversations of equity, diversity, and cultural ways of knowing to the center of urban education research and practice. Findings indicate the discourse of culturally-based pedagogy relies upon: (1) the exploration of the construct of culture, (2) the knowledge of the socio-historical context of specific terminology, and (3) a perspective that discourse is generative and dynamic.#FRE#
