#ITI#Socially Prescribed Perfectionism and Depression: Roles of Academic Pressure and Hope#FTI#
#IRE#Studies have shown that socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP) is a critical predictor of depression. However, few studies have explored the mechanisms underlying the effects of SPP on depression in Chinese adolescents. Accordingly, the current study aims to explore the relationship between SPP and depression among Chinese adolescents, including the mediating roles of academic pressure, and the moderating role of hope. A total of 3,510 Chinese adolescents in high school (15.56 ± 1.14 years old) participated in the current research by responding to questionnaires on completing measures of SPP, academic pressure, hope and depression. After controlling for gender and age, the results showed that SPP significantly and positively predicted depression, and that academic pressure mediated the link between SPP and depression. In addition, the mediating effect was moderated by hope. Compared with those with high levels of hope, academic pressure had a weaker positive predictive effect on depression than in those with low levels of hope. These findings deepen the explanation of depression formation mechanisms from a personality perspective and have important theoretical and practical implications for the prevention and intervention of adolescent depression. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.#FRE#
