#ITI#Stat-Knowlab. Assessment and Learning of Statistics with Competence-based Knowledge Space Theory#FTI#
#IRE# An intelligent tutoring system for learning basic statistics, called Stat-Knowlab, is presented and analyzed. The algorithms implemented in the system are based on the competence-based knowledge space theory, a mathematical theory developed for the formative assessment of knowledge and learning. The system’s architecture consists of the two assessment and learning modules that interact with each other in a continuous exchange of information about the current knowledge state of a student. This allows the system to personalize the student’s learning, providing only with the learning objects that she is ready to learn. During the browsing of the system, several types of navigation data are recorded. In this work, we analyzed data from two studies that were aimed at examining the learning processes induced by the navigation of the system. The results of both studies highlighted that the system is useful for monitoring the student learning processes during a university course of basic statistics#FRE#
