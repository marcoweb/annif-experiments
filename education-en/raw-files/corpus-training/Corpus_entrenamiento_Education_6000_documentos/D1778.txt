#ITI#Emotion regulation, e-learning readiness, technology usage status, in-class smartphone cyberloafing, and smartphone addiction in the time of COVID-19 pandemic#FTI#
#IRE# Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread quickly, e-learning became compulsory and disseminated throughout the world. During the pandemic, smartphones are frequently used to access e-learning content, but connecting to technological tools increased the risk of cyberloafing during e-courses. Currently, there are a limited number of studies on how e-learning will evolve under compulsory conditions. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between emotion regulation, e-learning readiness, technology usage status (TUS), in-class smartphone cyberloafing, and smartphone addiction (SA) of the students during the pandemic. Methods: In total 1294 students participated in this study. A research model was tested by structural equation modelling. Results and Conclusion: The findings of this study indicated that there is a relationship between TUS and SA. Emotion regulation was related to SA. E-learning readiness levels can help to explain cyberloafing. This study presents a conceptual model of the variables that affect cyberloafing in the context of the e-learning environment#FRE#
