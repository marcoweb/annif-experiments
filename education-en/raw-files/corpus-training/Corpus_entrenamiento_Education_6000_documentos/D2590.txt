#ITI#Pedagogical features of interactive apps for effective learning of foundational skills#FTI#
#IRE# Interactive apps are commonly used to support the acquisition of foundational skills. Yet little is known about how pedagogical features of such apps affect learning outcomes, attainment and motivation—particularly when deployed in lower-income contexts, where educational gains are most needed. In this study, we analyse which app features are most effective in supporting the acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy skills. We compare five apps developed for the Global Learning XPRIZE and deployed to 2041 out-of-school children in 172 remote Tanzanian villages. A total of 41 non-expert participants each provided 165 comparative judgements of the five apps from the competition, across 15 pedagogical features. Analysis and modelling of these 6765 comparisons indicate that the apps created by the joint winners of the XPRIZE, who produced the greatest learning outcomes over the 15-month field trial, shared six pedagogical features—autonomous learning, motor skills, task structure, engagement, language demand and personalisation. Results demonstrate that this combination of features is effective at supporting learning of foundational skills and has a positive impact on educational outcomes. To maximise learning potential in environments with both limited resources and deployment opportunities, developers should focus attention on this combination of features, especially for out-of-school children in low- and middle-income countries. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicInteractive apps are becoming common to support foundational learning for children both in and out of school settings.The Global Learning XPRIZE competition demonstrates that learning apps can facilitate learning improvements in out-of-school children living in sub-Saharan Africa.To understand which app features are most important in supporting learning in these contexts, we need to establish which pedagogical features were shared by the winning apps.What this paper addsEffective learning of foundational skills can be achieved with a range of pedagogical features.To maximise learning, apps should focus on combining elements of autonomous learning, motor skills, task structure, engagement, language demand and personalisation.Free Play is not a key pedagogical feature to facilitate learning within this context.Implications for practice and/or policyWhen developing learning apps with primary-aged, out-of-school children in low-income contexts, app developers should try to incorporate the six key features associated with improving learning outcomes.Governments, school leaders and parents should use these findings to inform their decisions when choosing an appropriate learning app for children#FRE#
