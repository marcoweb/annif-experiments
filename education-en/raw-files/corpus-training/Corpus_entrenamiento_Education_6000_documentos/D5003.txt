#ITI#Lifetime Experiences of Economic Constraints and Marginalization Among Incoming College Students: A Latent Profile Analysis#FTI#
#IRE#The present study examined the degree to which a large group of incoming college students (N = 2,290) had experienced economic constraints and marginalization across their lifetimes, before starting college. Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to identify groups of students whose lifetime experiences differed based on economic constraints and marginalization experiences, and four distinct profiles emerged: (1) Privileged (low economic constraints and low marginalization; 52.8%), (2) Primarily Marginalized (high marginalization, 30.1%), (3) Primarily Constrained (high economic constraints; 7%), and (4) Marginalized and Constrained (high marginalization and high economic constraints; 10.3%). Compared to the Privileged group, students in the Marginalized and Constrained group were five times more likely to be first-generation students, 2.5 times more likely to intend to seek counseling in college, and two times more likely to identify as a Student of Color. They also experienced significantly greater current financial stress and lower life satisfaction. Implications for research and practice are discussed#FRE#
