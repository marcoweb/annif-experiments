#ITI#The Impact of Relationships on the Experiences of Racially Minoritized LGBTQ+ Faculty in Higher Education#FTI#
#IRE#Faculty who are minoritized—those who are both lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer plus (LGBTQ+) and racially minoritized—experience significant challenges in higher education. Less is known about those who are both LGBTQ+ and racially minoritized. This study examined the experiences of 11 racially minoritized LGBTQ+ faculty teaching in higher education graduate programs and particularly focused on the ways relationships (including mentoring relationships, colleague relationships, and power-over relationships) impacted their sense of themselves in their graduate school and early career journeys. Support from both mentors and colleagues were instrumental in their success; manifestations of power-over dynamics by colleagues were detrimental for faculty who are dually minoritized. Findings point to the importance of instituting equity-based mentoring and adoption of colleagueship practices which center the thriving of racially minoritized LGBTQ+ faculty members higher education#FRE#
