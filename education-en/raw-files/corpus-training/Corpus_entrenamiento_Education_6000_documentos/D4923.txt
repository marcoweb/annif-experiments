#ITI#Becoming a Racially Just Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI): Leveraging HSI Grants for Organizational Identity Change#FTI#
#IRE#Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) are colleges and universities enrolling 25% Hispanic and Latina/e/o/x students yet lack an organizational identity for serving them. Salient issues facing educators and leaders at HSIs include enacting an HSI identity and transforming their organizational commitment to racial equity and social justice. In this practice brief, we illustrate how HSIs can leverage their federal grants to create transformational change. Examples come from research and practice with a focus on disrupting the campus’s commitment to whiteness and coloniality, supplementing fiscal resources for professional development focused on antiracism, racial justice, and the HSI identity, and leveraging grassroots leadership that will lead to transformational change#FRE#
