#ITI#Operationalizing Funds of Knowledge: Examining a Reciprocal Research Relationship Between a White Faculty Member and a Latino Student#FTI#
#IRE#This instrumental case study explored the development of a reciprocal relationship between a White faculty member and a Latino student during a community-based research project. This case study was situated at a regional comprehensive university (RCU) with a Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) designation. Funds of nowledge (FoK) theory was used to examine the case study. The findings demonstrate the Latino student and White faculty member mutually benefitted from sharing their expertise with one another by addressing individual knowledge needs during the community-based research project. The Latino student shared his community-based expertise and FoK with the faculty member improving the project’s efficacy. The faculty member supported the student’s civic leadership development, acquisition of community-based research skills, and holistic well-being. Reciprocity between the participants was created through the faculty member’s recognition of the student’s FoK and the student’s willingness to support his community and activate these FoK during the research study. We also found the institutional context encouraged the faculty member to work reciprocally with the student as the RCU had a student-centered mission. The study demonstrates how reciprocity between a White faculty member and a Latino student can encourage student civic leadership developmen#FRE#
