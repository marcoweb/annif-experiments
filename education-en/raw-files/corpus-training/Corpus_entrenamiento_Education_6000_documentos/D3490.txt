#ITI#Virtual reality to foster empathy in disability workers: A feasibility study during COVID-19#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Empathy is a critical skill required by disability workers. Virtual reality may increase access to staff training to foster empathy. Method: A mixed methods feasibility study investigated a custom-built virtual reality program, IMercyVE, which aimed to immerse a disability worker in a first-person perspective of having intellectual disability. Data were collected through online surveys (n = 9) completed before and after use of IMercyVE, and by videoconference focus groups (n = 6). Results: Qualitative findings included that IMercyVE delivered a novel experience for participants and a distinctive mode of learning that assisted participants to deepen their levels of empathy. Descriptive analyses of the surveys indicated that participants' empathy increased after engaging with IMercyVE. Conclusions: IMercyVE has the potential to be offered as a remotely delivered and flexible staff training modality suitable for building empathy. Further research with a larger sample is warranted#FRE#
