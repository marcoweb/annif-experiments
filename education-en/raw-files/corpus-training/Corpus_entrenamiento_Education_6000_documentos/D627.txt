#ITI#Securing work placements: strategies among international engineering students#FTI#
#IRE# As part of their international higher education experience, international students in some degree programs are required to secure and complete work placements. This is challenging to many, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, there is limited research on how international students navigate challenges to secure placements in their host country, which informed the current study. Data was gathered through 39 semi-structured interviews with 13 international engineering students and eight interviews with eight WIL staff. The study contributes to the literature by formulating the Perceiving–Planning–Performing Model (3-P Model), untangling students’ cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral engagement in securing placements. The Model informs stakeholder strategies in nurturing international students’ agency to secure placements and post-graduation work in their host country and globally#FRE#
