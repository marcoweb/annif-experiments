#ITI#Can Special Olympics coaches accurately report on the motor competence of children with intellectual disabilities?#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Motor competence is the ability to perform goal directed human movements in a co-ordinated, accurate and error free manner. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of coaches' perceptions of children's motor competence with their actual motor competence. Method: This study examined the motor competence of children with intellectual disabilities (n = 100) and coaches' perceptions of children's motor competence (n = 10). Participants were assessed using TGMD-3. Coaches completed an adapted version of the pictorial scale of Perceived Movement Skill Competence. Results: The predictive power of coaches perceived motor competence versus children's actual motor competence was assessed. Conclusions: This research will provide insight for sports organisations to determine whether coaches can accurately report on the motor competence of children with intellectual disabilities#FRE#
