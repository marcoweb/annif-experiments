#ITI#Not all paths lead to success: learning strategies and achievement among undergraduate students#FTI#
#IRE#In modern society, academic success is closely associated with achievement. In order to help students realise their potential, it is essential to understand the factors that promote academic success. The research literature indicates several factors that are associated with academic success, including learning strategies, self-direction, and social involvement. Little attention has been paid to the differential effect that these factors may have on students with different personality traits and levels of ability. The present study examined the learning, self-management, and social learning strategies of 199 second-year undergraduate students, and the relationship between these strategies and their grades over a period of two and a half years. In addition, the personality characteristics and aptitude of the students were also assessed. The findings indicated a correlation of self-management strategies and those associated with the learning environment with grades, and highlighted the importance of social strategies in certain situations. The theoretical implications of the findings and their practical implications for guiding and assisting students are discussed#FRE#
