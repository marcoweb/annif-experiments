#ITI#DAST or VoSAL? Adaptation of the VoSAL to Turkish and a comparison between the instruments#FTI#
#IRE#The Draw-A Scientist Test (DAST) has been used for many years as a data collection tool in studies where the image of the scientist is attempted to be determined. In this test, in which the image of scientist is attempted to be revealed with drawings, the drawings are analyzed using a coding ruler or checklist. However, the DAST has been criticized in terms of some methodological issues and it has been emphasized that alternative instruments should be developed. In this context, the Views of Scientist, their Activities, and Locations (VoSAL), developed as an alternative to the DAST, are discussed in this study. First, a validity and reliability study was carried out with the adaptation of the VoSAL into Turkish. At this stage, data were collected from 625 pre-service teachers. The analysis results showed that the VoSAL had excellent goodness-of-fit indices. In the second stage of study, the scientist image of 46 pre-service teachers were evaluated comparatively using the DAST and VoSAL. The results showed that the data of the DAST and VoSAL confirmed each other. The results were then discussed in terms of the scientist image literature#FRE#
