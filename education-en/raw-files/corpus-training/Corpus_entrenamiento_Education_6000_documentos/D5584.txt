#ITI#Language learning environments and reading achievement among students in China: evidence from PISA 2018 data#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, we examined relationships between learning environment characteristics (disciplinary climate, teacher support, and teacher feedback) and student outcomes (enjoyment of reading, and reading achievement) among 12,058 students from China who took part in the 2018 Programme for International Student Assessment. The results of structural equation modeling analyses revealed that teacher feedback and enjoyment of reading each had a statistically significant association with reading achievement. Additionally, enjoyment of reading mediated the association between teacher feedback and reading achievement#FRE#
