#ITI#Accuracy and precision of fixed and random effects in meta-analyses of randomized control trials for continuous outcomes#FTI#
#IRE# Meta-analyses of treatment effects in randomized control trials are often faced with the problem of missing information required to calculate effect sizes and their sampling variances. Particularly, correlations between pre- and posttest scores are frequently not available. As an ad-hoc solution, researchers impute a constant value for the missing correlation. As an alternative, we propose adopting a multivariate meta-regression approach that models independent group effect sizes and accounts for the dependency structure using robust variance estimation or three-level modeling. A comprehensive simulation study mimicking realistic conditions of meta-analyses in clinical and educational psychology suggested that imputing a fixed correlation 0.8 or adopting a multivariate meta-regression with robust variance estimation work well for estimating the pooled effect but lead to slightly distorted between-study heterogeneity estimates. In contrast, three-level meta-regressions resulted in largely unbiased fixed effects but more inconsistent prediction intervals. Based on these results recommendations for meta-analytic practice and future meta-analytic developments are provided#FRE#
