#ITI#Between intentionality and reality to promote positive youth development in sport-based programs: a case study in Brazil#FTI#
#IRE# Background: In many countries, sport programs have been designed in order to enhance young people's lives through the Positive Youth Development (PYD) framework and the teaching of life skills. In Brazil, there is a growing presence of programs that seek to meet these goals. Therefore, we conducted a case study to understand how one specific program operates such concepts in its guidelines and practice. Purpose: This case study examined the alignment between the guidelines of a nationwide Brazilian sport program and program delivery according to the PYD framework proposed by Petitpas et al. (2005, ‘A Framework for Planning Youth Sport Programs that Foster Psychosocial Development.’ The Sport Psychologist 19(1): 63–80. doi:10.1123/tsp.19.1.63.). Method: This study adopted a qualitative approach and a case study design. Participants were six technical directors and five coaches who were involved in program delivery. Data were collected through gathering program’s documents and semi-structured interviews. Interviews were structured according to the PYD framework dimensions proposed by Petitpas et al. (2005, ‘A Framework for Planning Youth Sport Programs that Foster Psychosocial Development.’ The Sport Psychologist 19(1): 63–80. doi:10.1123/tsp.19.1.63.), namely: (a) context, (b) external assets, (c) internal assets, and (d) research and evaluation. A deductive-inductive thematic analysis was conducted. Findings: Although the program’s guidelines included a PYD-oriented focus, they did not seem to be aligned with stakeholders’ conceptions in structuring and delivering the program. Thus, coaches seem to rely on their individual mindsets and initiatives, favoring implicit and unsystematic coaching strategies where PYD and life skills were left up to chance. The results indicate the important role played by technical directors in providing on-the-ground support for coaches to apply strategies that meet the main goals of the program. This seems to be a challenge that needs to be considered in order to ensure that actual reality is better aligned with the intentionality of the program#FRE#
