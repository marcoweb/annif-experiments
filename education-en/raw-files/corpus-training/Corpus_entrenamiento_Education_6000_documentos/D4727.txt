#ITI#Remodelling the role of facilitating conditions for Google Classroom acceptance: A revision of UTAUT2#FTI#
#IRE#Online learning environments have become a contemporary component of global tertiary education due to their affordances. These environments are hinged on internet-based learning management systems and one such tool is Google Classroom. However, empirical studies have indicated that gaps exist in determining how Google Classroom influences students’ behavioural intention to use it for online learning. Accordingly, this study defines a model based on the unified theory of acceptance and technology 2 (UTAUT2) to examine the relationship between facilitating conditions and other variables towards intention formation for Google Classroom usage. Based on a mixed method using the explanatory sequential design, survey data from 163 students were initially analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling followed by a qualitative approach based on open-ended questions for thematic analysis. Results from the partial least squares structural equation modelling approach validated the hypothesised model confirming the significant predictive relationship of facilitating conditions with effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, habit and social influence but had an insignificant relationship with behavioural intention. Furthermore, hedonic motivation and habit were the main predictors of behavioural intention by masking the role of facilitating conditions. Subsequently, the qualitative outcome indicated that habit and perceived control of using Google applications influence hedonic motivation. Finally, recommendations were made to universities towards policy formation and practice of virtual learning using Google Classroom © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
