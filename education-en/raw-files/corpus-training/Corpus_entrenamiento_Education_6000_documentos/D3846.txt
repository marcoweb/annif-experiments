#ITI#Fostering Play Through Virtual Teaching: Challenges, Barriers, and Strategies#FTI#
#IRE#Early childhood teachers routinely facilitate play-based learning experiences in their physical classrooms; however, the pivot to virtual teaching platforms created a barrier for providing age appropriate, play-based learning opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are few studies exploring how to promote play in the virtual classroom or what types of activities and learning experiences promote play in synchronous and asynchronous settings. Therefore, this study explored the barriers and challenges to fostering play through virtual teaching and the types of play-based instruction teachers were effectively able to implement in their virtual classroom. This study used content analysis along with descriptive analysis of an online survey with open-ended prompts that early childhood teachers completed (n = 76). Findings revealed two major themes related to challenges and barriers in teachers’ efforts to foster play-based learning through virtual formats. Even though teachers noted significant challenges and barriers they identified multiple play-based activities they were able to facilitate effectively through virtual formats. These activities were categorized through the theoretical framework of Piaget’s stages of the development of play with the addition of guided play. Implications for how play can be fostered through virtual teaching in early childhood classrooms were discussed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022.#FRE#
