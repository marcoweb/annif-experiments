#ITI#Critical and participatory design in-between the tensions of daily schooling: working towards sustainable and reflective digital school development#FTI#
#IRE# Using Critical Design (CD) and Participatory Design (PD) as analytical and normative vantage points, this contribution reflects on how characteristics of both approaches can be useful for a reflective and inclusive engagement with educational technology in school development processes. Illustrating initial empirical findings from the research project Smart Schools, we analyse how characteristics of CD and PD are challenged or affirmed when unfolding in school practice. Our data show how three key logics substantially challenge ideas of CD and PD in digital school development processes, namely: (1) the idea of digital school development as a set of sequential processes; (2) an understanding of digital and analogue as opposing conditions; and (3) the conceptualisation of knowledge hierarchies between students, teachers, and external stakeholders. Simultaneously, we observe perspectives that affirm both approaches. Consequently, we argue that the notions of critique and participation must be rethought to apply CD and PD in everyday school development processes#FRE#
