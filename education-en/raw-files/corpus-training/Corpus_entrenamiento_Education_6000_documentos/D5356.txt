#ITI#Extending the dialogic space: developing interprofessional expertise through a student-created podcast#FTI#
#IRE#Teachers must relate to practitioners from a range of professions, which represent different, sometimes conflicting, perspectives on teaching and learning. Thus, student teachers must develop the expertise to understand, challenge and make constructive use of the perspectives of other professionals. From a socio-cultural perspective, this study investigates how a student-created podcast emerges as an arena and genre for interprofessional work in teacher education. Interaction analysis was used to examine student teachers’ engagement with perspectives provided by professionals from the ed-tech sector. The results demonstrate how the student-created podcast affords dialogic spaces for developing interprofessional expertise in teacher education#FRE#
