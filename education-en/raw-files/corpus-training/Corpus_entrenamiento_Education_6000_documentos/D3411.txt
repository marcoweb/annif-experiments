#ITI#Unmasking transnational Hindutva: activist knowledge practices from the Indian diaspora#FTI#
#IRE#Activist research that conducts social investigation and analysis can be the key first step in organising at the grassroots and movement building. This paper critically analyses two research reports titled ‘The Foreign Exchange of Hate’ (Sabrang/Coalition against Genocide 2002) and ‘In Bad Faith’ (Awaaz South Asia Watch 2004) produced by progressive activists situated in progressive mobilisations in the North American and British South Asian diasporas. This research was amongst the earliest to systematically investigate and expose the transnational networks and activities of Hindu nationalism. Drawing on the scholarship of Aziz Choudry, I discuss key influences, goals, impacts and costs of these activist research projects. The analysis offer situated insights into the relationship between activist research and movement-building in the context of collective resistance to Hindu nationalism in Eurocentric, liberal multicultural societies#FRE#
