#ITI#Exposing the Intersections in LGBQ+ Student of Color Belongingness: Disrupting Hegemonic Narratives Sustained in College Impact Work#FTI#
#IRE#Using Astin’s inputs– environments– outcomes model and intersectional quantitative inquiry as a conceptual framework, we sought to understand which subgroups within the LGBQ+ student of color (SOC) population indicated a higher sense of belonging. Furthermore, we were interested which collegiate environments and experiences contributed to belonging for different subgroups of LGBQ+ SOC. Employing multiple linear regression analyses, we analyzed data from 1,468 LGBQ+ SOC. Results showed belonging for LGBQ+ SOC was associated with many collegiate experiences, including supportive residential environment, cocurricular engagement, campus engagement, faculty interaction, living on campus, racial campus climate, and LGBQ+ campus climate. Models were then run to examine conditional effects of these environments and experiences. Findings revealed how institutional environments differentially related to certain subgroups of LGBQ+ SOC. Implications for research and student affairs practice are discusse#FRE#
