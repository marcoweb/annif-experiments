#ITI#Language transfer theory and its policy implications: exploring interdependence between Luganda, Runyankole-Rukiga, and English in Uganda#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of the current study is to expand our understanding of cross-linguistic transfer (CLT) to new languages and settings under-represented in the research literature. Empirical evidence of CLT is almost exclusively demonstrated in studies examining European and Asian languages in high-income countries. Literacy data were collected from 3561 second-grade students in one of two languages in Uganda–Luganda and Runyankole-Rukiga–and English. Structural equation modelling was used to test a latent construct of alphabetical knowledge and a path model of bilingual reading comprehension. Findings suggest that second-grade students transfer decoding and reading comprehension skills from their first to second language, and initial evidence that the interdependence varies according to the language used in the classroom. Implications for language-in-education policies are discussed#FRE#
