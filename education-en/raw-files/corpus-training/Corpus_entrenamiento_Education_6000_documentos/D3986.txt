#ITI#The effect of differentiated science module application on the scientific reasoning and scientific process skills of gifted students in a blended learning environment#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this study is to examine the effect of the science module which was designed using the problem-based learning method on the basis of the Integrated Curriculum Model and applied in the blended learning environment on the scientific reasoning and scientific process skills of gifted students. The study was carried out with 9 gifted 5th grade students studying in an institution that provides support education for the gifted in Turkey. The case study method was used in the study which lasted 8 weeks. The science module was implemented in a blended learning environment. Qualitative data were obtained through reflective diaries and semi-structured interview form. In addition to the qualitative method, a single group pre-test post-test experimental design was used as a quantitative method, quantitative data were obtained with the ‘Scientific Process Skills Test’ and ‘Lawson Scientific Reasoning Test’ and analyzed with a statistical program. In the research findings, it was observed that there was a significant difference in favour of the post-test in the pre-test and post-test scores. The students stated that they used reasoning in identifying a problem in the activities, thinking about ways to solve the problem, and developing a design for the solution#FRE#
