#ITI#Implementing a 1:1 technology program in a rural, public school: a study of perceptions of technology integration#FTI#
#IRE# Rural communities face unique challenges that can complicate technological integration and impact the effectiveness of 1:1 technology initiatives. The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore teachers’ and administrators’ perceptions of technology integration after implementing a 1:1 initiative in a rural, public district. Three primary themes emerged. First, the combination of technology and pedagogy is an essential part of 1:1 program success. Secondly, technology must be combined with content knowledge. Finally, there are benefits and challenges of rural settings. Students gain experiences, and schools see increased student engagement. However, lower levels of connectivity and longer bus rides impact students’ ability to complete their work. Support received at home is impacted by parental hesitancy and a lower level of technical ability of the parents#FRE#
