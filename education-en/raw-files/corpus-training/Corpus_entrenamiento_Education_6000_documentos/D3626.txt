#ITI#Evaluating the usefulness of a wordless picture book for adults with intellectual disabilities about the COVID-19 vaccination programme using co-production: The CAREVIS study#FTI#
#IRE#Aim: To explore the usefulness of a co-designed wordless book showing processes of receiving COVID-19 vaccines designed by, and for, adults with intellectual disabilities. Methods: A qualitative evaluation of the resource using mixed methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people with intellectual disabilities, carers and health professionals about resource content, and use. This was analysed thematically. A survey was circulated to intellectual disabilities networks to understand resource need, use, sharing and content. Results: Understanding the COVID-19 vaccine was a process, not a single event using one resource. A visual resource had a place in facilitating conversations about vaccines between people with intellectual disabilities and carers. Differing perspectives were expressed regarding personal needs, existing awareness of vaccine programmes and communication preferences. Changes were suggested to improve the suggested storyline and relevance around COVID-19 restrictions changing. Conclusion: A visual resource may help conversations about the COVID-19 vaccine for people with intellectual disabilities#FRE#
