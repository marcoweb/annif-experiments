#ITI#A scoping review on the psychometric properties of the teacher efficacy for inclusive practices (TEIP) scale#FTI#
#IRE#Teachers’ self-efficacy for inclusion is emphasized as necessary for enabling inclusive education. One instrument developed for measuring teacher self-efficacy for inclusion is the Teacher Efficacy for Inclusion Practice-scale (TEIP) (Sharma, U., Loreman, T., & Forlin, C. (2012). Measuring teacher efficacy to implement inclusive practices. Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs, 12(1), 12–21). The present study aimed to identify and summarize the empirical literature on structural validation and reliability of the TEIP scale. A scoping review of 15 peer-review articles was conducted. The three subscales found in the original TEIP scale were confirmed. However, there is support for two subscales. The TEIP is also reported to be a construct without multidimensional constructs of teacher-self efficacy. Although the items worked differently in different samples, the internal consistency was generally sufficient or good. Our findings indicate that the TEIP is not yet a scale fit for comparisons between populations and contexts, reflecting the multifaceted nature of the concept of both inclusion and teacher self-efficacy#FRE#
