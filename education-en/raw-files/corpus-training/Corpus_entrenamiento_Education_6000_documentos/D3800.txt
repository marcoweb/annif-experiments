#ITI#Music Uses in Preschool Classrooms in the U.S.: A Multiple-Methods Study#FTI#
#IRE#This study reports preschool educators’ uses of music in educational settings, as well as challenges faced in incorporating music in the classroom in the U.S. Through a multiple-methods approach, data from two focus groups (N1 = 8, N2 = 6) and a survey (N = 119) are used to gain insight into how frequently preschool educators in the US use various types of music activities in their classrooms, for what purposes they do so, and what challenges they face in doing so. This study also sheds light on the current linguistic landscape of a sample of early childhood and care settings in the US, highlighting the importance of music activities as a tool to engage and teach children whose home language is different from the instructional language of English. Results indicate that preschool educators use music on a daily basis, for both academic and social-emotional purposes. Additionally, educators who have linguistically diverse students tend to use music more than those who have all English speakers in their classrooms. Finally, educators reported facing several challenges in accessing the necessary resources to lead music activities effectively in their classrooms#FRE#
