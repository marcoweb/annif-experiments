#ITI#Praise publicly, correct privately: how secondary teachers cultivate school belonging and classroom community#FTI#
#IRE#School belonging is characterised by the constructive relationships shared between teachers and students in the learning environment. When students feel bonded to their teachers, they demonstrate greater school satisfaction, are highly engaged, and are more likely to persist. In this investigation, the nature of school belonging was examined using the tenets of self-determination theory to illuminate teachers’ perceptions of the quality of their relationships with students. Eleven high school teachers kept reflective journals about their experiences building a sense of classroom community with adolescents of various developmental needs. Emergent themes placed importance on rapport and positive regard, active and empathetic listening, and being responsive to students’ developmental needs#FRE#
