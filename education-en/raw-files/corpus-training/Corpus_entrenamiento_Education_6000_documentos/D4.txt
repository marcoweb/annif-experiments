#ITI#Secondary special education co-teachers in the United States and specialised reading instruction for adolescents with disabilities#FTI#
#IRE# When secondary students with disabilities are in co-taught classes, they still need to receive specialised reading instruction when it is stipulated on their Individualised Education Program. However, previous research reveals over two-thirds of secondary special education co-teachers focus instead on using modifications and accommodations. Although modifications and accommodations can meet the short-term need for students’ reading, they do not meet students’ long-term need for independent and proficient reading. In this study, middle and high school special education co-teachers report about specialised reading instruction for adolescents with disabilities whose Individualised Education Programs stipulate this need. Co-teachers completed an online survey about the provision of specialised reading instruction for students with disabilities in co-taught classes. Descriptive analyses indicate that half of the co-teachers are concerned students need more specialised reading instruction than that provided during co-taught classes, with almost one-third noting concern such instruction did not occur at any time during the school day. Results are similar to those obtained almost a decade ago, indicating that many secondary special education co-teachers continue to address students’ reading needs through accommodations and modifications rather than providing reading instruction that promotes students’ independence. Implications for specialised reading instruction for secondary students with disabilities are identified#FRE#
