#ITI#Exploring the social care-related quality of life outcomes of adults with intellectual disabilities through the use of Talking Mats®#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Views on social care related quality of life (SCRQol) are typically gathered directly from individuals or from proxy informants. Easy-read options are available, although such methods may not be accessible to those with greater communication challenges. Methods: Fifteen people with intellectual disabilities were interviewed about their SCRQoL using Talking Mats® (TM). A descriptive approach was taken to exploring what people had to say. Results: Participants reported high levels of satisfaction with living conditions and personal care routines. They were mostly satisfied with the level of choice and control they had and with their carers. Conclusions: People with intellectual disabilities who have greater communication challenges can make meaningful contributions to the assessment of the care they receive. Talking Mats is one tool which can be used to support people with intellectual disabilities to give their views#FRE#
