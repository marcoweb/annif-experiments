#ITI#Who Is the White Antiracist Student? An Exploratory Investigation of Individual Characteristics#FTI#
#IRE#Antiracism education can be a transformative experience for White college students. However, the process of learning can engender strong reactions (e.g., defensiveness) that disrupts participation. Though some White students are more successful in moving closer toward an antiracist position, little is known about this group. This gap in knowledge is concerning given that the design and effectiveness of antiracism education is potentially contingent on understanding the makeup of White antiracist students and characteristics that may contribute to their antiracist development. Thus, the purpose of this study was to elucidate the characteristics of White antiracist college students. Particularly, White-identified college students (N = 259) were categorized into an antiracist or nonantiracist group and assessed for group differences across several individual characteristics. The findings suggest that White antiracist college students differed from nonantiracist White students in important ways that may empirically inform antiracism education and aid the work of antiracism college educators#FRE#
