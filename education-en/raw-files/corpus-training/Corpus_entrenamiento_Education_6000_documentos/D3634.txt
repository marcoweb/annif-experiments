#ITI#Personal support networks of young people with and without intellectual disability. A comparative study#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Previous studies show that the personal support networks of people with intellectual disability are smaller and less diverse than those of people without intellectual disability. This article aims to compare the characteristics of the personal networks of young people with and without intellectual disability. Method: The Personal Network Analysis (McCarty, Revista Hispana Para El Análisis de Redes Sociales, 2010, 19, 242–271) was applied. The participants comprised 51 young people aged between 13 and 19, of whom 27 had an intellectual disability. The Egonet programme was used to compile information, and SPSS v.27 for the statistical analysis. Results: Young people with intellectual disabilities have smaller personal networks than people without disability, while they also comprise more people with disability and fewer ‘friends’ and support people. Conclusions: The full social inclusion of people with intellectual disability requires schools, families, the community and the individual to work together to develop activities that help them initiate and maintain relationships, prioritising mainstream contexts#FRE#
