#ITI#Integrating Urban Schools in a Modern Context: Roadblocks and Challenges With the Use of Magnet Schools#FTI#
#IRE# It has been 50 years since magnet schools were first used to address segregation in public schools. The context of magnet schools has changed dramatically during this time, raising questions about the role of magnet schools in a modern context. This study utilized data from a large urban district with more than 100 magnet schools to assess integration from magnet schools in a modern context. The results point to integration in magnet schools, but this integration comes at the cost of segregating the traditional public schools in the district. Interdistrict transfers could improve the integrative capacity of magnet schools.#FRE#
