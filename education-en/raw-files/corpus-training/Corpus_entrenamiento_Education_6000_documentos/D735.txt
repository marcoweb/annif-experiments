#ITI#Experiences and challenges related to wellbeing faced by Australian higher degree research candidates prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic#FTI#
#IRE# Higher degree research candidates experience higher rates of anxiety and depression than the general population. This study explored the wellbeing and experiences of two independent groups of HDR candidates. One participating prior to the pandemic, and the second group during the COVID-19 pandemic. A mixed methods study comprising of a survey and focus group were conducted with 17 participants. The results of this preliminary study suggest there may have been differences in HDR candidates’ wellbeing between pre-pandemic and those participating in the study during COVID-19. However, the study sample was small, and the results cannot be generalised to the HDR cohort. Two main themes were identified from the focus groups: ‘wellbeing challenges, culture and connectivity’ and ‘university response: culture and connectivity’. Some participants identified multiple stressors that impacted their wellbeing including challenges of establishing a research community to support their voice, and identity. Additional challenges that related to connectivity were evident for international students during COVID-19, due to international border closures in Australia. Further studies are needed to inform evidence-based policies#FRE#
