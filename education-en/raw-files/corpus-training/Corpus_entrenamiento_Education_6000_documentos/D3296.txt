#ITI#An Exploration of How Students Prioritize Help-Seeking Sources in Online Learning Environments#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this study is to analyze how undergraduate learners seek academic help online at a public university in the United States with Q methodology. Upon completion of the study, we identified three groups of help-seekers. The first group, informal and personal help-seekers, sought help from close friends or classmates to solve problems. The second group, formal and impersonal help-seekers, relied on instructors as their primary source of help, followed by instructional materials such as course websites, syllabi, and rubrics. The participants in the third group expressed a significant reluctance to seek help from instructors and preferred alternative options like tutoring centers, search engines, and discussion boards. Contradicting opinions about help-seeking sources existed, with reasons explored. Implications and recommendations for future studies were also discussed. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2024.#FRE#
