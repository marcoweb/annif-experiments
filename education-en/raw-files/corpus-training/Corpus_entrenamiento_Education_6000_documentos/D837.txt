#ITI#Health occupations salary outcomes: intersections of student race, gender, and first-generation status#FTI#
#IRE# Greater diversity in the healthcare workforce has been identified as a critical need in serving an increasingly diverse population. Higher education institutions have been tasked with increasing the number of underrepresented students in the health occupations pipeline to better align with the demographics of the general population and meet the need for a diverse health occupations workforce. This study used the National Science Foundation’s National Survey of College Graduates dataset to capture data across time, examining the intersectionality of race, gender, and first-generation status on the salary outcomes of students who earn degrees related to health occupations. Results indicate that the intersecting identities of students who earn a bachelor’s degree or higher in the health professions impact salary outcomes. Results of this study have implications for higher education policies that can impact increased diversity in the health occupations workforce pipeline#FRE#
