#ITI#PRN usage before and after discharge from a forensic inpatient unit: A series example of patients with intellectual disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Adults living with intellectual and developmental disabilities are often prescribed psychotropic medication on an “as needed” basis (PRN) in response to behavioural challenges. In the present study we conducted a retrospective analysis of medication administration records in the 6-months preceding and following discharge of 11 adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities to community settings from forensic inpatient units within a mental health hospital. We found a significant reduction in the frequency of PRN usage after discharge. We propose potential reasons for the difference in PRN administration across settings and make suggestions for future research#FRE#
