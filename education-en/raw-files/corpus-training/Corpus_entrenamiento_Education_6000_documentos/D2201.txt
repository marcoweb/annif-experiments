#ITI#Engaging students via synchronous peer feedback in a technology-enhanced learning environment#FTI#
#IRE# Synchronous peer feedback activity is a potential but less studied strategy to engage students in technology-enhanced learning environments compared to asynchronous peer feedback activity in which students provide feedback to each other at a different time. This study aims to investigate student engagement and perceptions in a Google Forms-facilitated synchronous peer feedback activity during student-led presentations, which are a critical part of students’ academic and professional development. This study employed an exploratory case study method. Participants were two class sections of undergraduate students who enrolled in an introductory educational technology course. Data included feedback generated by students, student reflections, and a survey. Results indicated that students were engaged behaviorally, affectively, and cognitively. Students had overall positive perceptions of the integration of Google Forms. This study suggests that technology-enhanced synchronous peer feedback activity is a beneficial instructional strategy to engage students in classes. Implications for practice and future research are provided#FRE#
