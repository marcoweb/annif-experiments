#ITI#Deep Learning Becomes a Reality when Emerging Technologies Meet Learning Design#FTI#
#IRE#A design case is a form of scholarly writing in which the author embarks on a reflective journey sharing rich descriptions of their design, design processes, challenges, etc. This paper presents two design cases that demonstrate how learning theories and instructional design concepts were purposefully incorporated in two instructional applications utilizing Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). The first case used AR to convert a face-to-face construction site safety analysis assignment to an online assignment for an online undergraduate course. In the second case, VR was utilized for construction site safety training for construction professionals. This paper will discuss how learning theories and frameworks were adhered to when designing and developing the applications to promote deep learning - in-depth learner engagement and positive learning outcomes and experiences. It aims to advocate for a learning design approach and mindset that is first and foremost driven by pedagogy rather than technology#FRE#
