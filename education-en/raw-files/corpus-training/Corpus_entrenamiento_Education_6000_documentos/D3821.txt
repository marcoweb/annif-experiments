#ITI#Effect of Problem Behaviors on Early Literacy Skills: A Malaysian Experience#FTI#
#IRE#Problem behaviors have often been associated with poor learning in preschool children. However, most of these studies have mainly been situated in Western contexts. The current study, based on a single case study of a Malaysian preschool, explores the link between problem behaviors and early literacy skills of preschool children aged between 4 and 5 from a non-Western context. Fifty-two boys and forty girls were recruited for the study. The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to assess children’s problem behaviors via teacher reports. Literacy skills were obtained through pupil progress reports. Family background and home literacy environment information were provided by the primary caregivers using a survey instrument. Findings indicated that only attentional difficulties were associated with early learning in young children. Other problem behaviors such as emotional, conduct and peer problems did not predict early literacy skills. This study added new knowledge to the discourse used in a non-Western context. The findings bear important practical implications for optimizing the early learning experiences of preschoolers. Educators should consider children’s specific behavioral challenges and formulate early interventions such as Social Emotional Learning (SEL) programs to be integrated into preschool programs. More importantly, policies should make developing good attentional skills a priority in the early years programs#FRE#
