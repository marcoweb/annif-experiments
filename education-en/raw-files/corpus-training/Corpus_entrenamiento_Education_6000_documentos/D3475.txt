#ITI#Challenges of single parents raising children with intellectual and developmental disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Single-parent families with children with disabilities need greater attention given the notable increase in their number and their additional difficulties. Single parents in East Asian countries, especially, may face greater risks than their peers elsewhere, given the region's unique cultural background. Method: The study used a mixed methods design; we administered a risk assessment survey to 354 families of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities and conducted in-depth interviews with eight single parents. Results: Compared to two-parent families, single-parent families faced greater risks with respect to family relationships, economic status and legal rights. In the interviews, single parents reported a range of challenges, including sole parental responsibilities, poor physical and mental health, social isolation and alienation, the stress of juggling care and work, and difficulty accessing services. Conclusion: These findings offer implications for future policy and practices concerning single parents in South Korea#FRE#
