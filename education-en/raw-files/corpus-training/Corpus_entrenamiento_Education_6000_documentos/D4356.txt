#ITI#The coalition model for professional development#FTI#
#IRE#The Coalition Model for Professional Development (CMfPD) was created to develop capacity in a network of adult and continuing education (A&CE) staff from eight district school boards in the eastern Ontario region in Canada. The CMfPD had three main components: 1) a collaborative structure, 2) continuous learning and 3) a culture of care. Interviews were conducted with twenty-two network members to explore their experiences with the CMfPD. Qualitative analysis of interview data revealed positive professional development (PD) experiences associated with model components. In addition, network members reported professional growth as a result of the CMfPD, with respect to increasing their capacity, promoting collaboration with their colleagues and preparing them to enact change in the field of A&CE. The importance of this PD model is discussed in relation to how its components helped mobilise the collective work of a newly formed education coalition dedicated to system-wide change#FRE#
