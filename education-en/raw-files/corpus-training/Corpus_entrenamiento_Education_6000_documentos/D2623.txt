#ITI#Improving teaching practices via virtual reality-supported simulation-based learning: Scenario design and the duration of implementation#FTI#
#IRE# Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs), or student instructors, are the crucial force in college for undergraduates' learning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) disciplines. However, professional development of student instructors is often neglected. Providing adequate and appropriate teacher training for student instructors is a critical challenge. When the technology is available, open-source non-immersive virtual reality (VR) can be a cost-efficient and accessible platform for teacher training. Empirical research of designing and implementing VR for the training on teaching knowledge and skills development is inconclusive and thus warranted. In this ex post facto study, we investigated VR-based teacher training with 33 STEM student instructors to explore the effects on the participants' virtual teaching practices of two design factors: (1) the simulated teaching scenario and (2) the duration of training program implementation. We analysed 7604 event logs from the recordings of their virtual teaching sessions. The results of ordinal logistic regression analyses showed two factors contributed to higher odds of appropriate teaching actions. The first is the simulated scenarios that induced a more dynamic balance of domain-specific and pedagogical knowledge for decision making in teaching; the second is the teacher training program with a longer duration. Practitioner notes What is already know about this topic Teacher training, especially for college graduate teaching assistants in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) disciplines, is a key for the success of undergraduate students in STEM. Virtual reality (VR)-supported simulation-based learning has been found effective for enhancing knowledge and skills development in diverse settings, including when being used for teacher training. What this paper adds A guiding framework for the investigation of scenario design and duration of implementation in VR-supported teacher training. VR scenarios that encourage more dynamic balance of domain-specific and pedagogical knowledge for decision making in teaching have higher odds for appropriate teaching acts. A longer duration of program implementation in VR can result in higher odds for appropriate teaching acts. Implications for practice We should carefully consider appropriate scenario designs in VR to enhance dynamic decision making and interactivity in simulation-based teaching practices for teacher training. We encourage extended duration of VR teacher training programs to facilitate teachers' observant, autonomous and attentive VR-based micro teaching practices#FRE#
