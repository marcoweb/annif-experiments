#ITI#The Political and Social Contexts of Research Evidence Use in Partnerships#FTI#
#IRE# This article discusses what we know about the underlying social and political conditions shaping research evidence use in education and how this applies to Research-Practice Partnerships (RPPs). It discusses types of use, political dynamics and processes, brokers and intermediaries, and racial dynamics and lenses. It also recommends strategies for RPPs in light of these political and social contexts to improve the quality of use and reduce the misuse of research evidence, ending with implications for future research.#FRE#
