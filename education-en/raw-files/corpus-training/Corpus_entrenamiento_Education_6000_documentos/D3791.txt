#ITI#Teaching Early Writing: Supporting Early Writers from Preschool to Elementary School#FTI#
#IRE#Writing skills grow along a predictable developmental trajectory, yet what is considered “writing” can look very different in preschool and early elementary classrooms. The way in which writing may look in each setting reflects that teachers are working with different sets of learning standards, with different conceptualizations of writing to inform their pedagogical decisions (Tortorelli et al., Reading Research Quarterly, 57(2), 729–752, 2021). These differences translate into varied expectations for what young children are capable of and how these skills should be supported (Tortorelli et al., Reading Research Quarterly, 57(2), 729–752, 2021). We recommend that across the 3–6 age band teachers provide meaningful writing experiences that link composing with writing concepts and transcription skills. This article provides concrete instructional strategies to support an integrative approach to writing and includes guidance for writing concepts, handwriting, spelling, and composing to support a successful preschool to kindergarten writing transition for children#FRE#
