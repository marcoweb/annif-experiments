#ITI#Innovative learning spaces: class management and universal design for learning#FTI#
#IRE#Recent and important changes in pedagogy design include flexible learning methods that address student diversity (universal design for learning–UDL) and innovative learning spaces. The goals of this study were (1) to compare pedagogical practices in traditional and innovative learning environments in the context of the management dimension of classroom climate; (2) to measure the correlation between teacher-centered and student-centered learning and number of classroom discipline events; and (3) to measure the effect of select UDL principles and innovative learning spaces on the relationship between the rate of expression of teacher-centered learning and number of classroom discipline events. A total of 507 observations were carried out to document classroom pedagogical and discipline management, 265 (52%) in traditional classrooms and 242 (48%) in the innovative learning spaces of four elementary schools in the same geographical region. The rate of student-centered learning and pedagogical practices that express UDL principles was significantly higher in innovative spaces than in traditional classes. A moderate, positive and significant correlation was found between teacher-centered learning and number of classroom discipline events. In addition, the learning space, integration of tasks that encourage choice, and integration of tasks that address learners’ differences were found as significant moderating variables of the relationship between teacher-centered learning and the number of classroom discipline events. The study provides an in-depth understanding of the relationships that exist between the applications of several pedagogical practices and discipline that are important for development of similar innovative learning space initiatives regionally and beyond#FRE#
