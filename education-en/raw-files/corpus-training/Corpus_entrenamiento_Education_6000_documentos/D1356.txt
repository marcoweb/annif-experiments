#ITI#Investigating the design, participation and experience of teaching and learning facilitated by user-generated microgames on an open educational platform#FTI#
#IRE# Although user-generated microgames, defined as very simple games made by non-professionals on open platforms, are popular and appear to have considerable advantages in facilitating learning, further exploration is needed to establish their potential in instructional practices. The present study investigates the design, participation and experience of teaching and learning facilitated by user-generated microgames on an open educational platform. Through an exploratory experiment research method, four elementary school teachers designed and implemented microgame-based learning utilising these very small games on GeoGebra Classroom attended by 129 students. Data were gathered from lesson plans, classroom activity records and self-reflection questionnaires. This study revealed that teachers designed learning with various user-generated microgames and debriefing methods respecting learning content, but they shared comparatively similar scenarios by inserting microgame-based learning into the middle of the main session. The completion rate for the debriefing activity is minimum although the total joining times overshoot the number of students. Teachers found that user-generated microgames are acceptable to orchestrate short serious gaming sessions even though they are limited to one player with basic interfaces. Notwithstanding several disadvantages of these microgames recognised by students, such as missing learning instructions and inadequate interfaces, they so far enjoy learning by playing the games. The most critical implication of this study is to provide sufficient instructions and additional time for microgaming sessions in elementary schools to ensure sustainable completion of the briefing, playing and debriefing activities.#FRE#
