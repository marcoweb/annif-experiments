#ITI#Teaching refugee and forced immigrant youth: lessons from the United States#FTI#
#IRE#This study explores the needs and preparedness of teachers of refugees and forced immigrant (RFI) students in the United States. Research examining the role and influence of teachers on RFIs in education systems is sparse. As a result, there is a critical shortage of an evidence base and subsequent resources, strategies, and policies on teacher training and professional development in the US to support the unique academic and non-academic needs of these students related to trauma, identity and language (TIDAL). Interviews were conducted with education professionals in the United States, specifically the states of Ohio and New Jersey, related to their expectations and needs for working with RFI youth. Results of this study show that educators lack training and support for working with the increasingly diverse population of RFI students. Utilising the capabilities approach, the analysis suggests that proactive change at the macro-level, which activates organisational support, and institutionalising policy related to TIDAL are needed at the meso and micro-levels. Not only does change at these levels provide legitimacy to the needs of RFI students, but it also acknowledges the needs of educators, the work they are actively doing, and the importance of providing quality education to all students#FRE#
