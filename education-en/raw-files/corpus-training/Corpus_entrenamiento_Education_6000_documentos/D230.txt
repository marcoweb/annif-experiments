#ITI#Assessing the Predictive Validity of the Massachusetts Candidate Assessment of Performance#FTI#
#IRE# We evaluate the predictive validity of the Massachusetts Candidate Assessment of Performance (CAP), a practice-based assessment of teaching skills that is now a requirement for teacher preparation program completion in Massachusetts. We find that candidates’ performance on the CAP significantly predicts their in-service summative performance evaluations in their first 2 years in the teaching workforce, but it is not predictive of their value added to student test scores in these years. These findings suggest that the CAP captures aspects of candidates’ skills and competencies that are better reflected in their future performance evaluations than by their impacts on student performance.#FRE#
