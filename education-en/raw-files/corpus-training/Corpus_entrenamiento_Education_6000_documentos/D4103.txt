#ITI#Understanding city dynamics: using geolocated social media in a problem-based activity as an investigative tool to enhance student learning#FTI#
#IRE#Research that tackles the pedagogical use of geolocated social media as an investigative tool for understanding cities in Geography and Urban Studies higher education programs has not been fully exploited. This study contributes by addressing the transferability of these sources as a research medium for enhancing student knowledge of urban phenomena. A collaborative problem-based learning activity was conducted in a third-year compulsory Urban Studies module of the Fundamentals in Architecture Degree at the University of Alicante. Two groups–Spanish (25 students) and English (34 students) language, participated in the activity. Foursquare and Twitter datasets were used as sources of information, and scaffolding in QGIS software, data analysis, and visualization tools were provided. Pre- and post- activity questionnaires as well as the work submitted by students gave an indication of the extent to which the activity was useful for achieving the set objective. Recurring approaches adopted by students and their “how-to” make sense of social media information enabled them to align spatiotemporal and social phenomena to the use and perception of city spaces. Students developed critical thinking and interpretative skills that are key transversal competencies for understanding the huge volume of data available in today’s digitalized world#FRE#
