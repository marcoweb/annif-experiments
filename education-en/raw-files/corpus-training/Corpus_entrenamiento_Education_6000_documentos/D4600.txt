#ITI#Evaluating empowerment towards responsible conduct of research in a small private online course#FTI#
#IRE#Teaching Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) has gained recognition in recent years, with various organizations emphasizing the need to take responsibility in training their researchers in RCR. However, differing perspectives on RCR education result in a variety of practices, making it unclear what approach is most effective. As part of two European projects on research integrity education, we have developed an empowerment perspective on RCR education and incorporated this in an online course design. This paper presents the design and qualitative evaluation of a Small Private Online Course (SPOC) that aims to empower participants towards RCR. Results show the course enhanced individual aspects of empowerment, but it proved difficult to stimulate social aspects of empowerment in researchers day-to-day work#FRE#
