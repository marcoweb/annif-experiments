#ITI#A site of radical possibilities: Examining how a multigenerational counterspace promoted STEM persistence among undergraduate Women of Color#FTI#
#IRE# Women from racially/ethnically minoritized communities remain significantly underrepresented at all levels of education in STEM. The pervasive white and heteronormative culture of the STEM environment has contributed to Women of Color feeling isolated, hyper-visible, and invisible as they contend with racism, sexism, and gendered racial microaggressions. Scholars have found that counterspaces are key sites to support the persistence of Women of Color in STEM and ameliorate the negative psychological effects of navigating oppressive STEM milieus. Missing from the current literature is research on how counterspaces contribute to Women of Color's STEM persistence. This study sought to fill this gap in the literature by understanding the experiences of undergraduate Women of Color in the I CAN PERSIST STEM initiative, a multigenerational counterspace designed to support the holistic persistence of Women of Color in STEM. Steeped in the theoretical conceptualization of counterspaces, and using a case study methodological approach, we found that the multigenerational counter-storytelling and support from Women of Color in STEM, as well as the embodiment of holistic wellness, and justice-focused mentor-teaching supported STEM persistence intentions among undergraduate Women of Color in the sample. Furthermore, participants described being able to reconcile their STEM identities with their need to be active in addressing and mitigating the inequities in their communities, while also prioritizing their well-being and rejecting the STEM culture of overwork and burnout#FRE#
