#ITI#The Role of Trust in Perceptions of the Sexual Assault Reporting Climate for LGBQ College Students#FTI#
#IRE#Sexual assault is a problem on college campuses that disproportionately impacts lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer/questioning (LGBQ) students. Civil rights law requires that institutions of higher education in the United States (U.S.) have a system in place to address sexual assault and provide accommodations and assistance to survivors, however, few students report such incidents to college officials. This study explores how trust in campus support systems is associated with perceptions of the campus sexual assault reporting climate (SARC) when controlling for community readiness to address sexual assault in the LGBQ community, exposure to training, and a sense of belonging for LGBQ students. A sample of 775 LGBQ college students from across the U.S. was recruited using social media strategies. Results of hierarchical multiple regression showed that trust in campus support systems predicted SARC above and beyond community readiness, exposure to training, and sense of belonging. All independent variables were also significantly associated with the reporting climate. Findings from this study contribute to the understanding of how LGBQ college students perceive the campus community will respond to reports of sexual assault. Implications for policy and practice are discusse#FRE#
