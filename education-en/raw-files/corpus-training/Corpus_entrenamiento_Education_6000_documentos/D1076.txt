#ITI#Micro-processes of knowledge sharing in higher education: international students as a source#FTI#
#IRE# International students are fundamental actors in the university’s knowledge management process, but little is known about their knowledge activities. The purpose of this study is to understand how the knowledge sharing process in higher education unfolds in the context of international students’ perspectives. Based on a qualitative approach, data were collected through interviews with Chinese international students studying at Russian universities. The results of this study were synthesized into a proposed process model for knowledge sharing, describing the activities and four stages related to knowledge sharing by international students. This study found that the relative weights of influencing factors vary across the four stages of knowledge sharing and that international students’ knowledge sharing is an iterative process that occurs in an incremental way. As a result, the study reveals the knowledge source role of international students, and extends the existing knowledge-sharing model to more accurately reflect the micro-processes of international students’ knowledge sharing. Future research can examine the applicability of the identified micro-processes in different higher education contexts. Based on the different needs of international students in the four stages identified in this study, leaders can facilitate knowledge management in higher education#FRE#
