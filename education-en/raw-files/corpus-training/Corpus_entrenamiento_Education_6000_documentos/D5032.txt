#ITI#The Need for More Alliances in Advocating for, With, and to Others in Higher Education#FTI#
#IRE#Though advocacy and activism have been frequent topics of research, few studies explore this work across campus roles, meaning inclusive of students, faculty, and staff. A more holistic understanding of advocacy would pave the way for more effective social justice efforts. Researchers used hermeneutic phenomenology to engage with 26 advocates finding that identity influences advocacy; advocates work for, with, and to others; and advocates take risks with consequences associated with their identities. The American Counseling Association’s Advocacy Competencies extended the analysis to reveal the lack of alliances in cross-campus advocacy#FRE#
