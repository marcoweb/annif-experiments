#IRE#All children, particularly those with special needs, have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study explored the experiences of children with learning disabilities (LD) during the COVID-19 Pandemic. A criterion sample of twenty-three children ages 7 to 10 (M = 8.56, SD = 1.12) from Turkey was interviewed. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the collected data. Three themes were generated: 1) Perceived changes in Children’s Daily Lives, 2) Educational Process, and 3) Support During the Pandemic. Overall, findings from the present study provided insights into children’s experiences with LD during the COVID-19 pandemic#FRE#
