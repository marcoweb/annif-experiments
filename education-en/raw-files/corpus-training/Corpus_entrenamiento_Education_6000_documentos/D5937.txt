#ITI#Digital micro-credentials in environmental science: an employer perspective on valued evidence of skills#FTI#
#IRE#To advance the employability agenda in higher education, we need new ideas for embedding career skills into university curricula and novel tools for articulating the capabilities of learners. Situated in the discipline of environmental science, the aim of this study was to examine employer perceptions of the skills needed for a career in the sector and the utility of micro-credentials in recognising and recruiting graduates. Through in-depth interviews with 22 environmental professionals in three Australian states/territories, we found that employers use multiple lines of evidence when recruiting for new positions and that alternative sources of information are highly valued in their decision-making. Questions about the utility of micro-credentials in this process centred around a case study in environmental science. While there was strong support and enthusiasm for the micro-credential and broad approach, employers needed further context about how micro-credentials can be used, and confidence in the rigour and standards applied#FRE#
