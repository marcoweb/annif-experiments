#ITI#The arts in environmental education: connecting learners with their talents and nature#FTI#
#IRE#Small Island Developing States (SIDS) such as those in the Caribbean are vulnerable to environmental threats. Engaging pedagogic strategies are needed to connect students with nature and energise them to take pro-environmental actions. This qualitative case study explored the use of art to connect students with nature in an undergraduate environmental education (EE) course in Jamaica. Participants from different disciplines but with primarily a science background created environmental art products as one of three assessment tasks. Data were collected from the students’ written descriptions of their art products along with semi-structured interviews. A range of creative items were produced, which along with the written descriptions demonstrated varied methods of expressing personal impressions of environmental issues. The interview data revealed that the undergraduate students had positive experiences with creating eco-art products, despite being initially hesitant due to misconceptions about different types of art forms and a lack of confidence in their artistic ability to create them. Students’ descriptions of their artistic creations depicted their connections with their environment, elicited emotions and unlocked their desire to protect the environment. These findings support using the arts as a pedagogic strategy for enhancing understanding, fostering positive attitudes and encouraging desirable action towards the environment among undergraduate students in an EE course#FRE#
