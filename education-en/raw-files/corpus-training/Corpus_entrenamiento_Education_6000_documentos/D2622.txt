#ITI#Analytics-supported reflective assessment for 6th graders' knowledge building and data science practices: An exploratory study#FTI#
#IRE# Preparing data-literate citizens and supporting future generations to effectively work with data is challenging. Engaging students in Knowledge Building (KB) may be a promising way to respond to this challenge because it requires students to reflect on and direct their inquiry with the support of data. Informed by previous studies, this research explored how an analytics-supported reflective assessment (AsRA)-enhanced KB design influenced 6th graders' KB and data science practices in a science education setting. One intact class with 56 students participated in this study. The analysis of students' Knowledge Forum discourse showed the positive influences of the AsRA-enhanced KB design on students' development of KB and data science practices. Further analysis of different-performing groups revealed that the AsRA-enhanced KB design was accessible to all performing groups. These findings have important implications for teachers and researchers who aim to develop students' KB and data science practices, and general high-level collaborative inquiry skills. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Data use becomes increasingly important in the K-12 educational context. Little is known about how to scaffold students to develop data science practices. Knowledge Building (KB) and learning analytics-supported reflective assessment (AsRA) show premises in developing these practices. What this paper adds AsRA-enhanced KB can help students improve KB and data science practices over time. AsRA-enhanced KB design benefits students of different-performing groups. AsRA-enhanced KB is accessible to elementary school students in science education. Implications for practice and/or policy Developing a collaborative and reflective culture helps students engage in collaborative inquiry. Pedagogical approaches and analytic tools can be developed to support students' data-driven decision-making in inquiry learning#FRE#
