#ITI#Mixed-methods approaches to learning strategies and self-regulation in Physical Education: a literature review#FTI#
#IRE# Introduction: Students’ learning strategies and self-regulation processes are considered highly important in academic and Physical Education contexts. Educational researchers have called for mixed-method designs to investigate how students learn and not only what they learn. The aim of this literature review was to analyze the use of mixed-method designs in self-regulated learning research in a physical education setting. Methods: The following databases were searched for relevant articles: ERIC, Persee, PsycInfo and Scopus. No date range was specified and keywords for the search included learning strategies, self-regulated learning, Physical Education, mixed-method, qualitative and quantitative analysis. Thirteen articles were selected and classified according to their theoretical framework. The last stage of selection extended the literature review in each theoretical framework. Results: The results show that mixed-method design is relevant when researchers need findings on how students learn, and not only on what they learn. The use of mixed methods is well suited to the Information Processing, Self-Regulated Learning and Student Approaches of Learning theoretical traditions#FRE#
