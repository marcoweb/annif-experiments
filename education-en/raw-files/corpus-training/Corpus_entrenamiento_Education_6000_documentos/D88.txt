#ITI#Transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary programmes for collaborative graduate research training#FTI#
#IRE# This paper documents a case study examining collaborative transdisciplinary (TD) and interdisciplinary (ID) graduate programmes at the University of British Columbia (a large, public, research-intensive university in Canada)–serving as a model for other universities globally. TD and ID programmes in higher education can ultimately create a new generation of researchers who are capable of contending with complex problems by equipping them with a broad range of research competencies and expertise. This study used open-ended surveys and semi-structured focus groups and interviews to understand how students, faculty members, and programme coordinators experienced these programmes, focusing on specific competencies (e.g. values, knowledge, interpersonal skills). We then highlighted how programmes may be preparing students to engage in collaborative applied research (i.e., TD and ID) in real-world contexts. Our findings suggest that “breadth” programmes exposed students to a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, while “depth” programmes focused on a specific research problem in fewer disciplines. TD and ID co-supervision and thesis committee membership emerged as rich avenues for students to receive mentorship from faculty members. Lastly, respondents wanted more applied research and opportunities to connect with potential employers outside academia#FRE#
