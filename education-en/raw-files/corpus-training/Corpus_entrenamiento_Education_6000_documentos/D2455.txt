#ITI#Teaching science to transgress: Portraits of feminist praxis#FTI#
#IRE# Drawing from intersectional feminist scholarship, we communicate how Salina and Marelis, both women of color, teach science for social justice in the face of significant institutional challenges. Theorizing from their experiences and practices, we articulate a feminist praxis for school science, which includes (1) building community and collectivist orientations, (2) cultivating joy from/within the margins, (3) naming and dismantling inequities, and (4) repositioning students—practices that have profound implications for improving the school science experiences of underrepresented students in science, including girls of color and other marginalized students. Finally, we highlight the ways in which women of color negotiate, repurpose, and transform institutional and disciplinary barriers to reimagine the world(s) of school science#FRE#
