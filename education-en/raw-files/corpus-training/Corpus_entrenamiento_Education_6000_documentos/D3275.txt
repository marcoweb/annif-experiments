#ITI#The use of the Video Platform FlipGrid for Practicing Science Oral Communication#FTI#
#IRE#Oral communication and presentation skills are considered key competencies for many academic fields and professions, including science-related ones. Therefore, it is vital that students are given sufficient class time in the curriculum for practicing public speaking. It is well documented in the literature that video technology can be of valuable aid in enhancing oral skills, and FlipGrid is a relatively new video discussion platform that has become popular for this purpose. The aim of this study is two-fold. First, the literature regarding FlipGrid is explored to understand how educators around the globe use the platform. Second, a case study is presented where FlipGrid is used and evaluated as a tool for practicing and assessing oral science communication. A mixed-method approach was used to evaluate FlipGrid with the participation of 112 students. Findings indicate that although the use FlipGrid in science fields is limited, it can be a useful platform for practicing oral science communication#FRE#
