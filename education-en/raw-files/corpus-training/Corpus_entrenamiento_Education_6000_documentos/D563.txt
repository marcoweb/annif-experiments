#ITI#Surfacing Deep Challenges for Social-Educational Justice: Putting Funds, Wealth, and Capital Frameworks into Dialogue#FTI#
#IRE# This paper critically explores theoretical, conceptual, and methodological dimensions of three social-justice oriented educational approaches: Bourdieuian Analysis of Capital (BAC), Funds of Knowledge (FK), and Community Cultural Wealth (CCW). We surface convergences and divergences across these three frameworks, seeking to clarify them conceptually, draw out implications for educational praxis, illuminate importantly difficult tensions in-and-across them, and (re)imagine future directions for utilizing these frameworks to address intersecting structural inequalities in the pursuit of strengthened social-educational justice. We argue that putting BAC, FK, and CCW into mutual interrogation can deepen understanding of these inequalities and ways to approach them in education praxis.#FRE#
