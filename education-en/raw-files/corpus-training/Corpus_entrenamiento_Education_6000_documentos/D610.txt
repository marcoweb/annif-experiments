#ITI#Invisible Funds of Identity in Urban Contexts#FTI#
#IRE# Diversity in cultures, languages and identities is a valuable resource in urban education. There is empirical evidence to support this assertion in the existing literature on funds of knowledge and funds of identity. However, the main focus of such research is on the tacit knowledge, skills, and resources that students—and their families—are explicitly aware of. The aim of this paper is to introduce the concept of invisible funds of identity with which we hope to account for those hegemonic societal discourses and practices that may be so internalized that it may not occur to individuals to mention them.#FRE#
