#ITI#Teaching Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Outside of the Classroom: An Autoethnographic Account of a Black Male Faculty in Residence#FTI#
#IRE#Research suggests there are numerous benefits gleaned from faculty interacting with students outside of the classroom. However, there is far less research on faculty-in-residence (FIR) experiences in general and Black FIRs in particular. Furthermore, there is no research that examines how FIRs promote institutional diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The purpose of this study was to explore how a tenure track Black male FIR spent nine months contributing to the residential education of students while advancing institutional diversity, equity, and inclusion aims. Three themes emerged from this inquiry and implications for practice and future research are offere#FRE#
