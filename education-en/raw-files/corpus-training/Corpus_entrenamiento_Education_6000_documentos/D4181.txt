#ITI#Oral defence as a feedback mechanism in doctoral development and examination#FTI#
#IRE#Oral defence is recognised as an important part of doctoral examination and candidate development. Unlike the UK and New Zealand, the Australian examination process does not normally include an end-of-process viva. This paper appraises the views of 20 supervisors and 13 Deans or Directors of Graduate Research from 11 Australian universities as they contemplate the advantages and disadvantages of adding an oral defence component to the Australian process. The majority preferred a ‘pre-completion seminar’ prior to thesis submission, rather than a viva after thesis submission. Such a seminar is believed to offer the candidate greater opportunity to reflect on their findings and integrate feedback into the final product. The findings are discussed in light of formative assessment and learner agency#FRE#
