#ITI#Interweaving disentangled: Korean American students with autism go to college#FTI#
#IRE# This study explores the intersectionality in the educational experiences of Korean American students with autism as they navigate the transition from high school to college. For these students, dis/ability status alone does not shape the pathway to adulthood: dis/ability is tightly bound with other social categories, such as race, language, and immigration status, impacting everyday experiences of the students, including preparing college applications, deciding where to apply, and then selecting a major or course of study. Using intersectionality theory, we disentangled the intersections of multiple sites of marginalization and interwove the social dynamics of transition trajectories. We also discuss these findings in the context of transition services and suggest directions for future research#FRE#
