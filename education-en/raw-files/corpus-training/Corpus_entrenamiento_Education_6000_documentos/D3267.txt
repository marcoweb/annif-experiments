#ITI#Innovative Learning Spaces of Higher Education: a Systematic Mapping Review of Themes#FTI#
#IRE#Current educational research and practice urge the reconceptualization of learning spaces' design, development, and usage. However, only some research studies address the formation of innovative learning spaces in higher education. This systematic mapping review (Grant & Booth. Health Information & Libraries Journal, 26, 91-108, 2009) focuses on identifying research trends and themes around innovative learning spaces in higher education and defining the innovative learning space as a concept. The analysis of 58 selected articles provides an overview of current literature with the identification of four themes such as 1) the design of the innovative learning spaces, 2) pedagogies employed in the innovative learning spaces, 3) students’ experiences in the innovative learning spaces, and 4) change management approaches towards the campus innovative learning space. The types of learning spaces influenced by the trends in pedagogy (towards constructivist approaches, such as active learning spaces) and technology (towards less physicality, such as hybrid learning spaces) are explored in this study. The analysis finalizes the challenges and recommendations for innovative learning space integration into campus teaching and learning experiences. It sets a foundation for further thematic analysis of innovative learning spaces literature#FRE#
