#ITI#Geometrical Figure Apprehension, Construction of Auxiliary Lines, and Multiple Solutions in Problem Solving: Aspects of Mathematical Creativity in School Geometry#FTI#
#IRE#The present study aims to examine mathematical creativity in students’ work in geometry. Research conducted was based on two aspects: (a) examining the influence of geometrical figure apprehension on the production of multiple solutions and (b) how the necessity to construct auxiliary lines in the given shape promotes the production of multiple solutions and the variables of creativity. Data was collected from 243 tenth graders (15 and 16 years old); all participants were asked to complete a 2-part test, a multiple solution problem solving test, and a geometrical figure apprehension test. The analysis of the results primarily shows that the way through which students perceive the geometrical figure and their ability to process it, is an important factor in predicting their mathematical creativity. Furthermore, it became evident that only perceptual apprehension of geometrical figures is not a reliable predictor of creativity variables, as opposed to operative apprehension of geometrical figures that positively predict the characteristics of creativity: fluency, flexibility, and originality#FRE#
