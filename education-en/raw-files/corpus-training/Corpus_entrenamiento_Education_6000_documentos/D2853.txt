#ITI#Bayesian meta-analysis using SAS PROC BGLIMM#FTI#
#IRE# Meta-analysis is commonly used to compare two treatments. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a powerful extension for comparing and contrasting multiple treatments simultaneously in a systematic review of multiple clinical trials. Although the practical utility of meta-analysis is apparent, it is not always straightforward to implement, especially for those interested in a Bayesian approach. This paper demonstrates that the recently-developed SAS procedure BGLIMM provides an intuitive and computationally efficient means for conducting Bayesian meta-analysis in SAS, using a worked example of a smoking cessation NMA data set. BGLIMM gives practitioners an effective and simple way to implement Bayesian meta-analysis (pairwise and network, either contrast-based or arm-based) without requiring significant background in coding or statistical modeling. Those familiar with generalized linear mixed models, and especially the SAS procedure GLIMMIX, will find this tutorial a useful introduction to Bayesian meta-analysis in SAS#FRE#
