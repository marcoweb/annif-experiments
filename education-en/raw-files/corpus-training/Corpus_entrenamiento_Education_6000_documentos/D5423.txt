#ITI#Drama-Based Activities for STEM Education: Encouraging Scientific Aspirations and Debunking Stereotypes in Secondary School Students in Spain and the UK#FTI#
#IRE#This study presents findings from testing an innovative student-centred drama-based teaching methodology for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines for secondary school students. The method, based on performances, was tested in two case studies, Spain and the UK, on a sample of 2089 students. These performances have been shown to be an effective way of generating a two-way dialogue between students and researchers and prompting student reflections about researchers as role models, gender inequalities in science and ethical issues in STEM careers and scientific research. Furthermore, they have enhanced young people’s positive attitudes and interest in science, scientists and scientific careers and have debunked science-related stereotypes. This indicates that the performances evaluated in this study are supporting the aspirations of young people, but not limiting their inclination to critically assess the relative benefits and risks of scientific development for themselves#FRE#
