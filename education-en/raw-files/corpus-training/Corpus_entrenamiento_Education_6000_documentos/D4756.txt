#ITI#PhD by LMS: Using a learning management system to facilitate self-directed learning in a doctoral study#FTI#
#IRE#Doctoral studies can be daunting unless candidates are able to implement effective self-directed strategies and motivational tools to ensure success, which is reflected in the high attrition rates of doctoral candidates globally. This paper explores the use of a learning management system (LMS) to support the completion of a PhD for a doctoral candidate in a regional university enrolled in the online offering. The LMS was used throughout the PhD journey by the candidate to manage and organise documents related to the PhD study and reflect on progress. Using a digital ethnographic methodology, we analyse artefacts from the LMS through the lens of self-directed learning including cognitive, metacognitive, affective and social strategies. Findings showed that the LMS proved to be a useful way to organise, access and store information and had tools to enable motivation, both by the doctoral candidate and the supervisor. They also showed that the relationship between the candidate and supervisor was critical in this success. Implications from this digital ethnography highlight important self-directed strategies enabled through the use of the LMS. In addition, the LMS allowed deep reflection on PhD progress and provided the necessary motivation to complete the study. Therefore, LMS use could potentially increase doctoral candidate retention.Implications for practice or policy • Supervisors within universities could consider facilitating an LMS as an effective learning environment to organise, access and store information for a doctoral student’s studies. • Doctoral students may benefit from the pedagogical tools in an LMS to enhance self-directed study and facilitate communication with supervisors during their doctoral studies. © (2023), (Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)).
