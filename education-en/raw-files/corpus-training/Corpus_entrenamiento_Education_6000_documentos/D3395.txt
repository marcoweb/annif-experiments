#ITI#Experiments in being global: the cosmopolitan nationalism of international schooling in China#FTI#
#IRE#This research applies the analytical lens of ‘cosmopolitan nationalism’ to examine how ‘non-traditional’ international high schools interweave cosmopolitan and nationalistic tendencies in Shenzhen, China. In-depth interviews with parents (n = 16) and students (n = 60) explored the motivations for choosing international schooling, experiences of international schooling, whether cosmopolitan identities are emerging amongst students and, if so, with what characteristics. The findings demonstrate the utility of ‘cosmopolitan nationalism’ in illuminating the nature of international schooling in China and extends it by applying it to denote the identities expressed by students, who confidently project the national into the global with their expectations for the future#FRE#
