#ITI#How do digital textbook platforms promote active learning in undergraduate biology courses?#FTI#
#IRE# Discipline-based educational researchers and institutions that provide guidance on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics instruction have long documented the impact of active learning strategies on student learning and achievement, the lack of incorporation of active learning into undergraduate instruction, and the languishing rates of progression through and completion of undergraduate degree programs. Most research on improving active learning has been found to focus on instructors and the ways they have promoted active learning in their course design. Our aim was to consider the ways that textbook publishers and the online learning platforms they have produced have provided resources to promote active learning. This content analysis has documented the degree to which the digital platform companions to four highly subscribed introductory biology textbooks have provided resources that promote (1) highlighting of informational texts, (2) self-testing, and (3) generative strategies for learning, including self-explanation, summarization, and elaboration. Digital platforms largely supported highlighting and self-testing, but the features of these tools could have been improved to promote more productive engagement in the learning strategies and to provide more explicit instruction about and scaffolding of the practices. Resources that promoted additional generative strategies were more limited. Implications relevant to developers and instructors who wish to leverage digital resources to promote active learning are included and are grounded via empirical support of design and implementation choices#FRE#
