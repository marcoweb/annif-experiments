#ITI#The challenge for university teaching and research practice in Zimbabwe: an empirical study#FTI#
#IRE#The article examines challenges faced by academics in Zimbabwe's universities. With a particular focus on university teaching and research, the article draws upon empirical evidence from a survey study and in-depth semi-structured interviews with academics from four public universities. The survey findings suggest that years of university teaching experience, area of specialisation, professional title, and education levels are not strong determinants on the academics’ view towards political instability as one of the main issues impacting their work. The qualitative interview data provide further evidence on how all the different academics consider political instability as a factor negatively impacting university teaching and research. The most significant finding is that academics blame government policies. The article identifies the variegated market-oriented policies adopted in the university as the cause of the challenges and consequently calls for an interrogation of the policy from Zimbabwean academics and all other concerned stakeholders in higher education#FRE#
