#ITI#Instructional clarity and classroom management are linked to attitudes towards mathematics: A combination of student and teacher ratings#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Previous research examined the relationship between teaching characteristics and constructs of attitudes towards mathematics (ATM) from the student perspective in isolation. Aims: This study aims to survey the relationship between instructional clarity and classroom management and ATM constructs (i.e., mathematics self-concept, mathematics value, enjoyment and boredom) from the student and teacher perspectives. Samples: The data was gathered from 8698 eighth graders (49.9% girls) and 536 math instructors (70% female) who participated in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2019 survey in the United States. Students were nested within 537 classrooms in 273 schools. Methods: The multilevel modelling was used to explore the link between instructional clarity and classroom management and ATM constructs. Results: Instructional clarity and classroom management represented different constructs at the student and class level when combining student and teacher perspectives. Students' reports of the two teaching characteristics revealed significant connections with ATM constructs, particularly with regard to instructional clarity. Whereas, teachers' reports of instructional clarity had no relationships with aspects of ATM. Furthermore, compared with students' ratings, classroom management rated by teachers showed a greater relation with ATM constructs except for boredom. Conclusions: Combining multilevel analyses with student and teacher evaluations of classroom teaching is a promising endeavour. Students' perceptions of instructional clarity play an influential role in ATM outcomes, while teacher-rated classroom management is of great relevance to ATM constructs (except boredom) than students' reports#FRE#
