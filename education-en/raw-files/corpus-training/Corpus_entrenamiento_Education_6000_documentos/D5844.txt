#IRE#Do preparation and perceived support from guardians and teachers influence student attendance to a residential environmental education (EE) field trip program? To explore this question, pre-visit surveys were administered to racially diverse sixth-grade students at seven schools invited to attend a residential EE program at no cost, namely NorthBay Education in North East, Maryland, USA. Results indicate that while desire to attend the residential camp did not differ by students’ racial identity, Black and Latinx students were less likely to attend the program. Guardian support to attend and logistical preparation were each positively related to student attendance, irrespective of racial group, with Latinx students reporting the lowest levels of guardian support to attend. Black student attendance was also correlated with geographic and psychological preparation. Tailoring pre-trip preparation and engagement to address the unique needs of each schools’ student body is likely needed to promote student attendance. However, these results indicate that inequities in program attendance persist across racial groups and further investigation into program conception, design, communication, and execution is needed to understand and address this concern#FRE#
