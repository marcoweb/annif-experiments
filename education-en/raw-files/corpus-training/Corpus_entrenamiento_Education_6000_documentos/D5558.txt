#ITI#Codesigning learning environments guided by the framework of Universal Design for Learning: a case study#FTI#
#IRE#Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is defined as a scientifically-valid instructional framework for guiding the design of learning environments that support all students. The implementation of UDL often requires proactive considerations of learner variability and iterative instructional designs that meet emergent student needs in a learning environment. This article focuses on a case study with a concurrent mixed-methods design that explored how a codesign process involving researchers, an educator, and students evolved to facilitate the implementation of UDL in an elementary classroom. An elementary educator and 25 students participated in the study. Quantitative and qualitative data collected from observations, interviews, and repeated measurements of student engagement were analyzed to track changes in the educator’s instructional designs, attitudes toward UDL implementation, and student engagement. We identified an improvement in the educator’s UDL-aligned instructional practices and positive attitudes toward using student perception data to inform instructional improvement through the codesign process. Opportunities and challenges with respect to the UDL implementation were discussed#FRE#
