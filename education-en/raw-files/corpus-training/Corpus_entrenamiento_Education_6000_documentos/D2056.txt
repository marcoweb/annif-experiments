#ITI#Social classification and the changing boundaries of learning. A neopragmatic perspective on social sorting in digital education#FTI#
#IRE# Allowing learners to move across learning contexts in novel ways, digital tools play an increasingly central role for the formation of learning trajectories and identities. They thus presumably also affect dynamics of social sorting in education. Against this background, this article introduces a conceptual framework for unravelling dynamics of social sorting in digital learning environments. Inspired by French pragmatic sociology, we propose classification as analytical anchor point for disentangling the intricate interplays between educational technologies, learning situations, and wider moral and social orders. We present a ‘speculative inquiry’ into current AIED to demonstrate the added value this analytical perspective. We identify a hiatus between ‘inspired’ and ‘industrial’ logics of classification in current digital learning tools and environments that are likely to yield unwanted social sorting effects. A classification lens helps foreground social dynamics underlying such patterns, thus furthering our understanding of persistent patterns of disadvantaging in (digital) education#FRE#
