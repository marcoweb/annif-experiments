#ITI#Personality traits predict the effects of Internet and academic self-efficacy on practical performance anxiety in online learning under the COVID-19 lockdown#FTI#
#IRE# Due to COVID-19, the primary teaching method has changed from traditional face-to-face teaching to online teaching. The present study explored the correlates between two personality traits, Neuroticism and Extraversion, and two types of self-efficacy, Internet self-efficacy and academic self-efficacy, on practical performance anxiety. Data from 273 technical college students were collected. Structural equation modeling analysis was performed. Results show that Neuroticism and Extraversion can predict students’ practical performance anxiety through Internet and academic self-efficacy. Moreover, Neuroticism can negatively predict Internet and academic self-efficacy. Extraversion can positively predict Internet and academic self-efficacy. The two types of self-efficacy can positively predict practical performance anxiety. According to the results, it seems necessary to reduce students’ practical performance anxiety by paying attention to their personality features and their self-efficacy#FRE#
