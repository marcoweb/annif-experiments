#ITI#Indifferent, (Un)critical, and anti-intellectual: framing how teachers grapple with bans on teaching truth about race and racism, and critical race theory#FTI#
#IRE# Current conservative assaults on Critical Race Theory (CRT) in education contend that elementary and secondary teachers and teacher education faculty are not only ‘teaching CRT’, but also hatred of white people and of ‘America’. This article is based on a study that used CRT analytical tools and narrative inquiry to examine pre- and in-service teachers’ understanding of CRT bans, race, and racism. Through individual and focus group interviews with racially and ethnically diverse pre- and in-service teachers, manifestations of anti-intellectualism and (dis)ease emerged in participant responses to questions about their perceptions of, and evidence-based knowledge about, CRT, as well as race and racism. Implications call for a radical rethinking of teacher preparation by helping teachers develop epistemic humility, curiosity, and courage#FRE#
