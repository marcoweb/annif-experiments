#ITI#Development of a Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Policy for Canadian Childcare Settings: A Delphi Study#FTI#
#IRE#This study aimed to obtain consensus on physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) policy items for use in Canadian childcare settings. Purposeful sampling of Canadian experts in PA/SB (n = 19) and Early Childhood Education (ECE; n = 20) was used to form two distinct (i.e., PA/SB and ECE) panels for a 3-round Delphi study. In round 1, the PA/SB experts suggested their top 10 items for a Canadian childcare PA/SB policy. Policy items were then pooled to generate a list of 24 unique items. In round 2, experts in both panels rated the importance of the 24 policy items using a 7-point Likert scale (i.e., 1 = Not at all important to 7 = Extremely important). The ECE panel was also asked to report on the feasibility of the policy items using a 4-point Likert scale (i.e., 1 = Not at all feasible to 4 = Very feasible). Policy items that received an interquartile deviation (IQD) score of ≤ 1 (indicating consensus) and a median score of ≥ 6 (indicating importance) in both panels were considered shared priorities. In round 3, members of both panels re-rated the importance of the policy items that did not achieve consensus among their respective panel in round 2 and were asked to order items based on importance. Descriptive statistics were used to assess feasibility of policy items, and differences in panel ratings were quantified using Mann Whitney U tests. Consensus was achieved for 23 policy items in the PA/SB panel and 17 items in the ECE panel. Overall, 15 shared priorities were identified (e.g., provide 120 min of outdoor time per day, sedentary behaviour should not be used as a punishment), and six policy items exhibited a statistical difference in ratings across panels. Members of the ECE panel indicated that the policy item, “children should be permitted to go outside whenever they want, for as long as they want” (M = 1.78; SD = 0.65) was lowest in terms of feasibility, and the policy item, “children should receive opportunities to engage in both unstructured and structured physical activity opportunities daily” (M = 3.89; SD = 0.32) was the most feasible for daily implementation. Findings from this study can inform the development of an expert-generated and feasibility-informed institutional PA/SB policy for use in Canadian childcare settings. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
