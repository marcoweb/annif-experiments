#ITI#Learning in Dialogue with Latinx Children of Immigrants: Reflections on the Co-emergence of Collaborative Linguistic Inquiry and Critical Pedagogical Praxis#FTI#
#IRE# In this article, we recount our experiences learning from and with Latinx children of immigrants in urban schools. Highlighting how insights gleaned from our respective ethnographic projects have led us to embrace more explicit commitments to participatory engagement, we consider how young people's perspectives can and should fundamentally shift adults’ understanding of their communicative practices and linguistic ingenuity. We end by articulating a utopian vision for educational ethnography and language education in urban schools, one characterized by multidirectional and intergenerational learning, and in which critical pedagogical praxis emerges as researchers and teachers engage in dialogue with Latinx children of immigrants.#FRE#
