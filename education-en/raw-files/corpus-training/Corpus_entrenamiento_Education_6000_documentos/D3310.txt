#ITI#Adapting to the Future: ChatGPT as a Means for Supporting Constructivist Learning Environments#FTI#
#IRE#ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) language model, holds significant promise for improving the quality and efficiency of teaching and learning. However, its potential challenges and disruptions in education systems require further investigation for a deeper understanding and mitigation. Given that ChatGPT is already being utilized and complete prohibition is unlikely, it becomes crucial to consider how educators can harness its potential to enhance teaching and learning experiences, assuming successful implementation. This article explores the potential benefits and disruptions within the current education system, and proposes strategies for integrating ChatGPT into educational settings from a constructivist learning perspective. It focuses on four educational system attributes: context, collaboration, conversation, and construction. The article particularly emphasizes the utilization of ChatGPT as a means, rather than an end, to enhance student learning within a constructivist learning environment. This approach aims to address present concerns and challenges effectively#FRE#
