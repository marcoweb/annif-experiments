#ITI#Praxis of the undercommons: rupturing university conviviality and coded formations of diversity#FTI#
#IRE#The concept of the undercommons offers a lens for complicating the discourse of conviviality in education. In this paper, the authors draw on learning experiences opened through black feminisms, decoloniality and anti-coloniality, and new materialisms in an experimental graduate course. Presenting stories drawn from a shared educational space, they theorise fugitive convivial praxis and elucidate insurgent opportunities for intellectual study that nurture decolonial undercurrents of the university apparatus. Such engagements allowed for radical vulnerability in coming together through processes of ethical care, place-making, and counter-expressive thinking especially when coded formations of diversity insist on colonial logics and modes of operation in higher education. With curiosities and questions emerging in the undercommons, the authors also consider remote learning during the coronavirus pandemic toward future possibilities#FRE#
