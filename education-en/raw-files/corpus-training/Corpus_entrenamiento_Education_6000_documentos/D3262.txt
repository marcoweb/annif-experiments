#ITI#Inside the Garbage Can: Theory of Organizational Anarchy and Considerations for Instructional Designers#FTI#
#IRE#In organizational anarchies (i.e., public institutions) decisions are typically made by oversight or flight. Decision makers and choice opportunities exist simultaneously but on separate tracks resulting in few problems being solved. This paper presents the findings of a study surveying current literature on organizational anarchy as well as studies that have reported on how decision styles, problem activity, problem latency, decision-maker activity, and decision difficulty impact instructional design decision-making#FRE#
