#ITI#Using Sequence Analysis to Determine the Well-Functioning of Small Groups in Large Online Courses#FTI#
#IRE# Collaborative learning in small groups can enrich and enhance the learning experience in large online courses by facilitating interaction and collaborative knowledge building between peers. on the work reported here addresses scenarios based on asynchronous communication and exchange. As compared to synchronous and face-to-face settings, these scenarios require higher explicit coordination efforts and specific support mechanisms to reach out to inactive group members. This can be achieved by human tutors as well as through automatic interventions by the system in the organization and facilitation of group work. Our approach is based on characterizing the quality or well-functioning of collaboration using sequence alignment techniques that were originally developed in bioinformatics for the comparison of DNA sequences. Sequence alignment provides a similarity measure between pairs of action logs originating from the group work. The ensuing similarity matrix allows for clustering the working groups characterized by the similarity of their complete action logs. Notably, these clusters differ clearly in terms of quality measures related to the activity distribution and group output. This allows for determining quality indicators that can trigger feedback and adaptive scaffolding. Our data stem from inter-university online courses in which regular (weekly or bi-weekly) assignments had to be completed in small groups supported by an online forum for coordination and a separate tool for the actual collaborative writing. The basic actions are interpreted/coded as different contribution types, namely coordination, monitoring, minor/major contributions. Longer periods of inactivity are coded as another type of action (“gap”). These are the building blocks for the sequence alignment. One consequence of our analysis is a revision of the intuitive assumption that inactivity is a main indicator of inefficient group work: We found that inactivity can be compensated by early coordination to the extent that coordination is even the most important factor for successful group work. These insights are now being used to design alert mechanisms to signal inefficient group work and to generate timely interventions#FRE#
