#ITI#Visualization Type and Frequency in Final Year High School Science Examinations#FTI#
#IRE#The significance of the role of students’ interpretation and creation of multiple forms ofrepresentation in science learning has long been established and advocated, but there is apaucity of research into the extent to which this emphasis in science education is reflected inhigh stakes final year high school science examinations. This study investigated the inclusionof visualizations in the questions within such examinations that require students to construct aresponse, and also the extent to which such questions required students to create or modifydiagrams or graphs within their responses. Examinations in physics, biology and chemistryfrom the Cambridge International Examination, New Zealand, Singapore and the States ofNew South Wales and Victoria in Australia over a six-year period (2014-2019) wereanalysed. The results indicate that less than one third of constructed response item (CRI)questions include visualisations, with most occurring in physics, then biology and thenchemistry. An infinitesimally small percentage of questions across all subjects and in all butone of the jurisdictions required the creation or augmentation of visualisations. Themisalignment between the integral role of visualizations in science pedagogy and the paucityof visualizations in CRIs in final year high school examinations as well as implications forexamination re-design and associated further research are discussed#FRE#
