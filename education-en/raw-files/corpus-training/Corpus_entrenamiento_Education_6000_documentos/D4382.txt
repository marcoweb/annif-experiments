#ITI#Characteristics of social support experienced by differently engaged student teachers#FTI#
#IRE#This study explored student teachers’ experiences of study engagement and burnout by utilising profile analysis. Interrelations between the student teachers’ profiles and perceptions of their learning environment were also explored. To complement the statistical analysis, the student teachers’ social support experiences during teaching practice were explored based on interview data. Two study engagement—burnout profiles were detected among student teachers. The student teachers exhibiting the engaged in studies with a low risk of burnout profile had significantly more positive perceptions of their learning environments compared with the group classified under the reduced study engagement with an increased risk of burnout profile. Further investigation showed that student teachers most frequently reported informational support received from their teaching practice supervisors. The groups representing the two profiles showed both similar and different characteristics in the types and sources of social support. The study contributes to the understanding of student teachers’ study engagement in relation to the learning environment of teacher education. It provides practical implications for teacher educators to improve the learning environments of differently engaged student teachers, particularly during teaching practice, a central arena for student teacher learning#FRE#
