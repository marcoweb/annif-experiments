#ITI#Revisiting radical diversality: a philosophy of inclusion premised on the selective rejection of origins#FTI#
#IRE#This article addresses the political philosophy of a border position articulated by de Oliveira Andreotti (2011. “(Towards) Decoloniality and Diversality in Global Citizenship Education.” Globalisation, Societies and Education 9 (3–4): 381–397) with reference to the Latin American Modernity/Coloniality Research Group. This border epistemology will be discussed in the context of the claims of radical diversality as necessary in decolonial thinking and political theory. The article consists of a first half which considers the question of a centre and the problems associated with borders in comparison with Fanon (2004. The Wretched of the Earth. New York: Grove Press, 2008. Black Skin, White Masks. New York: Grove Press). The second half consists of an analysis of narrative responses from a grad seminar on decolonising methodologies which considered de Oliveira Andreotti’s (2011. “(Towards) Decoloniality and Diversality in Global Citizenship Education.” Globalisation, Societies and Education 9 (3–4): 381–397) work in the Winter Term of 2018#FRE#
