#ITI#The role of recognition in disciplinary identity for girls#FTI#
#IRE# Computing fields are foundational to most STEM disciplines and the only STEM discipline to show a consistent decline in women's representation since 1990, making it an important field for STEM educators to study. The explanation for the underrepresentation of women and girls in computing is twofold: a sense that they do not fit within the stereotypes associated with computing and a lack of access to computer games and technologies beginning at an early age (Richard, 2016). Informal coding education programs are uniquely situated to counter these hurdles because they can offer additional resources and time for engagement in specially designed activities developed around best practices to improve girls coding identities (National Research Council [NRC], 2009). We draw upon research by Calabrese Barton et al. (2013) and Carlone and Johnson's (2007) research as a lens by which to examine girls' coding identity work in an informal coding education setting—a concept not currently defined in the science education research literature. In this paper, we describe the coding identity trajectories of three middle school girls who participated in a coding camp: Lilly, Victoria, and Beth. Our results provide a conceptual framework that will guide future research on coding identity that better encompasses the role of recognition by educators and peers on youth's coding identity development. This framework can be used to guide broader science education identity research, particularly as it applies to informal STEM education settings that work to engage students, especially girls, across the STEM spectrum#FRE#
