#ITI#Doctoral intelligence: a framework for developing mindsets for doctorateness in changing doctoral contexts#FTI#
#IRE# Shifting doctoral contexts disrupt conventional doctoral educational practice. A research development framework is thus necessary; one that can advance quality research but also enhance skills for social impact beyond the qualification. The doctoral intelligence framework has been conceptualised to provide a map of the doctoral terrain and represents the knowing, doing, thinking and willing mindsets or mental tools necessary for success. The article reports on a study to enrich this research development framework through an empirical exploration among a sample of 22 mainly part-time PhD students and graduates. The aim of the study was to identify mindsets for developing doctorateness. The findings extend insights into the four key mindsets related to scholars’ cognition regarding the process and product of the PhD (knowing), self-management for ownership when stuck (doing), the process that extends various thinking mindsets, and the willing mindset for sustaining momentum during the doctorate. This enriched perspective of the doctoral intelligence framework will guide educators regarding pedagogical realignment for the modern context to enhance the quality of research and also better develop the knowledge makers of the future#FRE#
