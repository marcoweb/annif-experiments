#ITI#School functioning and experience of the school environment by students with ADHD#FTI#
#IRE#An increasing number of recent studies in the field of special needs education have recognised the importance of factors supporting school preparation and inclusion of students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Recent studies have also highlighted the need for further detailed investigation of the lived school experience in clinical samples of ADHD students. Therefore, the goal of this qualitative study was to explore the factors that ADHD students perceived as supportive for their school functioning. The sample consisted of 20 students with ADHD from the Czech Republic, aged 12 to 14 years. Thematic analysis of the interviews with ADHD students revealed the following supportive factors for effective functioning and inclusion of ADHD students at school: parenting style respecting the special needs of ADHD students, close friendship of ADHD students with their peers, openness and warmth of the teachers, practical teachers’ and parents’ interventions tailored to the strengths of ADHD students and ADHD students’ own effort to manage ADHD manifestations at school. Based on these findings, several practical recommendations and implications are formulated#FRE#
