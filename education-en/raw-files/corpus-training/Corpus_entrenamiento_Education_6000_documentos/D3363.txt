#ITI#Blending ahead: the advantages of young people of mixed origin in Portuguese compulsory schooling#FTI#
#IRE#Young people of mixed origin are gaining greater recognition in migration and integration studies. Increasing rates of intermarriage are leading to the growth of mixed populations, namely in educational settings. In this paper we discuss the social conditions and school experiences of students of mixed native-immigrant families in Portugal, comparing them with those of their peers. The analysis is based on a survey involving 1,194 9th-grade students. The results have revealed that mixed origin students outperform their peers in terms of average classifications and top grades, showing more positive conditions and experiences than either native students or those with migrant backgrounds. Results recommend taking a more cautious approach when mixing these youngsters into the broad category of children of immigrants#FRE#
