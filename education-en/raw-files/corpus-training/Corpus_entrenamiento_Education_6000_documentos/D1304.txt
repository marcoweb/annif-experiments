#ITI#Group regulation guidance through agile learning strategies: empowering co-regulation, transactive memory, group cohesion, atmosphere, and participation#FTI#
#IRE# The main purpose of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is to improve academic performance through collaborative systems design. To increase the quantity and quality of interactions in CSCL and to reduce feelings of loneliness and burnout during online learning, learner group regulation should be supported. According to the literature, performance and learning motivation cannot be achieved if group communication and interactions are not adequately supported in collaborative learning. However, studies comparing traditional online teamwork and co-regulation guidance are rare. In this context, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of experimental application designed using agile project management tools to support students’ group regulation in collaborative teamwork in online environments on co-regulation, transactive memory, group cohesion, atmosphere, and participation in web programming education. 91 university students participated in this study, which was carried out in the web programming course. The application lasted 17 weeks. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected in the study, which was designed with the mixed method. As a result of the research, there was a significant difference between the co-regulation, group cohesion, and group participation scores of the students in group regulation guidance practices through agile learning strategies, according to the intervention groups. It was concluded that the experimental application had positive effects on the improvement of group dynamics. This study provides an example of how to develop co-regulation practices in online collaborative contexts#FRE#
