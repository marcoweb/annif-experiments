#ITI#An evaluation of the impact of flipped-classroom teaching on mathematics proficiency and self-efficacy in Saudi Arabia#FTI#
#IRE# The flipped classroom (FC) is becoming an increasingly popular teaching method in mathematics education. However, few studies have rigorously evaluated its effectiveness, and less so in countries where students' level of mathematics achievement is low. In this study, we evaluated the impact of an FC intervention in Saudi Arabia, the country with the lowest level of maths achievement in the last iteration of the Trends International Mathematics and Science Study TIMSS. A total of 281 secondary school students received eight weeks of algebra training using either FC or traditional instruction, and were tested on algebra problems taken from past national standardised tests, as well as on a measure of self-efficacy. Students who received the intervention showed higher self-efficacy but no significant difference in maths achievement was observed. Students' and teachers' perceptions of the intervention were positive. Practitioner notes: What is already known about this topic The flipped classroom is an increasingly popular teaching method in mathematics education. There is evidence that the method is beneficial for students. However, there have been very few rigorous evaluation studies of flipped classrooms and most were conducted in the US, Taiwan and China. Whether the beneficial impact of flipped classrooms can be generalised to other countries, particularly countries with low proficiency in mathematics, remains unclear. What this paper adds We evaluated the impact of the flipped classroom in Saudi Arabia, a country with low proficiency in mathematics and limited technological resources. We used a rigorous design (with a control group) and educationally relevant outcome measures. We found that a flipped classroom can have a positive impact on students' self-efficacy, and that the method was perceived positively by both teachers and students. Based on interview data, we also documented the perceptions and concerns of the participating teachers. Implications for practice and/or policy Flipped classrooms showed promising results in a context which differs markedly from previous evaluations, suggesting that the method can be beneficial in a range of contexts. This positive impact was observed despite the intervention being relatively short (six weeks) and implemented by teachers previously unfamiliar with the flipped classroom method#FRE#
