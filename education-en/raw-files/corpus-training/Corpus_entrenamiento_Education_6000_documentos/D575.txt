#ITI#Introducing Curricular and Pedagogical Resuscitation (CPR): A Black Approach to Reviving the Self and Collective through Social Studies#FTI#
#IRE# Social studies has been lagging in the race to gain classroom instructional time due to the impact of high-stakes testing in urban schools. Furthermore, social studies can be particularly uninteresting to Black students whose diverse sociocultural histories and perspectives remain diminished or absent. Therefore, this paper advances curricular and pedagogical resuscitation (CPR) as a renewed and continuing quest to properly address and privilege Black students and their lived experiences. Employing BlackCrit, we forward CPR as a more accurate, timely, and holistic social studies approach—addressing the body, spirit, and mind of our students.#FRE#
