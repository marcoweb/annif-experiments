#ITI#Authentic learning using mobile applications and contemporary geospatial information requirements related to Environmental Science#FTI#
#IRE#In this paper, we examine the potential of authentic learning activities and assessment to enhance the student learning experience in a standalone introductory geospatial information science module. Computer laboratory sessions form seventy-five percent of contact hours and final grade, so authentic learning used a field-based project with specified features, study area and aerial photo form the basis of assessment. The class collects all relevant geospatial information using mobile devices. Students present personally collected, and class-merged geospatial information as workplace style reports in scaffolded assessments. All submitted data are collected by the class and managed by the students. Essential skills and employment opportunities using GIS skills form the basis of authenticity of this module and guide student expectations. We evaluate outcomes through a two-year case study examining design, implementation and revision of the Unit, by using a mixed-methods approach including multiple, staged student surveys, focus groups, and student results. A focus on authenticity increased student appreciation of employability in GIS-related positions, and students reported increased motivation to learn#FRE#
