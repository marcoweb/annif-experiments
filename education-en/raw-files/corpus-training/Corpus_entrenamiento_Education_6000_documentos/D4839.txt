#ITI#An Exploration of the Psychometric Properties of the Social Experiences Questionnaire: Replication and Extension#FTI#
#IRE#Peer victimization is critical to study in early and middle childhood as it is associated with adjustment and behavioral problems in adolescence. Because much victimization occurs outside of the purview of adults, self-report measures are important assessments of this construct; however, there is limited evidence for the psychometric properties of the score interpretations of many measures. The goal of the current study was to replicate and extend previous work with the Social Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ; Crick and Grotpeter, Development and Psychopathology 8:367–380, 1996). Specifically, we explored the factor structure of the measure, investigated measurement invariance across gender, age and time, and examined evidence for criterion-related validity of the SEQ score interpretations. Participants were 558 children (49.2% girls; 50.7% boys) within the classrooms of 34 teachers (Kindergarten—5th grade). Children completed the SEQ, and children and teachers completed measures of social and academic functioning in the fall and spring of the school year. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed strong evidence for a two-factor solution (Factor 1: victimization; Factor 2: receipt of prosocial acts), with evidence of invariance across gender, age, and time. There was evidence of criterion-related validity across measures of social and academic functioning. Implications for our understanding of victimization and continued use of the SEQ are discussed#FRE#
