#ITI#Robot programming intervention for promoting spatial relations, mental rotation and visual memory of kindergarten children#FTI#
#IRE# The study’s purpose was to examine the contribution of a programmable robot to an intervention program for promoting spatial ability (spatial relations, visual-memory, mental rotation) of preschool children. Eighty-four participants were randomly assigned to three intervention groups: programmable-robot-based intervention, traditional intervention, control group. Spatial ability was examined pre- and post-10 intervention sessions. Findings indicate that the children exposed to the programmable-robot intervention displayed significantly higher spatial-relations and mental-rotation improvement compared with the traditional intervention and control group. However, the robot did not contribute to visual-memory. The study emphasizes the importance of finding innovative ways to promote spatial ability in young children#FRE#
