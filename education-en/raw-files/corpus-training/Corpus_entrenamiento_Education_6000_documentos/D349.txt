#ITI#Effects of a training course on creation of an empowering motivational climate in physical education: a quasi-experimental study#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Physical education (PE) teachers report needing additional support in terms of classroom climate and students’ motivation (Verret et al. [2017]. Enquête provinciale sur les pratiques inclusives en enseignement de l’éducation physique et à la santé: Rapport provincial primaire et secondaire. Montréal, Québec: Université du Québec à Montréal. https://inclusion-eps.uqam.ca/diffusion/). Professional development represents an opportunity to exchange on their practices with colleagues, become familiar with the latest research on effective motivational strategies, develop new skills and support transfer into practice. Objective: This study aims to determine if participation in a 2-day training course (spread over 3 days) on how to create an empowering motivational climate impacted students’ motivational variables (self-determined motivation, basic needs satisfaction, perception of motivational climate and PE effort as well as their intention to be physically active) and observed motivational climate. Research design: Quasi-experimental study Method: A total of 11 PE teachers (experimental group-EG = 6, control group-CG = 5) and their students (elementary = 107, secondary = 100) were recruited. Students completed questionnaires twice: once before the course and once after it was over. Teachers were filmed during two lessons: once before the start of training and once between the second and the last day of training, during a motivational strategy experiment planned by PE teachers on the second day of training. To analyze the data, we used non-parametric tests: the Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test for related samples. Two experts coded the videos (intrarater reliability = 90.6%; interrater reliability = 93.8%). Findings: Results indicate that the teachers’ training had no significant positive effect on students’ motivation. In fact, it was surprising to observe a significant decline in students’ perception of an empowering motivational climate and effort in the experimental group. However, scores were already quite high at the start of the year, remained high in the middle of the year and were similar for the two groups. Between both measurement points, the control group's amotivation increased and autonomy satisfaction decreased. This was not the case for students in the experimental group, suggesting that the training course might be effective in avoiding the detriment of students’ motivation. PE teachers in the experimental group were more empowering during the integration phase of the lesson. Gaps and the overall rating of the lesson (motivational climate) were both more empowering in the experimental group, but did not reach statistical significance (p =.066), which is promising for future interventions#FRE#
