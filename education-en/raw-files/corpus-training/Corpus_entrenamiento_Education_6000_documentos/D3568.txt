#ITI#Initiatives to facilitate the social inclusion of people with intellectual disability in physical activities with others in community-based sporting, recreation and leisure activities: A scoping review#FTI#
#IRE#Background: While barriers to participation in physical activity are well documented, there is no consolidated evidence on strategies promoting participation of people with intellectual disability in physical activities. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to examine initiatives used to facilitate the inclusion of people with intellectual disability in community-based sporting and recreation activities. We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL+ and PsycINFO for articles published in English between 2000 and 2022. Results: Eight articles were included. Initiatives included: (1) building knowledge, awareness and attitudinal change (2) organisational alliances/partnerships (3) relationship-building (4) modifications/adaptions to activities/environment (5) organisational policy (6) engagement with people with disability. Initiatives were implemented through international collaborations, in local fitness/recreational facilities and public spaces, and targeted athletes, coaches, volunteers and organisational leaders. Conclusion: While some increase in awareness and inclusion of people with intellectual disability was reported, no longitudinal data reported on the impact of initiatives on sustained social inclusion for people with intellectual disability#FRE#
