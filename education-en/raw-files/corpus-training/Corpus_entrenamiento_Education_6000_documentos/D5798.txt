#ITI#An investigation of environmental awareness and practice among a sample of undergraduate students in Belize#FTI#
#IRE#Climate change is causing rapid environmental deterioration in the Caribbean. Therefore, empowering citizens to become environmentally literate is crucial. This study examined environmental awareness (EA) and practice (EP) among a sample (n=207) of Belizean undergraduate students. An Environmental Knowledge Indicator (High = 18-20; Moderate = 14-17; Low = 10-13; Poor = 7-9; Very Poor= < 6) and an Environmentally Responsible Behaviour scale (High = 72-80; Moderate = 56-71; Low = 40-55; Poor = 26-39; Very Poor= < 25) were used to collect data. Results revealed low levels of environmental awareness (M=13.5), and poor environmentally responsible practice (M=33.4). There was no statistically significant relationship between EA and EP. Males had statistically higher EA scores (M =14.06) than females (M= 12.49), t (205) = 3.53, p =.001. They also had statistically higher EP scores (M=35.11) than females (M = 32.15), t (203) = 2.07, p<.05). Natural Science students had statistically higher EA scores (M = 13.93) than Social Science students (M= 12.41), t (205) = -3.51, p=.001. They also had statistically higher EP scores (M = 34.97) than Social Science students (M= 31.82), t (203) = -2.23, p<.05. These results may suggest inadequate exposure to Education for Sustainable Development models#FRE#
