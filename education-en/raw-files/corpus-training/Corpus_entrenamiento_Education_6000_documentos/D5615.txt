#ITI#Paraprofessional support in Irish schools: from special needs assistants to inclusion support assistants#FTI#
#IRE#Paraprofessional support to enable access to education has developed in differing directions in a range of countries. In Ireland, the role of the special needs assistant has focused on supporting the additional care needs of children with special educational needs to ensure their participation in lessons. The role of the special needs assistant (SNA) was considered crucial as Irish mainstream schools adapted to delivering more inclusive learning environments. Support provision has been recently reconceptualised and within this model special needs assistants are now designated as Inclusion Support Assistants with a very specific care role excluding any teaching activity. This research draws on data from a longitudinal study of SEN provision with a specific focus on the role of SNAs within Irish schools. Findings indicated that the contribution of special needs assistants was highly valued by education stakeholders. It is suggested that the evolution of the SNA role in Ireland can support schools in adopting a flexible approach to create inclusive learning environments#FRE#
