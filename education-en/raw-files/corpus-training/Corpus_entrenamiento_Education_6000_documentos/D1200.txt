#ITI#Whither employment protections? Deregulation and the flexibilisation of the teaching workforce in the state-funded sector#FTI#
#IRE# This paper looks at the flexibilisation of teachers’ employment relations in England in the context of an accelerated deregulation of work and employment conditions and of educational provision. It brings to light a contrasted picture, where external flexibilisation, through the recruitment of unqualified teachers, seems to be contained by a mixture of diverse but convergent interests and norms from the State, teacher unions and employers. Meanwhile, forms of internal flexibilisation (regarding working time, pay, and job boundaries and workplaces) appear to be more pervasive. This raises fundamental questions about the meaning of ‘standard’ employment relations in the teaching sector#FRE#
