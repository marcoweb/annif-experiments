#ITI#Using an industry-aligned capabilities framework to effectively assess student performance in non-accredited work-integrated learning contexts#FTI#
#IRE#This study recognises how Industry 4.0 is influencing labour market demands of graduating students and how ongoing discord between employers and educators regarding their preparation is driving work-integrated learning across the sector. Stakeholder involvement in capability development requires expected performance standards to benchmark students for learning and assessment purposes, especially in non-accredited contexts which lack defined standards of competency. Industry stakeholders were engaged to review, validate and extend an established capabilities framework to reflect mega-trends posed by contemporary work and to define dimensions of standardised assessment for the purpose of work-integrated learning. Findings highlighted the need for graduates that are digitally literate, resilient, adaptable, and able to collaborate and communicate with others from diverse backgrounds in virtual and face-to-face settings. The resultant framework provides specific, clear and measurable behaviours that reflect industry expectations of graduating students, translating to authentic assessment criteria for multi-stakeholder evaluation of student performance during work-integrated learning#FRE#
