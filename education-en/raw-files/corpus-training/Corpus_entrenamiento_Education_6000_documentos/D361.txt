#ITI#Emergence of physical literacy in physical education: some curricular repercussions#FTI#
#IRE# Background: The notion of carry-over value of certain physical activities has long been a preoccupation for physical education (PE) curriculum planners, one goal of PE being to prepare students for an active lifestyle in their adulthood. This goal is reinforced by the fact that over the last decade, there has been a considerable increase in interest for physical literacy (PL), a construct that advocates individuals’ lifetime involvement in and with physical activity. This trend is likely to bring about a good deal of adjustments in the curriculum and the delivery of teaching in PE. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to discuss the emergence of PL over the last years and examine how this trend can blend into the general objectives and the specifics of the PE curriculum, particularly with regard to older students (high school and college level). Scaffold of the paper: Following an analogy between literacy and PL, and an operational definition of PL and related philosophical foundations, the development of PL in school is presented as a learner/user-centered, situated, socio-constructivist, systemic and progressive process. Considering the part of the PL journey vested in PE, a resulting expansion of PE subject matter is envisioned, and the particular case of learners’ performance appreciation is examined. Finally, the author offers a critical analysis of the ‘physically literate’ term, considering the monist foundation of PL. Conclusion: The PL term has registered in the collective psyche and is here to stay, at least in a foreseeable future. The PL surge in the PE scenery may be seen as an opportunity to revisit the PE curriculum and PE teaching practices in order to cover a larger spectrum of PA activities for students. Meeting the admitted PL goal (i.e. nurturing autonomous, self-directing, self-actualizing and self-regulating PA-literate adults) cannot be achieved through simply passing on dominant forms of PA activities (whatever they may be) without taking into account physical activities that have become part of emergent and attracting communities of practice#FRE#
