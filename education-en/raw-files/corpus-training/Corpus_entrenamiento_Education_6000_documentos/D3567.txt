#ITI#Ableism, racism, and the quality of life of Black, Indigenous, people of colour with intellectual and developmental disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Research indicates Black, Indigenous, people of colour (BIPOC) with intellectual and developmental disabilities face disparities in quality of life outcomes. This study's aim was to examine how ableism and racism impacted the quality of life of BIPOC with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Methods: Using a multilevel linear regression, we analysed secondary quality of life outcome data from Personal Outcome Measures® interviews with 1393 BIPOC with intellectual and developmental disabilities and implicit ableism and racism data from the 128 regions of the United States in which they lived (discrimination data came from 7.4 million people). Results: When BIPOC with intellectual and developmental disabilities lived in regions of the United States which were more ableist and racist, they had a lower quality of life, regardless of their demographics. Conclusion: Ableism and racism are a direct threat to BIPOC with intellectual and developmental disabilities' health, wellbeing, and overall quality of life#FRE#
