#ITI#The Museum of Instructional Design: an Examination of Learner Experiences & Usability in a Collaborative 3D Virtual Learning Environment#FTI#
#IRE#This study examines learner experiences in the Museum of Instructional Design (MID), a 3D Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) developed using Mozilla Spoke and Hubs, focusing on Instructional Design and Technology (IDT) education. The MID utilizes a museum theme as a fundamental design element and allows learners to interact, converse, and develop exhibits to represent the IDT field. Leveraging a multi-phase, multi-method approach, we analyzed the usability and learner experiences within the MID, gathering data via expert evaluations and student interviews. The results highlight the engaging and immersive nature of the MID, while also addressing the technical challenges and varying levels of comfort with technology among learners. The study further proposes several recommendations for course design in 3D immersive environments, underscoring the importance of learner autonomy, clear expectations, tiered challenges, and responsive instruction. The implications of these findings emphasize the potential of 3D VLEs in transforming IDT education and other fields. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2024.#FRE#
