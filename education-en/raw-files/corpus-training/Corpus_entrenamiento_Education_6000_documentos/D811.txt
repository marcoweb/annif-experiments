#ITI#Teaching critical reflection in health professions education with transformative-vygotskian praxis#FTI#
#IRE# Reflective practice is a complex concept to adequately describe, communicate about and, ultimately, teach. Unrelieved tensions about the concept persist within the health professions education (HPE) literature owing to reflection’s diverse theoretical history. Tensions extend from the most basic, e.g., what is reflection and what are its contents, to the complex, e.g., how is reflection performed and whether it should be evaluated. Nonetheless, reflection is generally seen as vital to HPE, because it imparts crucial strategies and awareness to learners in their professional practices. In this article, we explore both conceptual and pedagogical dimensions of teaching for reflection. We address the concept of reflection, its application to practice, and how to remain faithful to transformative, critical pedagogy when teaching for it. We present (a) an analysis of two theories of education in HPE: Transformative Learning and Vygotskian Cultural Historical Theory. We (b) outline a pedagogical approach that applies Piotr Gal’perin’s SCOBA: schema for the complete orienting basis of an action. We then employ (a) and (b) to provide affordances for developing materials for educational interventions across HPE contexts#FRE#
