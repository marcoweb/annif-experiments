#ITI#School Demands and Resources as Predictors of Student Burnout Among High School Students#FTI#
#IRE#The demand-resource framework is widely used to predict burnout in occupational context. This cross-sectional study aimed to explore the links of school demands and resources to student burnout. Six hundred and ninety-six Hungarian students from secondary schools participated in the data collection using online survey method in classrooms. Independent t-test, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) were utilized during the analysis procedure. Statistical analysis revealed gender differences in student burnout, with girls scoring higher on “inadequacy” and “exhaustion” scales. Correlation analysis showed resources to be linked positively with burnout (0.24 < r < 0.57), while demands were negatively associated (− 0.15 < r < − 0.65). SEM results demonstrated school demands and student burnout to be positively related, while resources and symptoms were negatively associated. The results supported the usefulness of the school demand–resource framework in the exploration of student burnout. The findings showed demands and resources indicate two opposite processes in the development of burnout. We discuss the findings in the context of possible intervention methods which should be further investigated in future research#FRE#
