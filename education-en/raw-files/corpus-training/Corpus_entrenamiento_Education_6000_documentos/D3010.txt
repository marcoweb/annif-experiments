#ITI#It Matters Long Before: How Early Exposure to Faculty and Advisors at Baccalaureate Institutions Relates to Upward Transfer#FTI#
#IRE# A missing component in the current transfer literature is how community college students’ exposure to faculty and/or advisors at baccalaureate institutions early in their educational journey, such as meeting with transfer advisors or faculty members from a baccalaureate college or university, may shape their longer-term transfer outcomes. Our research addresses this gap, drawing upon longitudinal survey data and propensity score matching. The findings reveal a positive relationship between early exposure and transfer, suggesting that when students gain exposure to and potentially receive support from faculty and advisors at baccalaureate institutions, they may be better prepared for the upward transfer process. Our study highlights the role played by the transfer-receiving end in assisting community college students to fulfill their transfer aspirations. The larger transfer research agenda must continue to delve into the specific ways in which baccalaureate institutions can play a substantive role in preparing and supporting students both prior to and after transfer#FRE#
