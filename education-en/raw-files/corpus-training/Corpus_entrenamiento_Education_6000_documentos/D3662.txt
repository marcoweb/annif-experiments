#ITI#Applying experiential learning theory to student activism#FTI#
#IRE#The re-emergence of student activism on college campuses in the U.S. has provoked questions about its educative function in higher education. Analysed through the lens of Kolb’s experiential learning theory cycle, individual interviews with self-identifying student activists from across the U.S. reveal that activism engages students in learning about social issues and critical social analysis, social change processes, and themselves. Consonant with the bases of Kolb’s idealised experiential learning cycle, student activists learn through having concrete experiences, engaging in reflective observation, developing abstract conceptualisation, and performing active experimentation. In addition to actively pursuing knowledge for themselves, student activists work to facilitate experiential learning opportunities for others, including peers as well as adults. As such, activism on campus serves as a vehicle for student-led teaching and learning#FRE#
