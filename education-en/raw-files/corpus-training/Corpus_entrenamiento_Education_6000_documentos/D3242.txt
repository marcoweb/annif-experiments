#ITI#Lessons Learned from Online Learning at Scale: a Study of Exemplar Learning Organizations#FTI#
#IRE#As the areas of education and workforce training tend more toward online training, they have emphasized the rapid setup and expansion of online environments. This scaling-up and scaling-out of training programs can be difficult, but there are examples of success available for us to learn from. To capture the lessons learned, we conducted semi-structured interviews across academic, public, private, and non-profit organizations. Using deductive thematic analysis, three major groups of determinants were identified: technological infrastructure, human infrastructure, and governance. A framework consisting of three actionable recommendations was created to facilitate online learning organizational scaling-up including learner (learning experiences and user-friendly design), technical (technical competencies and the use of integrated data), and management (technical competencies for both learners and instructors as well as the use of integrated data) factors#FRE#
