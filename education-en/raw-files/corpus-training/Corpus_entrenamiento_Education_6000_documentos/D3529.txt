#ITI#Technology first: The impact on technology availability for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Background: In the United States, 16 states have adopted Technology First initiatives to improve people with intellectual and developmental disabilities' access to technology. Method: Our aim was to examine if Technology First initiatives impact the allocation of technology in Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. To do so, we analysed HCBS programs from across the United States in fiscal year 2021. Results: Technology First states were more likely to offer telehealth service delivery in their HCBS programs. However, we found few other significant differences in allocation of technology – the number of people receiving and projected spending – based on states' Technology First status. Conclusions: While these findings do not mean that there is no value in Technology First initiatives, it appears these initiatives have yet to truly impact resource allocation when it comes to HCBS#FRE#
