#ITI#An exploration of spillover effects: evidence from threat-induced education reform#FTI#
#IRE# This study explores spillover effects between national security and education issues. I examine whether the rise of new foreign threats is correlated with education issues rising onto the congressional agenda and with the passage of education laws. To answer this question several data sources on military conflicts and congressional activity from 1947–2015 were combined. I estimate the relationship between changes in deployed troops, the presence of education issues on the congressional agenda, and the passage of education laws. I find that total troop changes were a significant predictor of the passage of education legislation. This relationship is partially mediated by education issues rising onto the congressional agenda. The arrival of a foreign threat appears to create a shock that raises national security issues and subsequently education onto the congressional agenda. These findings help to explain delays to policy maintenance and the focus on short term goals in education reform#FRE#
