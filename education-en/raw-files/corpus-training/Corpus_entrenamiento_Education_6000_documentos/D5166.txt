#ITI#Culture, Goal Orientations, and Mathematics Achievement among Chinese Students#FTI#
#IRE#This study examined the relationships among cultural values, goal orientations, and mathematics achievement in mainland China. Structural equation models were used to analyze data on 350 Grade 5 students. The results showed that mathematics achievement was positively related to family-support and mastery goal orientations and negatively related to performance-avoidance goal orientation; that family recognition through achievement positively predicted mastery, performance-approach, performance-avoidance, and family-support goal orientations; that conformity to norms was positively linked to mastery, performance-approach, and family-support goal orientations; and that collectivism had a positive association with the adoption of family-support goal orientation, whereas emotional self-control positively predicted performance-avoidance goal orientation. Results of bootstrap analysis further confirmed the mediation role of goal orientation in the relationships between cultural values and mathematics achievement with positive indirect paths via family-support and mastery orientations but negative indirect paths via performance-avoidance orientation. Possible explanations of the results are discussed#FRE#
