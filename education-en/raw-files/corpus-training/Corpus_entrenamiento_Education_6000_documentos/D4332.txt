#ITI#Development of resilience among Chinese rural teachers: a social ecological perspective#FTI#
#IRE#Teacher resilience is regarded as a professional attribute that enables school teachers to cope with adversities in their work life in order to sustain continuous professional development. This paper aims to investigate the development of resilience among novice teachers in a primary school in rural China from a social ecological perspective. It attempts to trace the developmental paths of resilience among Chinese teachers working in an economically deprived area, and to elucidate their trials and tribulations as interactions with different social ecosystems affect the growth of their resilience. The paper’s findings suggest that novice teachers working in rural education in China have to deal with context-specific adversities that are shaped by educational tradition and school reform. Accordingly, the resilience development of novice teachers follows three discernible pathways, which lead to different capabilities. In the process, the interplay of multifaceted situational factors and the interaction among different ecosystems yield a range of cumulative influences on their resilience development#FRE#
