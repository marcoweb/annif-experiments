#ITI#An investigation of sessional staff support, development, and psychosocial wellbeing in Australian universities#FTI#
#IRE# Sessional academic staff form most of the teaching staff cohort in Australian universities. The available literature supports that this important staff cohort often experience precarious and insecure work, restricted access to training, support and development, and limited opportunities for career progression (compared to their colleagues in on-going positions). This national embedded mixed methods study explored the perceptions of sessional academic staff regarding support, development, and psychosocial wellbeing in Australian Universities. To complement the semi-structured interviews, sessional staff completed an online questionnaire. Our findings highlight that due to negative sessional academic work conditions, sessional staff have poor career progression and psychosocial wellbeing outcomes in the long-term#FRE#
