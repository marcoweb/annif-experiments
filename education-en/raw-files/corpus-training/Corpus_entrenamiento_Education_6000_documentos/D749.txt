#ITI#Common misunderstandings of phenomenographic research in higher education#FTI#
#IRE# This paper outlines the impact of phenomenography on higher education research and academic development. Interest in phenomenography as an educational research methodology continues to grow, but with interest growing faster than the number of experienced researchers, some misunderstandings of the approach have arisen and been circulating in discussions and publications, becoming self-reinforcing. This can cause misinterpretations of the meaning and implications of phenomenographic research findings, plus potential confusion for research students and others new to the research approach. This paper describes eight prevalent misunderstandings of phenomenography, explains what is missing in those ways of thinking about phenomenographic research, and speculates on the sources of such misunderstandings. A unique aspect of this paper is the focus on what phenomenograhy is not, as well as what it is, which is congruent with a phenomenographic approach to learning and development#FRE#
