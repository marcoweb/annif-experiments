#ITI#Attitude of junior high school students towards the study of science in Ghanaian schools: the case of first-year students in the Cape Coast metropolis#FTI#
#IRE#Attitude of students towards studying science is essential in their pursuit of academic success and development of interest to pursue science-related professions. The study investigated factors that affect attitudes of first-year Junior High School students toward the study of science in the Cape Coast Metropolis of the Central Region of Ghana. The standardised Revised Simpson-Troost Attitude Questionnaire (STAQ-R) was used to measure the attitudes of 162 students in seven basic schools. The results showed significant differences exist among ages of students in the same class (mixed-age enrolment) on overall attitudes toward the study of science. Also, teachers and classroom activities (motivating science class), self-directed efforts, family background, students’ interest and peer influence significantly contribute toward students’ attitudes toward the study of science. Gender does not significantly affect students’ attitudes toward the study of science. Overall, the participants possessed, on average, a positive attitude towards the study of science. Public education on gender equality in the study of science and the need for change in some socio-cultural practices that affect education might be yielding good results. School authorities and parents should continue to create the enabling environment that will help develop appropriate attitudes of students (wards) toward the study of science#FRE#
