#ITI#Emotional intelligence in undergraduate medical students: a scoping review#FTI#
#IRE# Purpose: To perform a scoping review to determine what is known about emotional intelligence (EI) in undergraduate medical education (UME). Two main questions were asked:A.What medical student characteristics are associated with EI? Are there correlations with demographic or other factors?B.What research studies have been done on EI in UME? For example, is there evidence EI changes over time as a result of personal experiences? Should EI be used as an admission criterion? Can EI improve as a result of experiences or deliberate interventions? Method: The authors searched four databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Education Resources Information Center, and Web of Science) for all papers published up to and including December 2020. Two reviewers independently screened articles to determine if they met inclusion criteria. All authors extracted and analyzed data. Results: A set of 1520 papers on the topic of emotional intelligence was identified, with 119 papers meeting inclusion criteria. Most studies were done at international locations with only 17 done at US medical schools. Seventy-five were cohort or cross-sectional studies. Study populations were mixed among the studies, with year of medical study, inclusion of other healthcare students, and participation rates among the inter-study differences noted. Conclusions: Numerous gaps in the literature on EI exist with several points being clear: (1) there is disagreement on the definition of EI, (2) it is undetermined whether EI is a trait or an ability, and (3) there is marked variability among the instruments used to measure EI. It is also becoming apparent that using EI determination may be helpful as a component of the admission process, higher EI is likely related to improved clinical reasoning, and higher EI contributes to more effective stress management#FRE#
