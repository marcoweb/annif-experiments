#ITI#Comparing self-reflection and peer feedback practices in an academic writing task: a student self-efficacy perspective#FTI#
#IRE#This study evaluated and compared student self-reflections and peer feedback on academic writing tasks with respect to both content and language. Twenty-nine undergraduate students were recruited from a university in Hong Kong. Guided by self-efficacy theory, the study provided three main findings. First, students tended to give feedback based on self-reflections rather than on their classmates’ work. Students with low self-efficacy tended to give feedback addressing similar areas to different peers. Second, feedback givers with low self-efficacy reported greater difficulties in generating ideas and conducting self-reflections, and therefore in giving peer feedback. The sharing of peer feedback became a source of learning for subsequent self-reflections and peer feedback. Third, high self-efficacy students were more active in seeking advice from instructors. They reported giving feedback based on both self-reflection and their peers’ work at both the micro and macro levels#FRE#
