#ITI#A constructivist redesigning of the learning space: the development of a sense of class cohesion#FTI#
#IRE#In recent years, the importance of the pedagogical and physical design of new learning environments has grown. Around the world, innovative pedagogy has been implemented to address, among other things, the development of social skills. In this study, we examined an educational program that is an applied example of the constructivist approach whose goal is to develop collaborative skills and team work. The teaching and learning methods involved 143 class observations and 149 students’ questionnaire responses, and then the impact of the new learning environment on the development of a sense of social cohesion was investigated among 82 students. There was a statistically-significant advantage for sense of social cohesion among students of the innovative program compared with the traditional class. Students interpreted the collaborative learning and social mediation that teachers create as key factors in the development of classroom cohesion#FRE#
