#ITI#When will scientists say yes? Antecedents, consequences and limitations of crowdfunding in research#FTI#
#IRE# Crowdfunding in research refers to raising funds by scientists for various research related tasks using crowdfunding platforms. In spite of growing academic interest, there is still a lack of understanding of the various aspects of the above concept. In particular, identification of antecedents, consequences, and limitations is important in predicting future intentions of scientists in the context of crowdfunding in research. We conducted qualitative research using 40 free-form interviews with management academics representing a wide spectrum of positions at public and private universities in Poland. Based on that, we hereby provide a comprehensive framework that allows you to understand why scientists will potentially turn to crowdfunding in research and how they perceive the very concept. Our results show that crowdfunding in research can be encouraged by the following factors: gaining access to funding, legal regulations, replicating successful experience of others, the possibility of obtaining feedback from the public on their research, networking, acceptance of the scientific community, and scientific and social relevance idea. In addition to funding science, building confidence in science and solving social problems are the consequences of crowdfunding in research. In turn, the limitations of crowdfunding in research include the following: uncertainty of results, ostracism on the part of the scientific community, fear of loss of reputation and trust in science, and insufficient adjustment of existing crowdfunding platforms to the requirements of science#FRE#
