#ITI#Culturally responsive teacher education: do we practice what we preach?#FTI#
#IRE#Research on culturally informed pedagogies (e.g., culturally relevant pedagogy, culturally sustaining teaching, reality pedagogy) has been ongoing for decades, yet very few studies follow teachers into their classrooms after they are introduced to the topic. We conducted an intrinsic case study of three practicing maths teachers after they completed a graduate course specifically on culturally responsive teaching. Our analysis of the data revealed mixed findings. The participants demonstrated sociopolitical consciousness and affirming views of students. However, other aspects of culturally responsive teaching were absent or partial. By interviewing and observing our participants in their classrooms, we gained access to specific and authentic examples from their curriculum and instructional practices, which extended and enhanced their learning about culturally responsive teaching and prompted us to reconsider our course content and pedagogy. We conclude by advocating for continued research that investigates and exemplifies best practices in culturally responsive teacher education#FRE#
