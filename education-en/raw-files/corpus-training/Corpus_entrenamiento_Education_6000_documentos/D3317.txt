#ITI#Exploring Faculty Perceptions of Outsourced Professional Development for Online Teaching and Learning#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore faculty experiences with a professional development (PD) program designed to prepare them for improved online teaching and learning. The primary difference between this PD offering and others similar in content involves using an external vendor. The research question was: how do faculty perceive their experiences in an external PD program designed to prepare them for better online teaching and learning in an intentional community of practice? The researchers selected participants through a purposeful sampling method, collecting narrative data from eight faculty using in-depth, semi-structured interviews. An analysis of collected data revealed four emergent themes: (1) obtaining new knowledge, (2) confirmation of appropriate tools and strategies, (3) mixed learning experience, and (4) community bond. Although the participants’ academic backgrounds varied, most faculty obtained new technological and pedagogical knowledge by participating in the PD program. Some participants reaffirmed their previous knowledge; the PD program reinforced appropriate tools and strategies for these faculty members. Additionally, participants had mixed feelings about their learning experience. Some participants perceived the program as beneficial, while others felt the program repetitive. Furthermore, participants perceived a community bond. The investigation concluded with recommendations for future research. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2023.#FRE#
