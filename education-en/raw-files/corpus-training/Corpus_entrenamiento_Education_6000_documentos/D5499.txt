#ITI#Measuring Halliwick Foundation course students' perceptions of case-based learning, assessment and transfer of learning#FTI#
#IRE#Case-based Learning (CBL) is perceived as an effective pedagogical approach to improving students’ ability to transfer knowledge, concepts and skills learned in schools to real-life contexts This study offers a new instrument that captures students' perceptions of CBL skills and their ability to transfer the knowledge and skills that they acquire to their work environment and which exhibits evidence of reliability and validity. The measurement of self- and peer-assessment was also addressed in this study to examine this construct’s potential effect on the above variables. Based on a deductive-inductive approach, the study included three steps. In Step 1, the conceptual definitions of CBL were surveyed and analysed. Experts' review and analysis of these descriptions led to item formulation. In Step 2, qualitative and quantitative data were gathered from 95 hydrotherapy students enrolled in a certificate program (Halliwick Foundation course). To examine the predictive evidence of validity of the CBL scale and assess the research hypotheses, Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling was deployed. In Step 3, the qualitative data were analysed to provide a more-complete understanding of the research models. The structural model implied that higher-order thinking skills and students’ prior knowledge are the most effective factors that might directly enhance their perceived ability to transfer the knowledge and skills that students acquired to their work environment. Those constructs had also a mediating role in linking peer- and self-assessment to the perceived transfer ability#FRE#
