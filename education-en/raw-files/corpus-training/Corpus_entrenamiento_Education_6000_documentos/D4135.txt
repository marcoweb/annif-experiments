#ITI#Teaching topographic map- and image-based geomorphic analysis: an example from alpine glacial geomorphology#FTI#
#IRE#Cirques are often the most representative and numerous landforms in alpine glaciated watersheds. The readily mappable and measurable nature of cirques (especially aspects and floor elevations) may yield information about the climatic, geologic, and topographic conditions that created them. These ubiquitous landforms are the foci of an alpine glacial geomorphology exercise in an intermediate-level, university geomorphology course. The exercise involves a step-by-step approach using topographic maps and remotely sensed imagery to identify and map cirques, measure cirque aspects and floor elevations, and plot and analyze the resulting data. Students interpret their mapping and analysis results in the context of published literature, ultimately incorporating all into a research paper. Student comments and self-evaluations over time show that the exercise is an effective tool for learning glacial geomorphology, topographic map, and remotely sensed image analysis, data analysis, and report writing#FRE#
