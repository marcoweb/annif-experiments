#ITI#Behavioral Intervention Fidelity in Routine Practice: Pragmatism Moves to Head of the Class#FTI#
#IRE#This commentary for the special issue on integrity measurement in school mental health research advocates that pragmatism is centralized in implementation and fidelity efforts for evidence-based behavioral interventions (EBIs). Specific recommendations include focusing on augmenting existing practices and core element interventions; developing practitioner self-report fidelity measures; and emphasizing practitioner training in how to use EBI fidelity methods. An exemplar model of practitioner training in fidelity methods, featuring observational coder training and fidelity measurement feedback, is presented#FRE#
