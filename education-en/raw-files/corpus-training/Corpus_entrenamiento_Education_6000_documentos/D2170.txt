#ITI#Supporting new online instructors and engaging remote learners during COVID-19: a distributed team teaching approach#FTI#
#IRE# As the COVID-19 pandemic began, universities swiftly moved to remote teaching, posing challenges to students and instructors alike. This case study discusses how a distributed team approach was used to support instructors teaching four sections of a technology class for preservice teachers. Students struggled with stress, technology, and in some instances, meeting basic needs as the pandemic began. Starting with a common syllabus and assignments, the instructors and their mentor swiftly redesigned the course to be flexible and engaging without compromising academics. Collaborative course development and teaching helped minimize pedagogical and technological tasks so instructors could focus on meeting the unique needs of students in their course sections. This approach may be useful for promoting professional development and maximizing student engagement in non-pandemic times, too#FRE#
