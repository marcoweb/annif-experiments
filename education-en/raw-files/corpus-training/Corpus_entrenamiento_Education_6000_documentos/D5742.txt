#ITI#Social learning as a response to disasters: a case study in the Brazilian Amazon#FTI#
#IRE#Climate change and development projects towards the Brazilian Amazon have affected traditional livelihoods and imposed transformations on these cultures. In this context, this study aimed to understand the inner workings of the social learning processes in the riverside community ‘São Carlos do Jamari’ triggered by its historical flood. An in-depth case study was jointly constructed, and semi-structured interviews and focus groups were developed with residents of the community, leaders of the Movement of People Affected by Dams (MAB) and workers of the local civil defense. Our findings indicate that the main shifting elements that fostered and were driven by social learning processes are related to Community-Community relationships, Community-Territory relationships, and the Community-State relationships. MAB’s role as an educational agent is highlighted, while public authorities hinder social participation in shared management. The proposals of social learning framework are taken as a possible way of overcoming local vulnerabilities and expanding social participation#FRE#
