#ITI#Parental attitudes towards the inclusion of children with disabilities in Jordanian kindergartens#FTI#
#IRE#The present study aimed to explore parents’ attitudes towards including children with disabilities (CWDs) in public kindergartens (KGs) in Jordan. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 250 parents of CWDs and others without disabilities at the kindergarten stage. The results revealed that most respondents had neutral attitudes towards including CWD issues in public KG, and about 36.4% of parents held negative attitudes. The results of multiple regression analysis also indicated that the parent’s gender, age, having a CWD, and degree of disability, were considered statistically significant predictors of the parents’ attitudes towards including CWDs in public kindergartens. Implications of the findings and recommendations are provided#FRE#
