#ITI#An analysis of university academic integrity policies in New Zealand#FTI#
#IRE#Policy analysis studies conducted in various countries have highlighted strengths and weaknesses in university academic integrity policy documents that outline expectations for student conduct while undertaking scholarly work. Missing from the literature is a review of such policies currently in place at the eight public universities in Aotearoa New Zealand. Using publicly accessible documents from each university, this study conducted a content analysis based on five core elements of exemplary academic integrity policies: access, approach, responsibility, detail, and support. Results revealed that the majority of universities had policies built on principles that aligned with both educative and punitive approaches to academic integrity. While most institutions presented detailed policies, the documents showed room for improvement with regard to access and support. The study offers suggestions for enhancing the academic integrity policies of Aotearoa New Zealand universities and calls for continued internal review and revision as one step towards an improved culture of academic integrity#FRE#
