#ITI#Transition to adulthood of adolescents with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities: Content validation of the SGU-PIMD to support families#FTI#
#IRE#Background: For families with adolescent children, the transition to adulthood is usually challenging. This period may be extra demanding for families with a child with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities due to the child's strong and persistent support needs. To support these families during this phase and to facilitate the transition process of these adolescents, we adapted the Canadian skills for growing up (SGU) into the skills for growing up-profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (SGU-PIMD). The aim of this study is to determine its content validity. Method: A Delphi study with family members and healthcare professionals was conducted. Results: Results showed good content validity. However, the Delphi panel suggested minor adjustments to improve relevance, comprehensibility and comprehensiveness. Conclusions: The current SGU-PIMD can be used in practice for supporting adolescents with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities. However, there are also recommendations for research into the feasibility and acceptability of the instrument#FRE#
