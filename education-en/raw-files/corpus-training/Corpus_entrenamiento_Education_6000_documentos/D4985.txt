#ITI#Educational Desires and Resilience Among Black Male Students at a Hispanic-Serving Institution#FTI#
#IRE#Understanding the higher educational experiences of Black male students continues to be a pressing need for researchers, educators, and educational stakeholders, especially given data regarding their retention and graduation. Within this focus, research is needed on Black male students’ experiences and sensemaking within various higher education contexts. Using resilience and Mirza’s (2006) conceptualization of educational desire as a framework, this study examined how 16 Black male collegians made meanings from their college experiences at a public, urban Hispanic-Serving Institution. In particular, I explore how they narrated their Black male racialized and gendered identities in their college experiences and the strategies they used to pursue and attain some of their educational goals. Findings highlight these students’ educational desires and resilience as significant factors that informed their individual efforts and continuously centered the importance of their educational pursuits. I also find that their efforts benefitted from multifaceted support as well, such as family, peers, and institutional resources. Findings from this study have implications for understanding the ways that institutional environment and resources impact Black male students’ sense of self and educational pursuits#FRE#
