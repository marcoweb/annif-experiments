#ITI#Evaluating Model Fit of Measurement Models in Confirmatory Factor Analysis#FTI#
#IRE# Confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) are often used in psychological research when developing measurement models for psychological constructs. Evaluating CFA model fit can be quite challenging, as tests for exact model fit may focus on negligible deviances, while fit indices cannot be interpreted absolutely without specifying thresholds or cutoffs. In this study, we review how model fit in CFA is evaluated in psychological research using fit indices and compare the reported values with established cutoff rules. For this, we collected data on all CFA models in Psychological Assessment from the years 2015 to 2020 (Formula presented.). In addition, we reevaluate model fit with newly developed methods that derive fit index cutoffs that are tailored to the respective measurement model and the data characteristics at hand. The results of our review indicate that the model fit in many studies has to be seen critically, especially with regard to the usually imposed independent clusters constraints. In addition, many studies do not fully report all results that are necessary to re-evaluate model fit. We discuss these findings against new developments in model fit evaluation and methods for specification search.#FRE#
