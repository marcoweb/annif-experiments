#ITI#Group-Level Assessment (GLA) as a Methodological Tool to Facilitate Science Education#FTI#
#IRE#Group-Level Assessment (GLA) is a qualitative, participatory research methodology that can be used within science education, specifically to meet the Science and Engineering Practices dimension of the K-12 Next Generation Science Standards. In contrast to traditional qualitative research methods, GLA is a concrete methodological tool intended for large groups. GLA follows a 7-step process in which diverse stakeholders work together to generate, analyze, and prioritize ideas that lead to action planning. Emphasizing personal relevance, shared decision-making, systematic inquiry, and collaboration in the design and process, GLA is best positioned conceptually and theoretically within community-based participatory research and inquiry-based learning approaches. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe how GLA can be utilized as an innovative methodology to incorporate students’ lived experiences in science education. We describe how to conduct GLA and provide a case example of GLA in action conducted as part of a larger science education program with students and teachers in STEM#FRE#
