#ITI#Exploring the career expectations of domestic and international students in an emerging country context#FTI#
#IRE# International students are a valuable resource for their home countries, bringing with them new skills, knowledge, and perspectives. However, meeting their career-related needs is important to ensure that they are able to contribute to the economy and society. This study, which was motivated by the premises of career construction theory and intelligent career framework, compared the career expectations and desired work outcomes of international students from various origins with domestic students in Turkey. Data were collected from 660 students, 95 of whom were international students. Results indicated that while international and domestic students shared similar career expectations in terms of working in a healthy workplace, working with good people, and having opportunities for advancement, there were also marked differences across various metrics. Domestic students may be more focused on making a good impression on other people, while international students may be more reliant on role models for counseling, support, and guidance. The study offers several practical and theoretical recommendations#FRE#
