#ITI#In search of solutions regarding the sex education of people with intellectual disabilities in Poland - participatory action research#FTI#
#IRE#Full and equal access to sex education for all citizens is ensured by international legal acts. Research shows, however, that people with intellectual disabilities (ID) receive neither support in understanding their sexual rights, nor access to sex education tailored to their needs. Sex education classes at a special school in Poland are not compulsory for students with ID, therefore they can be omitted from the curriculum. The research aims to learn the state of knowledge about human sexuality and to analyse the needs, barriers, and expectations of adult students with ID as regards their sex education. The methodology used included a qualitative approach (Participatory Action Research) using group interviews (FGI) with 24 ID students ages 18–24. The results of the study indicate that students taking part in the study possess fragmentary and incomplete knowledge about sexuality. They listed TV, the Internet, and friends as sources of information, leaving out school (teachers) and parents. However, their interest and willingness to talk was very high. A didactic tool for sex education was designed together with the student and is being used in schools#FRE#
