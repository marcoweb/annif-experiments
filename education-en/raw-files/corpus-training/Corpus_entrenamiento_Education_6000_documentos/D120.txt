#ITI#Barriers to Access in Public Adult Literacy Education#FTI#
#IRE# This qualitative research article explores barriers experienced by a group of African American and Latinx adults who sought to enroll and stay enrolled in a publicly funded literacy class and how these barriers were related to policy. Barriers included (a) an inadequate number and type of available classes, (b) a lack of community awareness of classes, and (c) institutional procedures that determined class eligibility. Barriers were created as practitioners attempted to comply with government accountability policy and funding requirements. These findings provoke questions about whether accountability policies promote inequitable access to public adult literacy services for racially minoritized adults.#FRE#
