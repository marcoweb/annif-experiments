#ITI#Imagining a Trans* Epistemology: What Liberation Thinks Like in Postsecondary Education#FTI#
#IRE# Postsecondary institutions of education, similar to the broader society in which they are embedded, are steeped in and further trans* oppression. In addition, the knowledge produced at these institutions is inflected with trans* oppression, and continues to reify the notion that trans* lives and experiences are abject, abnormal, unintelligible, and otherwise impossible. In this article, I build from the work of Patton, Brayboy, Delgado Bernal, and Spade to propose a trans* epistemology. In doing so, I discuss how this new epistemological stance helps educators unlearn the gender binary illogic in which they collude, thereby (re)shaping education as liberatory.#FRE#
