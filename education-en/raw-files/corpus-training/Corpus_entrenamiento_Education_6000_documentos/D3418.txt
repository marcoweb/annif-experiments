#ITI#Global citizenship: preparing the younger generation to possess pro-environment behavior, mutual assistance and tolerance awareness through school engagement#FTI#
#IRE#In a context in which academics and policymakers across the globe emphasise the importance of educators acting to encourage citizens to possess high social concern for their environment, this article reports and discusses qualitative research that explores perceptions and actions from within Indonesia. The purpose of the research was to identify what is being done through positively regarded Indonesian educational programs to promote globally relevant social concern. Semi-structured interview data were obtained from a total of 20 informants consisting of teachers, students, vice principals for student affairs and school principal who are active in the school environment. The obtained data were reduced and analysed using triangulation techniques. Data collection focused on several initiatives including the green school adiwiyata program, which aims to look after the school environment and foster a pro-environment behavior, service-learning activities or voluntary programs that teach students the procedure needed to conduct mutual assistance with other people and the torch parade festival on religious holidays. An argument is made that these activities are perceived to be successful in preparing students to become global citizens#FRE#
