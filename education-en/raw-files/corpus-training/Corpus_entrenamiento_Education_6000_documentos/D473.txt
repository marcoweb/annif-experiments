#ITI#The schooling experiences and aspirations of students belonging to intersecting marginalisations based on race or ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status#FTI#
#IRE# This study examined how social constructs of race or ethnicity, sexuality, and socioeconomic status (SES) are multiplicatively associated with high school students’ schooling experiences and aspirations. Using a critical quantitative intersectionality framework to analyse data from the 2016 Minnesota Student Survey, this study found that the estimated perceptions of care from adults among American Indian/Alaska Native students who are both LGBTQ and free or reduced lunch (FRL)-eligible were the lowest across different groups, and that these students were also the most likely to experience exclusion by their peers. Among Asian/Pacific Islander students, sexuality was found to be a moderating factor in the influence of higher SES on plans to pursue post-secondary education. Implications for policy, leadership, and practice are discussed#FRE#
