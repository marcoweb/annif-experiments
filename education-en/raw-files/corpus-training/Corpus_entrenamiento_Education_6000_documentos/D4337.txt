#ITI#How do I teach? Exploring knowledge of reflective practice among in-service EFL teachers in Ukraine#FTI#
#IRE#This study seeks to investigate the scope and quality of reflective practice in ELT in contemporary Ukraine. 56 English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers were surveyed to gain a better understanding of reflective practice in the country. Data were collected using both a quantitative (questionnaire) and qualitative (interview) method. The results suggest that Ukrainian EFL teachers apply reflective practice consistently but not systematically in their teaching. However, the study also reveals a significant gap in the understanding of the concept of reflective practice between experienced and novice teachers. Teaching experience appears to be a key differentiating factor in using reflection as a critical lens for improving their professionalism. Generally, teachers prefer peer sharing and observations against journaling or even organised notes, which are viewed as time-consuming and eating into a busy schedule. Easier access to modern recording media would facilitate development of reflective teaching pr#FRE#
