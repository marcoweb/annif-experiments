#ITI#Making the A Priori Procedure Work for Differences Between Means#FTI#
#IRE# Previous researchers have proposed the a priori procedure, whereby the researcher specifies, prior to data collection, how closely she wishes the sample means to approach corresponding population means, and the degree of confidence of meeting the specification. However, an important limitation of previous research is that researchers sometimes are interested in differences between means, rather than in the means themselves. To address this limitation, we propose additional equations that expand the a priori procedure to handle differences between means, both in matched and in independent samples. Finally, implications are discussed.#FRE#
