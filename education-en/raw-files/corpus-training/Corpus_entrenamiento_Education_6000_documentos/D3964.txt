#ITI#Beyond pedagogy: the role of epistemic orientation and knowledge generation environments in early childhood science teaching#FTI#
#IRE#Policy documents in many nations, as well as international policies indicate that the goal of improved student science learning requires teachers to learn to use knowledge generation environments for teaching science. This is a particular challenge for early childhood teachers (kindergarten through grade two), who have historically valued practices like active inquiry, but have received little Professional Development (PD) focused on theories of learning and orientations towards knowledge. This explanatory sequential quantitative study explored the relationship between 30 early childhood teachers’ Epistemic Orientations (EOs) and their use of knowledge generation practices for teaching science. In particular, we noted patterns of teacher change in relation to a multi-year PD programme focused on teaching through knowledge generation environments. Findings revealed that overall, PD was successful at shifting approximately two-thirds of the teachers’ EO towards knowledge generation. In addition, teachers’ change in EO score over three timepoints was significantly positively related to their implementation of knowledge generation practices. This research suggests that most early childhood teachers’ EO is open to change through PD and teaching experience, but the degree of this openness differs between individuals. The implications of these differences for PD and research are discussed#FRE#
