#ITI#A good return on investment? Cultural identification through learning traditional music and language in Gaelic Nova Scotia#FTI#
#IRE#Language is often used to demonstrate group membership and to establish cultural identity. When the language is not readily available or is at risk, individuals tend to turn to other markers to develop their cultural identity. Using Leximancer for thematic and conceptual analyses of interviews with ten accomplished musicians in Nova Scotia, Canada, we argue that the commitment to learning music and dance may act as a channel to learning Scottish Gaelic, a threatened local heritage language. Drawing on Norton's construct of investment in language learning, we consider the extent to which participants commit to learning the language and the music/dance for their identification to the Gaelic culture. Given that Gaelic music and dance traditions remain healthy, even as the language is declining, the results of our research have significant implications for language revitalisation efforts#FRE#
