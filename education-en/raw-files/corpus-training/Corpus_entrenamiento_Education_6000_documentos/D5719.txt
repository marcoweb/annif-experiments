#ITI#Attitudes and self-efficacy of early childhood educators towards the inclusion of children with disability in day-care#FTI#
#IRE#Educators’ preparedness to include children with disability in day-care is key to the success of early childhood inclusion. This study examines the relationship between attitudes and self-efficacy as key predictors of preparedness for inclusion. The study was conducted in Switzerland, a country with a young tradition of inclusive early childhood care and education, (ECEC) but with increasing numbers of children with disability in public day-care facilities. Early childhood educators (N = 214) completed a questionnaire on their feelings, beliefs, self-efficacy, and behavioural intentions. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse paths of effects of participants’ background on behavioural intentions. Results show that inclusive ECEC experience, private interactions and training on disability were associated with higher behavioural intentions. This effect was mediated by participants’ self-efficacy and their beliefs. General ECEC experience was directly associated with lower behavioural intentions. Implications for research and practice are discussed#FRE#
