#ITI#Diversified patterns and future prospects of international student mobility: a multi-level analysis from global and Asian perspectives#FTI#
#IRE# While most literature examines the determinants of international student mobility on a single scale, either global, regional, or national, differences between various patterns are under-investigated. To address this gap, this article explores the determinants of international student mobility at three distinct levels: global, Asian-outward, and intra-Asian. Secondary data from international databases are collected to test the effects of economic, linguistic, educational, technological, and geographical factors at each level. Findings reveal significant variation between intra-Asian student mobility and the other two levels. More specifically, while pull factors of the destination countries are salient to global and Asian outward mobility, intra-Asian mobility is predominantly influenced by push factors of the source countries. We then interpret how differences in macro socio-economic conditions shape uneven mobility dynamics replicated at the global and regional levels. Suggestions for future research on Asian higher education and international student mobility are also presented#FRE#
