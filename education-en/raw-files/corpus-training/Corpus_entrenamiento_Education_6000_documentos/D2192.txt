#ITI#The development and validation of a teacher education digital literacy and digital pedagogy evaluation#FTI#
#IRE# K-12 educators’ digital literacy skills have been designated as a national and state priority by education and accreditation agencies in Texas, resulting in the need for curriculum alignments to the 2017 ISTE Standards for Educators and implementation of a digital literacy evaluation. The purpose of this validation study was to develop a Digital Literacy Evaluation as a diagnostic tool for digital literacy and digital pedagogy of pre-service teachers. Using a convergent mixed methods design, data were collected through a quantitative pilot study and a qualitative expert panel review. The results indicated that the instrument exhibited strong internal consistency and content validity. Next steps include the implementation of the Digital Literacy Evaluation and the development of a digital literacy curriculum for pre-service teachers#FRE#
