#ITI#The effectiveness of augmented reality for English vocabulary instruction of Greek students with intellectual disability#FTI#
#IRE#For students with intellectual disability the need for effective teaching strategies in Foreign Language Learning is imperative. In recent years, the advent of Augmented Reality (AR) in Special Education has shown promising results. In the present research an AR intervention for English vocabulary instruction of three students with intellectual disability (ID) was implemented. A multiple probe across participants design was used to examine the effectiveness of an AR intervention on the students’ responses regarding identified correct vocabulary items in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in two thematic categories- food and animals. Results showed a functional relationship between the correct responses made during probe sessions and the implementation of the AR intervention for all three students. In addition, a follow up phase was conducted in order to evaluate the maintained outcomes, suggesting that there was a positive maintenance effect. Social validity was also assessed, indicating that the intervention package was practical and useful. Limitations of the present study and suggestions for future research are also discussed#FRE#
