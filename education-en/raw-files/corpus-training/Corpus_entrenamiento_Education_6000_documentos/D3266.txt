#ITI#The AECT Archives: Elusive Primary Sources, and Where to Find Them#FTI#
#IRE#Primary sources are the foundations of historical research because they are artifacts representing first-hand accounts or connections to the event, time, or place being investigated. The reality is that many IDT researchers do not have training in historical source analysis, nor do many researchers know where to find primary sources in the field of IDT, or how to conduct historical research if interested. Thus, this article retraces the history of the Association for Educational Communication and Technology’s archive, and reveals where primary sources are located. The article details the history of the AECT archive to understand its significance in research. Next, a description on how to begin an archival visit, how archives function, and how to research within the archive is given – including examples. Last, the authors discuss the importance of historical archive preservation and research to the field of IDT#FRE#
