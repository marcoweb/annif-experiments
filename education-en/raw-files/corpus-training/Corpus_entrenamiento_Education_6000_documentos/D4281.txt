#ITI#Developing trauma-informed university supports for refugee background students in Australia: Refocusing through an ethics of care lens#FTI#
#IRE#The growing literature on access, participation, and success of refugees entering higher education has illustrated the myriad challenges that this cohort faces. Much of this research has rightly focused on the student perspective, exploring the barriers and challenges that impede entry, engagement, and achievement. Relatedly, there is growing attention to the need for trauma-informed support, particularly following the impacts of COVID on learning. This article takes these challenges as a departure point to adjust the gaze on universities and ask what needs to be considered and implemented in order to develop better student supports. We use Tronto’s (2013) notion of ethics of care—examining issues of attentiveness (caring about), responsibility (caring for), competence (caregiving), responsiveness (care receiving), and trust (caring with)—to carefully probe how universities can develop trauma-informed supports that are more caring and nuanced, not only for students from refugee backgrounds but for all students. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
