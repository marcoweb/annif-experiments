#ITI#Perceived Teacher Discrimination and Academic Achievement Among Urban Caribbean Black and African American Youth: School Bonding and Family Support as Protective Factors#FTI#
#IRE# This study examined the relations of perceived teacher discrimination, school bonding, and family support to academic achievement among 1,122 urban Caribbean Black and African American adolescents. Results revealed that teacher discrimination was negatively related to academic achievement for urban Caribbean Black and African American adolescents with school bonding and emotional family support mediating the relationship. School bonding was a protective factor for both adolescent groups, but emotional family support for urban Caribbean Black adolescents only. Implications for school counselors and educators are discussed.#FRE#
