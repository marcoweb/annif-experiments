#ITI#Perceived academic performance explained by school climate, positive psychological variables and life satisfaction#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Adolescents spend a large percentage of their time at school, where learning and achievement are important activities that are vital to their future educational success and subsequent career opportunities. However, studies reveal a significant drop in satisfaction and performance during the teenage years. Aim: Based on the ecological model, this study aims to explore the relationship dynamics between contextual (school climate) and psychological (emotional intelligence and resilience) variables, life satisfaction and perceived academic performance, analysing, to this end, four theoretical models grounded in previous research. Sample: The sample comprised a total of 1397 adolescents aged between 12 and 16 years from the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country (northern Spain). Analysis: The Equations 6.2 program was used to estimate the measurement model and the structural models, using the robust maximum likelihood procedure. Results: School climate and life satisfaction were found to directly influence perceived academic performance, whereas emotional intelligence and resilience did so indirectly, with the full mediation of life satisfaction. Conclusions: These results have important educational implications, since they reveal existing relationship dynamics, which should serve as a basis for the effective implementation of school programs. They also indicate how important it is for adolescents to be psychologically well-adjusted and satisfied with their lives, in order for them to perform optimally at school#FRE#
