#ITI#Evaluating Restrictive Models in Educational and Behavioral Research: Local Misfit Overrides Model Tenability#FTI#
#IRE# The frequent practice of overall fit evaluation for latent variable models in educational and behavioral research is reconsidered. It is argued that since overall plausibility does not imply local plausibility and is only necessary for the latter, local misfit should be considered a sufficient condition for model rejection, even in the case of omnibus model tenability. The argument is exemplified with a comparison of the widely used one-parameter and two-parameter logistic models. A theoretically and practically relevant setting illustrates how discounting local fit and concentrating instead on overall model fit may lead to incorrect model selection, even if a popular information criterion is also employed. The article concludes with the recommendation for routine examination of particular parameter constraints within latent variable models as part of their fit evaluation.#FRE#
