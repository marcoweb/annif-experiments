#ITI#Knowledge and self-efficacy of youth to take action on climate change#FTI#
#IRE#Youth currently in secondary school will spend most of their adult life in a hotter climate associated with climate change (CC). This study investigated attitudes of youth living in an Australian Biosphere Reserve to identify their understanding of CC causes, impact, and mitigation measures, as well as their feelings of self-efficacy and hope. An online survey of 425 youth found that although participants reported a high level of understanding of impacts, they had significant knowledge gaps regarding the most effective measures to mitigate CC. In addition, youth expressed little hope that society will take action, and a lowered sense of self-efficacy. Significant gender and age differences were found for knowledge, experience, and concern about CC impacts, as well as perceptions of how well school had prepared them for navigating the impacts of CC. These findings inform communication and education interventions to mobilise youth to respond to the global climate crisis#FRE#
