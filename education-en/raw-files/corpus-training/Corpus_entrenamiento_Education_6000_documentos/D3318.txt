#ITI#Online Learning Ability of Chinese University Students and Its Influencing Factors#FTI#
#IRE#This study focuses on the online learning abilities of university students, a crucial skill in today’s digital age. This research collected data from students (n = 945) from China with a questionnaire of 40 questions in two scales. The researchers made factor analyses concerning university students’ online learning ability, which included 19 Likert scale questions, and the influencing factors on online learning ability, which had 15 Likert scale questions. The former analysis yielded two factors that explained the students’ online learning ability: students’ ability in self-regulation and innovation; and ability in technology control, and information processing. The latter yielded two factors influencing the students’ online learning ability: using learning resources; external support. Comparative analyses were also made, with results showing that the independent variables of gender, educational level, major, and family economic situation significantly influenced certain variables. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2024.#FRE#
