#IRE#We present the motivations and meaning-making processes bolstering minoritized faculty’s daily efforts to disrupt institutional forms of oppression and imagine more equitable institutions. Through critical in-depth phenomenological interviewing (CIPI), we profile the experiences of minoritized faculty (N = 6) within the professional discipline of counselor education. Participants represented multiple racial identities, identified as cisgender men and women, and included diversity in sexual identity and ability. We utilize a critical race feminist (CRF) framework to analyze our findings and review the implications for institutional transformatio#FRE#
