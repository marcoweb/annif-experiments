#ITI#Virtual high-fidelity simulation assessment of teamwork skills: How do students react?#FTI#
#IRE# With advances in technology, new innovative methods for evaluating teamwork skills are emerging, however little research has been done into students’ reactions to such innovative assessments in an educational setting. This study investigated the reactions of undergraduate students to a high-fidelity behavioral simulation assessment for teamwork skills and explored some of the factors behind those reactions. 168 undergraduate students completed a simulation assessment and filled out surveys of reactions, perceptions, and personality. The results of a structural equations model indicate that reactions were positively related to perceived scenario realism, characters (chatbots) realism and design clarity#FRE#
