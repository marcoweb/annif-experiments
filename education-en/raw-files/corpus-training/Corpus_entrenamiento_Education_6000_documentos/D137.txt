#ITI#Placed for Success: Which Teachers Benefit from High-Quality Student Teaching Placements?#FTI#
#IRE# In the present study we consider whether certain pre-service teachers (PSTs) particularly benefit from high-quality student teaching experiences. To conduct these analyses, we connect student teaching and K-12 workforce data for six educator preparation programs (EPPs) and assess whether placement school and cooperating teacher characteristics predict the effectiveness of early-career teachers. Results show that high-quality student teaching placements especially benefit PSTs with lower GPAs and narrow effectiveness gaps between teachers with lower versus higher GPAs. These findings call for closer partnerships between EPPs and school districts and suggest that EPPs may wish to prioritize placements for PSTs with lower GPAs.#FRE#
