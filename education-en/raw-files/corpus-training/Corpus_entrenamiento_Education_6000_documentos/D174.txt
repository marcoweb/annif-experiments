#ITI#Research Use and Politics in the Federal Higher Education Rulemaking Process#FTI#
#IRE# This case study examined how research has been used in the federal higher education rulemaking process, through which the U.S. Department of Education implements programs under the Higher Education Act. Findings indicate that in this high-conflict policymaking process, politics infuses various forms of research use to create several overlapping categories of use (political-instrumental, political-conceptual, and political-imposed) that existing typologies of research use omit. This study demonstrates how previous conceptualizations of forms of research use should be expanded to account for these politically infused forms of research use. This study also uncovered consequences of widespread political research use in rulemaking, including a general distrust of research presented in the process and political actors using the same or similar data to reach different conclusions.#FRE#
