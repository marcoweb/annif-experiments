#ITI#A feminist critical heuristic for educational policy analysis: U.S. social emotional learning policy#FTI#
#IRE# Social emotional learning (SEL) aims to promote student well-being, including healthy relationships that are free from harm like gender-based-violence (GBV). We investigated U.S. SEL policy through the lens of GBV, and how policy in the New York State (NYS) context operates to actualize or constrain SEL aims. To do so, we developed and applied a novel feminist critical policy analysis (FCPA) heuristic. Key findings revealed that the NYS policy neglected to address GBV experienced by adolescent girls, and the overall absent presence of gender within the policy underscores concern for implementable SEL best practices. We conclude with implications for research, policy, and practice#FRE#
