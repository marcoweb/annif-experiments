#ITI#The Performance of the Semigeneralized Partial Credit Model for Handling Item-Level Missingness#FTI#
#IRE# The semi-generalized partial credit model (Semi-GPCM) has been proposed as a unidimensional modeling method for handling not applicable scale responses and neutral scale responses, and it has been suggested that the model may be of use in handling missing data in scale items. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of the unidimensional Semi-GPCM to aid in the recovery of person parameters from item response data in the presence of item-level missingness, and to compare the performance of the model with two other proposed methods for handling such missingness: a multidimensional modeling approach for missingness and full information maximum likelihood estimation. The results indicate that the Semi-GPCM performs acceptably in an absolute sense when less than 30% of the item data is missing but does not outperform the other two methods under any particular conditions. We conclude with a discussion about when practitioners may or may not want to use the Semi-GPCM to recover person parameters from item response data with missingness.#FRE#
