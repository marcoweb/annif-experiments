#ITI#A curricular Delphi study to improve the science education of secondary school students in Spain#FTI#
#IRE# A curricular Delphi study was carried out to help improve and develop scientific training for secondary school students in Spain. Using the Delphi method, the authors analyzed the degree of consensus among more than 100 stakeholders' answers to the question, “What aspects of science education are considered desirable for a (Spanish) citizen?” From their answers, the authors identified a set of five “concepts.” Of these, the most relevant was “Science education related to environmental issues and human health, through the use of strategies based on discussion/debate and inquiry-based science learning.” This study compares these results with those of previous studies and makes proposals for educational reform based on the implications of its findings#FRE#
