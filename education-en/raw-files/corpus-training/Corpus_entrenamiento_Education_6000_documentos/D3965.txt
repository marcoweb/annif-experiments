#ITI#The science of science is fun: assessing the impact of interactive science demonstrations through everyday experiences and near-peer role modeling#FTI#
#IRE#Science demonstrations are a simple, cost-effective method of improving interest in STEM and highlighting the diversity of scientists, which can impact audience members’ sense of belonging and, in turn, influence self-efficacy. However, the pedagogy of science demonstrations has been criticized as creating a power imbalance between the presenter and audience, for being too far removed from the audience’s prior experiences, and for lacking interactivity. We report here on an intervention that designed demonstration-experiments to address a lack of interactivity while supporting interest; contextualized demonstrations within everyday experiences to address a lack of prior experiences and support interest, and implemented a near-peer role modeling strategy through high school near-peer role models to address power imbalances while supporting self-efficacy and expanding fourth-grade students’ perceptions of who can be a scientist. The study explores the effects of the intervention using a pre-post survey design analyzed by repeated measures multiple analysis of variance (rmMANOVA) (n = 444). Significant improvement was observed for all motivational variables. These results suggest that interactive science demonstrations focused on students’ everyday experiences may be an effective strategy to foster STEM interest and self-efficacy and to improve perceptions of who can be a scientist when enacted through high school near-peer role models#FRE#
