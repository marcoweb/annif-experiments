#ITI#Another brick in the wall of ed-tech failures? A systematic literature review of the FATIH project in Turkey from the perspective of in-service teachers#FTI#
#IRE# The FATIH project was the largest K-12 level ed-tech integration project in Turkey. Its aim was to enhance the quality of education by improving technology in classrooms. To determine the outcome of the project a systematic literature review was carried out and the perspectives of in-service teachers were considered. The literature was searched for information between the years 2014 and 2022. A total of 22 studies were thematically coded, which yielded 170 codes. The results indicate that the project revolved around hardware and that the e-content was unsatisfactory. They also showed that the teachers were not prepared, that there were sustainability problems, and that classroom practice was disrupted. The underlying reasons for these issues were the sudden top-down start of the project and the recalcitrance of teachers towards it. As a result, it is recommended that ed-tech integration literature is referred to before launching such an initiative#FRE#
