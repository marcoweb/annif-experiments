#ITI#Perceptions and pedagogical considerations in professional development training for integration of an early literacy program in Kenya#FTI#
#IRE#The present study examines experiences of mentor teachers and their teacher colleagues following three days of professional development training for early literacy instruction and a literacy software program (ABRA). Four Kenyan teacher-mentors were interviewed and 34 teachers were surveyed. Training included program specific and curriculum integration content. Thematic analysis of interviews yielded six themes, which identified perceived barriers and facilitators to adoption and integration of ABRA in the Kenyan elementary school context. Consistent with integration models, barriers involved infrastructure and access to technology, and challenges integrating the pedagogy of the software within the constraints of the existing curriculum. These challenges placed extra burdens on the ‘ambassador’ role, a key strategic initiative, which may require alternative support for program continuance, adoption, and fostering teachers’ professional development. Ambassadors and teachers agreed on the majority of challenges identified. Recommendations were noted to address cultural norms to enhance accessibility of the software#FRE#
