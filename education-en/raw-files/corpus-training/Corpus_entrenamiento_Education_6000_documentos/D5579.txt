#ITI#Teacher profiles in higher education: the move to online education during the COVID-19 crisis#FTI#
#IRE#During the COVID-19 pandemic, teachers were forced to move their teaching completely online. While some seized the opportunity to learn and innovate, others experienced difficulties. This study provides insights into the differences between university teachers during the COVID-19 crisis. A survey among university teachers (N = 283) was conducted to investigate their attitudes towards online teaching, beliefs about students’ learning, level of stress experienced, self-efficacy and beliefs about their own professional development. Employing a hierarchical cluster analysis, four distinct teacher profiles were found. Profile 1 was critical but eager; Profile 2 was positive but stressed; Profile 3 was critical and reluctant; Profile 4 was optimistic and easy-going. The profiles differed significantly in their use and perception of support. We suggest that teacher education research should carefully consider sampling procedures or take a person-centred research approach and that universities should develop targeted forms of teacher communication, support and policy#FRE#
