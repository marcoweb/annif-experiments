#ITI#Critically Examining the Experiences of Queer People of Color in Culturally-Based Sororities and Fraternities#FTI#
#IRE#Guided by Queer of Color critique as a theoretical framework, this research project investigated the experiences of Queer People of Color in culturally-based sororities and fraternities (CBSFs). Engaging in a secondary analysis of two critical narrative inquiry studies (one focused on Queer Men of Color and the other on Queer Women of Color), we examined how systems of power and oppression manifested across CBSFs. In addition, we interrogated how Queer People of Color practiced agency when faced with oppressive settings. Findings revealed the politics of disclosure given anti-Black histories and religious origins of organizations, the different ways organizations regulated gender and gendered norms between fraternities and sororities, as well as how participants articulated an increase in their agency to resist oppressive norms in their organizations, especially after they graduated. We then provide implications for research and higher education practice#FRE#
