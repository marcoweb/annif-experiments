#ITI#The influence of interactive and static infographics on the academic achievement of reflective and impulsive students#FTI#
#IRE#This article examines the influence of static/interactive infographics on reflective/impulsive students' academic achievement. The study sample consisted of 80 undergraduate students who were divided into two groups according to their cognitive style (reflective/impulsive). Each group was further divided into two sub-groups based on the type of infographics (static/interactive) to be evaluated. The findings showed that interactive infographics are more effective than static infographics in improving academic achievement. Reflective students outperformed impulsive students in terms of academic achievement, and there was a significant interaction between interactive infographics and reflective students. This study may serve as a guide for educators and designers of learning resources in selecting the most appropriate forms of technology conforming to students' varying cognitive styles#FRE#
