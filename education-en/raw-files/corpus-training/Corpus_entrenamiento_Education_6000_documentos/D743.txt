#ITI#The development of the perceptions of graduate assistants and faculty professional working relationships instrument#FTI#
#IRE# Previous studies have examined bullying behaviors in K-12 education and workplaces, yet there are few attempts to explore academic bullying experiences in higher education. In this study, a survey named Graduate Assistant and Faculty/Supervisor’s Professional Relationship was developed and validated through measuring United States graduate assistants’ experiences with their supervisors/advisors (n = 484) and perceptions toward academic bullying and inappropriate behaviors within their assistantships. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted indicating three themes: (a) Future Preparation, (b) Recognition and Consideration, and (c) Interpersonal Misconduct, supporting a 14-item instrument measuring graduate students’ experiences regarding academic bullying and inappropriate behaviors within their assistantships in higher education. Implications suggested that some students had experienced certain kinds of academic bullying from advisors/supervisors. There is a great need for colleges and universities to develop rules and regulations to prevent inappropriate behaviors#FRE#
