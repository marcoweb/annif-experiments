#ITI#Coding moves: Design and research of teaching computational thinking through dance choreography and virtual interactions#FTI#
#IRE# Over the past 7 years, we pioneered the development of a program blending dance choreography, computer programming, and a virtual environment to teach computational thinking, broadening pathways for more diverse students. We investigated the ways in which upper elementary and middle school students creating dance performances for virtual characters utilize embodied ways of thinking to engage with computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Through quantitative and qualitative data analysis from five research contexts, we found that (a) students’ computational thinking abilities improved; (b) distinct relationships formed between social, embodied interactions and student engagement with the virtual platform; and (c) students shifted their mental models of who computer scientists are and what they do after our interventions#FRE#
