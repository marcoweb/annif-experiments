#ITI#Validation of a Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, and Outdoor Play Behavioral Intention and Perceived Behavioral Control Tool for Early Childhood Educators#FTI#
#IRE#Early childhood educators (ECEs) are highly influential role models in the childcare setting with respect to encouraging physical activity and outdoor play, and minimizing sedentary behavior among children in childcare. Measuring ECEs’ behavioral intention (BI) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) is one way to monitor their determination and ability to support these health behaviors. The ECE Movement Behavioral Intention and Perceived Control (ECE-MBIPC) questionnaire (56 items) was developed via expert consensus to fill the noted gap in tools used to measure these constructs among ECEs. A test–retest approach, via an online survey administered twice (1-week apart) was adopted to evaluate the reliability and factorial validity of the questionnaire with ECEs in Canada (n = 165). Cronbach’s alpha and test–retest statistics were used to assess reliability, while exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to examine factorial validity. The ECE-MBIPC questionnaire demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha > 0.85 across subscales) and acceptable temporal stability (> 0.70). A seven-factor solution was proposed by the EFA, with each of the seven behaviors loading onto their own factor; this solution explained 71% of the variability in the data. As the first reliable and valid tool to measure ECEs’ BI and PBC to promote physical activity and outdoor play and to minimize sedentary behavior in childcare, the ECE-MBIPC questionnaire will help to standardize the manner in which these psychosocial variables are measured in early years research#FRE#
