#ITI#Research-Practice Partnerships in Pursuit of Racial Justice in Schools: Navigating a Hostile Sociopolitical Climate#FTI#
#IRE# Grounded in a partnership among researchers, a racial justice organization, and K-12 schools, this study uncovers the challenges of pursuing racial justice work in a polarized sociopolitical climate. Specifically, we illustrate these tensions across three dimensions of our work: (a) establishing critical commitments with K-12 partners; (b) building organizational capacity for critical racial analysis; and (c) confronting internal and external resistance. Throughout, we highlight approaches for leveraging the positionality and expertise of our partners to create the conditions for promoting and sustaining racial justice work in schools.#FRE#
