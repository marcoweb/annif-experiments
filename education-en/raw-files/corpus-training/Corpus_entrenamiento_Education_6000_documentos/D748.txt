#ITI#Theorising new possibilities for Scholarship of Teaching and Learning and teaching-focused academics#FTI#
#IRE# Definitions and understandings of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL), scholarly teaching, and research are multiple and often conflicting. Reflecting on Boyer’s intention for academic work to be recognised as overlapping and interconnected, in this paper we examine some of the commonly assumed models of Boyer’s scholarship of teaching and the creation of SoTL, in light of more recent arguments for SoTL to be recognised as part of research policies and frameworks. We explore the implications of these conceptions for academics with a mandate to engage with SoTL, such as teaching-focused academics. Through our analysis, we challenge the increasing interest in defining, separating and categorising academic work as ‘teaching-focused’ or ‘research-focused’ and work towards acknowledging the supercomplexity present in conceptualisations of research and SoTL. We suggest a shift in SoTL scholarly discourse from a shared to a nuanced understanding that recognises the variation in ways people practice SoTL as a strength. To this end, we offer a trifocal framework of supercomplexity, theoretical reconstruction and an ethic of care. This framework appreciates the plurality of SoTL ways of knowing and doing as an opportunity, opening new vistas of possibility for theory and practice#FRE#
