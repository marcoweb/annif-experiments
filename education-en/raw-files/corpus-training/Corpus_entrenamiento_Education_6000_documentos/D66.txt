#ITI#Self-regulated learning (SRL) perspectives and strategies of Australian primary school students: a qualitative exploration at different year levels#FTI#
#IRE# There is currently widespread interest in how to promote self-regulated learning (SRL) among young learners to prepare the stage for success in later years. Yet, there is little research that explores primary school students’ perspectives and strategies which are known to directly influence their SRL engagement. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 68 students aged between 5 and 12 years in Prep, Year 1, Year 4, and Year 7. The findings suggest that students’ SRL-related views and strategies range on a continuum from simple and naïve in the early years of school to relatively complex and sophisticated in the later years. Year 4 and Year 7 students were able to describe their strategies in greater detail when compared with Prep and/or Year 1 students. Behavioural strategies were the most prominent, whereas metacognitive were the least identified, among SRL strategies reported by students. While the coverage of cognitive and motivational strategies increased at higher year levels (Year 4 & 7), it was interesting to note a decline in the reporting of metacognitive strategies. These findings have practical implications for developing appropriate expectations and SRL-supportive tasks and training programmes for primary school students#FRE#
