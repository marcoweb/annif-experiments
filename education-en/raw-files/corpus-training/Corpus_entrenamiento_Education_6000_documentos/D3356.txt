#ITI#The OECD as an arena for debate on the future uses of computers in schools#FTI#
#IRE#Computer education was an integral part of curriculum development and a priority of the OECD’s policy agenda at the turn of the 1970s. Based on an analysis of archival documents, programme overviews and publications, this article describes how the introduction of computers in the classroom was advocated by the OECD and, more specifically, how this fostered the creation of an arena for the production of knowledge. The article sheds light on the OECD as an arena for the pooling and channelling of ideas relating to the uses of school computers. It, therefore, not only fills a gap in the history of educational technology, but also demonstrates how knowledge was catalysed and disseminated by this international governmental organisation. Furthermore, the study analyses an attempt to intervene in national policy-making that was withdrawn before it was implemented#FRE#
