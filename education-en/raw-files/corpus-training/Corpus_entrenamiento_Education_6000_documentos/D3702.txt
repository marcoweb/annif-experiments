#ITI#The relationship between secondary education outcomes and academic achievement: a study of Finnish educational sciences students#FTI#
#IRE#A multitude of research shows that the secondary education (SE) outcomes relate with university academic achievement (AA). More research is needed on SE outcomes subject-specifically. We examined the relationship between the Finnish matriculation examination (ME) results and AA, study success (grades) and study progress (credits), of educational sciences students (N = 1,214) who were pursuing a three-year bachelor’s degree in 2007–2017. The overall ME results explained 15% of the variance in study success and less than 1% in study progress. Success in mother tongue, mathematics, psychology and health education in the ME along with 1st- and 2nd-year study success related positively with higher study success throughout the three years. For the 3rd-year study progress, the results were more mixed, and progress in the 1st and 2nd year was statistically significant compared to the ME results. In conclusion, it is recommended to consider subject-specific ME outcomes regarding student admissions and curricula#FRE#
