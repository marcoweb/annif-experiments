#ITI#Automated Assessment of Student Hand Drawings in Free-Response Items on the Particulate Nature of Matter#FTI#
#IRE# Here, we describe the development and validation of an automatic assessment system that examines students’ hand-drawn visual representations in free-response items. The data were collected from 1,028 students in the second through 11th grades in South Korea using two items from the Test About Particles in a Gas questionnaire (Novick & Nussbaum, 1981). Students’ free responses, which include hand drawings and writing, were coded for two dimensions — structural (particulate/continuous/other) and distributional (expanded/concentrated/other). Machine learning (ML) models were trained to assess the responses on the particulate nature of matter. For classifying hand drawings, a pre-trained Inception-v3 model followed by a support vector machine was trained and its performance was evaluated. The assessment model yielded high machine-human agreement (MHA) (kappa = 0.732–0.926, accuracy = 0.820–0.942, precision = 0.817–0.941, recall = 0.820–0.942, F1 = 0.818–0.941, and area under the curve [AUC] = 0.906–0.990). Students’ written responses were tokenized, and a dictionary of scientific semantic scores was prepared. The final model for the overall assessment of both drawing and writing yielded high MHA (kappa = 0.800–0.881, accuracy = 0.859–0.956, precision = 0.865–0.957, recall = 0.859–0.956, F1 = 0.859–0.956, and AUC = 0.944–0.995), which varied by the final classifiers of the models. There were some variances in the performance of the assessment model according to the school level. This study suggests that artificial intelligence can be used to automate assessments of students’ representations of scientific concepts in free-response items, particularly those drawn in a pencil-and-paper format#FRE#
