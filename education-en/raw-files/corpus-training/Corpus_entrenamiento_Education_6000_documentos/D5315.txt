#ITI#Academic stress: links with emotional problems and motivational climate among upper secondary school students#FTI#
#IRE#This study investigates the levels of and associations among academic stress, perceived motivational climate and emotional problems in students at Norwegian upper secondary schools. A structural equation model with a sample of 1379 students (M age 16.5 years old) tested the associations between perceived mastery and performance climates and emotional problems via associations with academic stress. Levels of academic stress and emotional problems were found to be higher among female participants than male participants. Performance climate was related to higher academic stress; it was also related to more emotional problems through its association with academic stress. Mastery climate was associated with lower academic stress, and both directly and indirectly (via academic stress) related to less emotional problems. There was a strong link between academic stress and emotional problems, and this was significantly stronger among female participants. Practical implications are suggested#FRE#
