#ITI#Virtual reality environment in pharmacy education: A cyclical study on instructional design principles#FTI#
#IRE# Background: It is crucial to use innovative tools to gain clinical reasoning skills through experiential learning in pharmacy education, and one of the most effective tools used in this is virtual reality. However, the lack of research that empirically demonstrates the instructional principles of virtual environment design, especially in the clinical setting, has resulted in a significant gap in the current literature. Aim: In this study, it was aimed to determine the instructional design principles of a virtual environment for the clinical pharmacy. Method: The study was conducted as a design-based research. The data of the study related to three components of the developed virtual reality environment in pharmacy education (VRPE). These components, scenario development interface-scenario development interface, virtual environment, and scenario, were collected through interviews, observation, document review, and a system usability scale. Instructional design principles for the VRPE were determined through analysis of the collected data. Results: The prominent instructional design principles of the VRPE were revealed as immersion, interaction, diversity, flow, aesthetics-ergonomic-universal design, informing, and retest availability. The significance of the study was the adoption of a holistic perspective in the design of a virtual reality environment for pharmacy education. In addition, one of the most critical features of the study was eliminating the expertise barrier in virtual environment design. Thus, it was concluded that the VRPE is an extraordinary tool that can be used for pharmacy education to promote experiential learning#FRE#
