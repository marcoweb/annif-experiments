#ITI#Openness towards diversity? Cultural homophily in student perceptions of teaching and learning provided by international and home academics#FTI#
#IRE#This article contributes new empirical findings and conceptual arguments to topical debates about internationalisation ‘at home’ through a comparative study on how undergraduate students experience and perceive university learning and teaching by international and home academics. Drawing on survey data from a research-intensive English university, the study shows that most UK home students prefer being taught by home academics, whereas international academics are appreciated for developing intercultural understanding and global outlook. As home students with previous international experiences and BAME backgrounds value international academics more than their less diverse home student peers, we argue that cultural homophily shapes students’ experiences, evaluations, and benefits of encounters with international and home academics#FRE#
