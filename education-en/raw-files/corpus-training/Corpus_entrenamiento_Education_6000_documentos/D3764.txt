#ITI#Addressing challenges and finding solutions: navigating the informal curriculum of publication training within higher education#FTI#
#IRE#The peer-review process used in most academic journals is critical for curating evidence-based knowledge. Although many graduate programmes expect students to engage in the research process, these programmes often do not mandate formal training for the publication process. With few studies examining the graduate student experience in the publication process, the current study sought to help address this gap. Specifically, we used a reflexive thematic analysis approach to look at 18, hour-long, semi-structured interviews with Education graduate students at the master’s and doctoral level. Using a revised version of Kolb’s experiential learning theory to contextualise the results, we highlight three main areas related to participants’ experiences engaging in the publication process: a) experiences and motivations, b) challenges, and c) pathways to publishing. Based on these findings, we offer implications for higher education to support graduate students’ readiness to engage in the publication process as future scholars#FRE#
