#ITI#Students' Perception of Computer-Based Tests in the Use of English Programme in Nigerian Universities#FTI#
#IRE#In the use of English programme of the general studies unit of Nigerian universities, computer based testing (CBT) has been introduced as a novel approach for writing examinations, as against the paper based test (PBT). For this reason, there is a need to ascertain students’ perceptions of computer-based tests in the use of English Programme, as this will provide empirical evidence that will aid in the improvement of conduct of the examination, amidst the dearth of empir the CBT application across Nigerian universities. Thus, this study focused on examining what students think about this using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). The participants of the study were 1,200 undergraduate students from a Nigerian university. A fifteen-item structured questionnaire titled: Students’ Perception of CBT in the Use of English Programme was developed according to UTAUT to collect data in addition to a focus group discussion. The questionnaire, as well as the focus group discussion, were used to collect information on the student’s perception of CBT, in relation to its: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions. A descriptive statistical analysis method was used to analyze the data collected with the help of the questionnaire, while qualitative analysis was used to analyze the data collected from the focus group discussion. The results of the study revealed that students have a very positive perception about the suitability of their use of English in a computer- based test, though they complained of challenges related to infrastructure. The findings of the study are significant to students, lecturers, Information Technology (IT) experts and curriculum planners, as this will help strengthen every areas of the use of CBT and aid in the improvement of its use by the students. Thus, addressing these challenges ensures that the results of such examination are reliable. It is recommended that studies such as assessment of students’ readiness for computer-based tests and on the suitability of CBT in other units of the general studies programme such as Natural Science should be conducted in state owned universities in South East Nigeria#FRE#
