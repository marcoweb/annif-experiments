#ITI#Unpacking the Power Dynamics of Funding Research-Practice Partnerships#FTI#
#IRE# In this paper two foundation program officers describe their experiences as funders engaged in supporting research practice partnerships in two very distinct settings. The authors set the context for their experiences and walk through the challenges and opportunities in supporting research practice partnerships. They also discuss how supporting these efforts create power dynamics between the strategic initiatives at foundations and the need for researchers to have independence in crafting research agendas for research practice partnerships. The authors provide some lessons learned and prospect how future engagements with research practice partnerships can be set up for success.#FRE#
