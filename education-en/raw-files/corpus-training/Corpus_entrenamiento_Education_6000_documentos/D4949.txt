#ITI#Unidirectional or Inclusive International Education? An Analysis of Discourses From U.S. International Student Services Office Websites#FTI#
#IRE#Over the past three decades, the internationalization of higher education has evolved from a marginal position to a central focus for higher education institutions worldwide (Knight & de Wit, 2018). International students, as important actors in internationalization, contribute to academic, cultural, economic, and technological developments, and global competency and reputation of the destination countries and universities. Although internationalization and international student engagement have been addressed in universities’ diversity, equity, and inclusion goals, few researchers have examined U.S. universities’ organizational attitudes and underlying assumptions toward their international students. Through a combination of neo-racism and critical discourse analysis frameworks, we purposefully selected 10 public and private national universities with a broad geographic distribution and analyzed their website discourses of support in academic, social, and cultural adjustments provided for international students and discuss the promotion of intercultural awareness for both domestic and international students. Findings show that despite a relatively high level of intercultural awareness in supporting international students presented in some universities, more provide limited support and present deficit thinking and even overt discriminative discourses on international students. We argue the need for two-directional communications and understandings over one-directional demands and expectations from universities to students in the globalized era. Findings also reveal the necessity for universities to promote intercultural awareness, implement more inclusive university policies, and improve their support for international students#FRE#
