#ITI#How Community College Staff Inflict Pervasive Microaggressions: The Experiences of Latino Men attending Urban Community Colleges in Texas#FTI#
#IRE# In this qualitative research study we illustrate how implicit biases held by college personnel hinders the educational success of Latino men attending urban community colleges in Texas. In particular, we identify how often well-intentioned educators are (un)aware of how often they perpetrate racial microaggressions against Latino men. Interviews with community college faculty, staff, administers, as well as Latino men were conducted in order to triangulate findings. Findings illustrate racial microaggressions and subtractive schooling were evident through deficit based assumptions educators held about Latino men, their family and culture.#FRE#
