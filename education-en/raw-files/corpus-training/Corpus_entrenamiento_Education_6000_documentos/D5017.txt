#ITI#A Temporary Solution to the Two-Body Problem: How Gender Norms Disadvantage Women in Commuting Couples#FTI#
#IRE#Based on interviews with 31 academics and 5 nonacademic partners, this article explores the experiences of academics in commuting couples, or those who live apart for work-related reasons. Using identity theory as a guide, this article explores how participants navigate their competing identities of academic and partner (and, for some, parent) to determine how to best accommodate their personal and professional obligations. Although commuting offered participants an opportunity to prioritize their professional identity, women in opposite-gender couples particularly struggled with the arrangement as they felt it came into conflict with their responsibilities and roles as mother#FRE#
