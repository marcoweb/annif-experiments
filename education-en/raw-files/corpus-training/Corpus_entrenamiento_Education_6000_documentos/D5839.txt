#ITI#Participation changed my mindset. Transformative learning about agrobiodiversity in citizen science projects#FTI#
#IRE#Within citizen science projects, learning about natural resources can encourage environmentally friendly behaviour. More empirical understanding is needed on how citizen science projects facilitate learning outcomes to support sustainable resource management, such as agrobiodiversity. Here we present the learning outcomes of a citizen science project where participants interacted with agrobiodiversity in landscape observatories in Flanders (Belgium). The observatories consisted of square-meter (m2) gardens planted with vegetable crops. Participants were asked to visit their m2-garden and to perform tasks according to a scientific protocol (e.g. harvesting). Most of the knowledge gained was practical, while some was more in-depth. More than half of the respondents changed their views on agrobiodiversity and about a third changed their actions related to agrobiodiversity. Transformative learning outcomes were more likely when participants reported having less prior knowledge. Participants cited the tactile tool of the m2 gardens and frequent written and informal communication as key learning tools#FRE#
