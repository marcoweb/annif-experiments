#ITI#Examining self-regulated learning as a significant mediator among social presence, cognitive presence, and learning satisfaction in an asynchronous online course: A partial least squares structural equation modeling approach#FTI#
#IRE#Using a 33-item 5-point Likert scale and partial least squares structural equation modeling approach, this study examined the role of 347 Chinese college first-year students’ self-regulated learning as a mediator among social and cognitive presences and their learning satisfaction in an asynchronous online course during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it examined the extent to which their self-regulated learning and cognitive presence mediated the influence of social presence on their learning satisfaction. The results indicated that participants’ self-regulated learning had a significant positive effect on their learning satisfaction. It also had a significant mediation effect between social presence and their learning satisfaction, as well as between social and cognitive presences. Furthermore, social presence played a significant role in participants’ self-regulated learning and their learning satisfaction through the mediation of their self-regulated learning and cognitive presence. Implications for designing asynchronous online courses are discussed. Implications for practice or policy • Course designers should consider how to leverage and increase students’ social presence in the asynchronous online learning environment. • Course designers should make it a priority to clarify learning goals, inform learning activity time, provide prompt feedback, design appropriate autonomous tasks, arrange appropriate social learning activities, and specify optional online learning paths. • Course designers should foster learners’ self-regulated learning, help them build online confidence, manage their time well, and overcome difficulty in completing the online learning tasks. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
