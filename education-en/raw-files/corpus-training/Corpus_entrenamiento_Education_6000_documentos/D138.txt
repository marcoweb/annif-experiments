#ITI#Estimating the Impact of Expulsions, Suspensions, and Arrests on Average School Proficiency Rates in Ohio Using Fixed Effects#FTI#
#IRE# Student removal became an increasingly utilized form of discipline since the implementation of zero-tolerance policies during the early 1990s. Evaluative studies have consistently found negative relationships between student removal and academic success. Majority of cases regarding student removal are for minor and non-violent offenses and literature in this field suggests that teachers’ biases and cultural misreadings widen racial disparities in school discipline and academic performance. Our study estimates the effects of suspensions, school-related arrests, and expulsions under zero-tolerance by exploiting within-school variation in school mean proficiency rates of Asian, Hispanic, Black, and White racial subgroups over a 3-year period. Our findings reaffirm consistent evidence that exclusionary policies have negative effects on academic outcomes. We also find evidence of differential effects by racial subgroup. The paper concludes with a discussion and policy implications.#FRE#
