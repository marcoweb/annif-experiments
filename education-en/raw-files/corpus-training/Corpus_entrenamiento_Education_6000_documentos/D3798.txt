#ITI#Using Read-Alouds to Teach Inferencing from the Start#FTI#
#IRE#Research substantiates that inferencing is a critical component to making sense of texts. The ability to make logical inferences is a key characteristic of proficient comprehenders that can be developed before children become fluent readers. This article argues for teaching inferencing via teacher or parent read-alouds to help young readers develop comprehension starting in the earliest grades. Highlighting the importance of inferencing as thinking through text, the authors explain the what, why, and how of inferencing, then promote its value as a read-aloud interaction with numerous pedagogical recommendations to support comprehension development and its assessment#FRE#
