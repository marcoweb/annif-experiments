#ITI#Standards of Practice: Core Competencies for LGBTQIA+ Directors and Professionals in Higher Education#FTI#
#IRE#These Standards of Practice inform the work of LGBTQIA+ directors and professionals and establish direction for the profession. Developed in conjunction with and approved by the Consortium of Higher Education Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) Resource Professionals, these 12 competencies provide: (a) a resource for current and future LGBTQIA+ directors and professionals to enhance their work and professional development; (b) guidance for institutions about what is foundational and essential when creating new positions, expanding resources, hiring, developing, and supervising LGBTQIA+ directors and professionals; and (c) guidance for emerging professionals considering this path in higher education. Keeping in mind the constituencies served, the identities of the LGBTQIA+ community, and the wide and complex variations in higher education, these competencies were scaffolded by two frameworks: social justice through an intersectional lens and the gamut of institutional life. These competencies are built upon the work of those who have come before us and are both concrete and aspirational. They are intended to advance institutions of higher education in support of LGBTQIA+ people and enhance and strengthen the roles of LGBTQIA+ directors and professionals as institutional leaders in the academ#FRE#
