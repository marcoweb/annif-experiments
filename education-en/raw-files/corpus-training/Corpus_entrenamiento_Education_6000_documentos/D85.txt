#ITI#Forced choice? Is bullying pushing non-binary students into cyber schools?#FTI#
#IRE# Little research addresses the schooling experiences of non-binary students; no prior work explores their experiences in cyber schools. Using unique data from a US multi-state cyber charter school, we compare the factors parents of non-binary students and parents of other students stated as reasons for leaving their prior schools to attend a cyber charter school in fall 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic). Despite a small sample size, we found statistically significant differences, with parents of non-binary students two to three times more likely to indicate mental health, safety, and bullying related concerns as motivating their choice of cyber schooling. There were no significant differences regarding physical health, and few involving academic concerns. We also note implications, and directions for future research#FRE#
