#ITI#Teaching human geography using a couplet game#FTI#
#IRE#Using games to teach is an interesting and worthwhile practice; however, the couplet game has not been described before. In this study, first-year students played a couplet game with their teacher at the end of the course. Each student was asked to summarize and write individual opinions on human geography in one keyword; then, the teacher wrote the corresponding or matching keywords. Analyzing the correspondences and the contrasts between couples of words, the students showed an improved understanding of human geography. The results suggested that the couplet game elicited students’ creative and independent thinking. This method can also be applied to other fields#FRE#
