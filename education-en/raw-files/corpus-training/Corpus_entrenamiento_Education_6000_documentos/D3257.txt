#ITI#Conversational Agents to Support Remote Personalized Instruction for Diverse Learners#FTI#
#IRE#Recent developments in Conversational Agents (CAs) have offered researchers new ways to develop personalized learning support for students that is accessible in various environments. Traditionally, CA learner experiences are accessible through home devices, including Alexa Echo and Google Nest, for tasks such as setting reminders, ordering products, and controlling smart home functions. However, there is an opportunity to expand CA’s range to investigate the role of CAs in guiding instruction as a novel digital learning modality for learners with diverse needs. This article introduces considerations for designing CAs that leverage aspects of personalized student learning paired with common pedagogical instruction accessible on demand. Guided by classical theories of multimodal learning and self-regulated learning, we describe how to design CAs to capture personalized student variables throughout the voice instruction. Finally, we discuss the implications and potential for CAs moving forward to meet diverse learning needs of all learners#FRE#
