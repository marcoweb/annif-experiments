#ITI#Impact of a game-based intervention on fraction learning for fifth-grade students: A pre-registered randomized controlled study#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Digital game-based learning is gaining increased attention from both researchers and educators for improving mathematics instruction. However, the evidence for game-based learning is mixed and research with rigorous research design and analyses are limited. Objective: Here, in a pre-registered randomized controlled study, we investigated whether a fraction game designed collaboratively by educational experts and professional game developers may serve as a useful tool to enhance students' fraction knowledge. Methods: We assigned French fifth graders to either an experimental group who used the game (n = 110) or a control group (n = 78) who received traditional instruction on fractions. Fraction knowledge was assessed pre- and post-intervention. Results: Results show that students in the active control group had superior overall fraction performance than students in the experimental group at the end of intervention. However, the game had a positive effect on decimal learning. We also found a positive relation between game performance and overall fraction knowledge scores at post-test. Contribution: The study highlights the importance of game metrics as indicators of personalized assessment tools. Given the increased usage of games in learning mathematics and the equivocal results on the effectiveness of these games, our study also highlights the importance of pre-registration and randomized controlled studies#FRE#
