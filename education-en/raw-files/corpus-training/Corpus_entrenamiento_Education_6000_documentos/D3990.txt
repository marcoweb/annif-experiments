#IRE#The aim of this research was to assess students’ ability to explain scientific phenomena by means of a POE pedagogical tool. To achieve this aim, we conducted home experiments in a digital environment. In this qualitative and transversal ex-post-facto research, 775 pupils (aged 13–18 years) enrolled in compulsory secondary education from the Canary Islands were recruited. Data were collected using a digital questionnaire (self-designed), which showed acceptable reliability (α = 0.8). According to the results, multimodal POEs with home experiments within multimedia settings were perceived by the pupils to be a useful tool for teaching science on day-to-day. Students also found the POE activities to be motivating and engaging. Lastly, we present the calculation of POE scores and a method for assessing scientific literacy#FRE#
