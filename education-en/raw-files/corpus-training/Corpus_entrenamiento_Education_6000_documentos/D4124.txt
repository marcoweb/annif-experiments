#ITI#A problem-based learning course to teach Brazilian biology students about the viral hepatitis from a health geography perspective#FTI#
#IRE#In this study we designed, implemented, and evaluated a Problem-based Learning (PBL) course to teach undergraduate students about Viral Hepatitis from a Health Geography perspective. The course was attended by undergraduate students with no previous experience with PBL from a college in the Brazilian Amazon state of Acre. The course design was based on a combination of features from different PBL frameworks, allowing the students to gradually switch from a content-centered educational environment to a student-centered one. The PBL unit was based on an ill-structured real-life problem concerning the division of a hypothetical budget among actions to fight Viral Hepatitis in the state’s municipalities. Student problem solutions indicated that they learned basic Viral Hepatitis and Health Geography concepts. Furthermore, perceptions of their own learning demonstrated that students regarded their acquired problem-solving skills and their knowledge of the course subject as their main educational outcomes. We argue that the combination of different PBL frameworks, the gradual transition from lectures to active learning and the social relevance of the course subject to students are among the putative factors that contributed to the course’s success. This study, therefore, provides insights into the design of PBL courses for students inexperienced in active learning#FRE#
