#ITI#Co-Teaching During Teacher Training Periods: Experiences of Finnish Special Education and General Education Teacher Candidates#FTI#
#IRE#Co-teaching is highlighted as an opportunity to develop inclusive practices. This study aimed to investigate how teacher candidates experienced co-teaching during supervised teacher training periods. Data were collected through pair interviews and questionnaires (N =22). The analysis was conducted through thematic analysis. Results show that the participants experienced both possibilities and challenges. Generally, they experienced planning and communication as time-consuming but as an opportunity to share ideas and knowledge. They experienced shared responsibilities and equal roles, but in some cases, inequalities appeared. Furthermore, they saw co-teaching as a way to meet diverse needs in the class, but some of the participants had some concerns regarding meeting the individual needs of pupils with individual educational plans (IEPs). Despite challenges, the results show that co-teaching is a valuable element of teacher training. Implications for teacher education are discussed#FRE#
