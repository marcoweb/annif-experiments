#ITI#The mainstream school experiences of adolescent autistic girls#FTI#
#IRE#Research into the school experiences of autistic adolescents tends to utilise predominantly male samples, effectively neglecting the views of autistic girls. This study explores the perspectives of three autistic girls attending a mainstream secondary school recognised for its good autism practice. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the girls, their mothers and a therapeutic member of staff at the school. Findings highlight the unique experiences of secondary school and common challenges including anxiety resulting from sensory issues and inconsistencies in staff understanding of individual need. Implications for practice include ensuring effective sharing of information about individual needs and specialised support for developing social skills, to enable autistic girls to navigate the complexity of female friendships during adolescence#FRE#
