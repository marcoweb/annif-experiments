#ITI#Mitigating the impact of family burden on psychological health in parents of children with special needs: Buffering effects of resilience and social support#FTI#
#IRE#Background and Aims: This study examined the link between perceived family burden among parents of children with moderate and severe disabilities and their psychological health, and the potential moderating roles of resilience and social support. Methods: 256 parents completed an online questionnaire including Demographic Information Form, Family Burden Assessment Scale, General Health Questionnaire, Brief Resilience Scale, and Revised Parental Social Support Scale. Results: Results revealed negative associations between resilience, social support, and depression-anxiety symptoms. Both resilience and social support played moderating roles in the association between family burden and psychological health. Social support buffered the negative association between family burden and psychological health, alongside psychological resilience. Discussion and Conclusion: The study highlights the negative effects of family burden on the psychological health of parents of children with disabilities, but also suggests that resilience and social support can mitigate these effects. Therefore, interventions should consider these factors to enhance the psychological well-being of parents#FRE#
