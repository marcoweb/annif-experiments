#ITI#The benefits of virtual fieldtrips for future-proofing geography teaching and learning#FTI#
#IRE#This resource paper explores the benefits of developing virtual fieldtrips to help future-proof geography teaching and learning in times of uncertainty and change. Drawing on a case study from a second-year biogeography module that saw cancellations to in-person fieldtrips in the first UK COVID-19 lockdown and the development of a virtual fieldtrip by the third UK COVID-19 lockdown, we offer some insights and lessons learnt to help other academics and practitioners adopt this approach#FRE#
