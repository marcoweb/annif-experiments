#ITI#What influences do parents perceive as supportive of school well-being and the inclusion of children with ADHD?: A qualitative study#FTI#
#IRE#A growing body of a literature recognises the importance of special educational needs (SEN) of adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Therefore, there is a current need for more in-depth insights into the factors that may help meet the SEN, well-being, and educational inclusion of ADHD students. The aim of this qualitative study was to assess the factors that parents perceive as being helpful for the school well-being, adaptation, and inclusion of their ADHD adolescents. The sample comprised 20 parents, aged from 30 to 60 years old, of ADHD adolescents. From the viewpoint of the parents, the teachers’ knowledge of ADHD symptoms, the use of educational methods respecting the determination of ADHD, special school aids and equipment, and the help of various professionals and psychotherapy with social skills training were considered to be supportive for school well-being and the inclusion of ADHD adolescents. Practical implications emerging from the results of the present study involve training focused on the development of secure attachment of teachers, awareness-raising campaigns about ADHD, and activities supporting teacher-parent cooperation#FRE#
