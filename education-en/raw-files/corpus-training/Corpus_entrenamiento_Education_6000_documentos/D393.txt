#ITI#A review of the penetration of Francophone research on intervention in physical education and sport in Anglophone journals since 2010#FTI#
#IRE# Introduction: Since the 1990s, the notion of intervention has expanded with growing interest in the analysis of practices in Francophone country. French-speaking research community considers intervention sciences as a specific field of research in sport and PE. The aim of this literature review was to characterize the penetration of Francophone research in the English-language literature in physical education and sport concerned with intervention since 2010 in the category ‘Education & Educational Research’ of the Journal Citation Reports (2017). This research was in line with the analysis of the papers presented during six Francophone congresses from 2000 to 2010 of the Association for Research on Intervention in Sport (Musard and Poggi 2015). Methods: The selection of articles was carried out in three stages: selection of journals, selection of articles manually, the second level of selection. The selection of journals is do in this category "Education & Educational Research" (JCR, 2017) focusing primarily on sport and physical education. Six journals met these criteria: Physical Education and Sport Pedagogy, European Physical Education Review, Journal of Teaching in Physical Education, Sport Education and society, Quest, Journal of Hospitality Leisure Sport & Tourism Education. Then, the selection of articles was manually analyzing all the publications of each journal since 2010 (almost 2000 articles) according to inclusion criteria "sport or physical education", "francophone authors", and "intervention". Each 46 articles selected was classified according to its theoretical framework. The last stage of selection corresponded to an analyze and an extension of the literature review by a French-speaking specialist in each theoretical framework. Results: The results show that French-language research on/in/for intervention is in close connection with the international tradition. Some approaches such as didactique, a technological approach, and course of action, have a Francophone specificity based on various international theoretical anchors; others such as motor learning, social psychology, ecological approach come from non-French-speaking international theoretical frameworks. Discussion and conclusion: These findings raise the question of the Francophone specificity of intervention sciences. Beyond particular French-speaking theoretical frameworks, concepts and concerns join Anglophone traditions. As in the international fields of ‘sport pedagogy’ or ‘praxis’, the Francophone intervention sciences are composed of a diversity of theoretical approaches and are focused towards an epistemology of action. These two communities can enrich each other and deserve more interaction and exchange#FRE#
