#ITI#People with intellectual disability and employment sustainability: A qualitative interview study#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Swedish employment rates are disproportionately low among people with intellectual disability and research on employment sustainability in this group is scarce. This study investigated employment sustainability among people with intellectual disability, with a focus on identifying facilitators. Method: Fifteen persons with intellectual disability who were gainfully employed and had been so for at least 1 year during the last 3 years, and 10 representatives from their employers, were interviewed. Results: Five facilitators were identified: (1) having tried various types of work, (2) liking to be at work, (3) balance concerning expectations and adaptations, (4) mutual engagement and flexibility, and (5) wage subsidies. Conclusion: Employment sustainability needs to be understood at individual as well as environmental and societal levels. In addition, both duration and progress should be considered regarding employment sustainability in this population#FRE#
