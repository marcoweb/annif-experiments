#ITI#Examining the relationship between language and cross-cultural encounters: avenues for promoting intercultural interaction#FTI#
#IRE#In the context of the exponential growth of multicultural campuses worldwide and the consequent need for students to engage in intercultural interaction, this article reports on parts of the findings of a study examining the relationships between learners’ backgrounds (language and intercultural experiences) and their intercultural views and behaviour. 155 students studying in a multicultural tertiary-level setting were administered a questionnaire. Based on the quantitative and qualitative analyses, two key findings were identified: (1) the importance of perceived spoken English competence and prior intercultural experiences on campus (as opposed to experiences in class or outside campus) as the most important predictors of intercultural behaviour and views and (2) evidence of multilinguals showing significantly more intercultural behaviour and positive views than bilinguals. This article ends with a discussion of the findings, their implications, and directions for further studies. Theoretically, the findings add to our understanding of the relationships between language, intercultural views and behaviour; practically, the findings shed light on promising directions educators can take to promote greater intercultural interaction among students#FRE#
