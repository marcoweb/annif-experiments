#ITI#Applying Systems Thinking for Designing Immersive Virtual Reality Learning Experiences in Education#FTI#
#IRE#Virtual reality (VR) in education has tremendous potential in providing immersive and interactive experiences for students. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) technologies and IVR learning experiences have been increasingly used in education settings to support a variety of instructional methods and outcomes by providing experiential and authentic learning experiences. Research findings indicate that IVR in education can provide many learning benefits (Hamilton et al., Journal of Computers in Education, 8(1), 1-32, 2021; Slater & Sanchez-Vives, Frontiers in Robotics and A.I., 3, 74, 2016) as IVR can afford learners firsthand experiences that are unattainable in the physical world, present opportunities for experiential and situated learning, and foster learners’ motivation and engagement (Di Natale et al., British Journal of Educational Technology, 51(6), 2006-2033, 2020). Researchers have also found that the successful integration of VR in education settings is contingent upon many factors, including access, support, time, teachers' beliefs of the value of the technology for student learning, and their self-efficacy in its use for teaching (Angeli & Valanides, Learning and Instruction, 19(4), 322-334, 2009; Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, Journal of Research on Technology in Education, 42(3), 255-284, 2010; Windschitl & Sahl, American Educational Research Journal, 39(1), 165-205, 2002), the context (Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich, Journal of Research on Technology in Education, 42(3), 255-284, 2010; Kopcha, Educational Technology Research and Development, 58, 175-190, 2010; Windschitl & Sahl, American Educational Research Journal, 39(1), 165-205, 2002; Zhao & Frank, American Educational Research Journal, 40(4), 807-840, 2003), and vision, leadership, planning and support, culture, professional development, curriculum and instruction, and partnerships (Levin & Schrum, Journal of Research on Technology in Education, 46(1), 29-51, 2013). We propose that educators adopt a systems-thinking approach, which uses a holistic perspective that considers the design of the instructional content and the broader context and interdependencies of various elements within an educational system for supporting the use of the instructional content. Examining the interconnections among design considerations for integrating IVR, including pertinent concepts, participant elements, educational procedures, and the results of learning (Lee & Wong, Transactions on edutainment I, 5080, 231–241, 2008) and the systems in which planning these IVR learning experiences will occur, is an essential stride in attaining a well-informed IVR-enhanced design for teaching and learning. This paper will discuss using IVR-enhanced instruction and learning in formal education while considering the various systems in which IVR-enhanced teaching and learning will reside to strategically identify and work within those systems for the successful integration of IVR. In this process, we explore relevant systems and considerations when creating IVR-enhanced learning experiences to assist educators and researchers in following a similar approach#FRE#
