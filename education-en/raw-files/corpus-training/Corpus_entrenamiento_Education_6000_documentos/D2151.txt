#ITI#Support provided for K-12 teachers teaching remotely with technology during emergencies: A systematic review#FTI#
#IRE# Emergencies can cause disruption to education. This study is unique in providing the first empirical systematic review on teacher support for Emergency Remote Education (ERE) from 2010 to 2020. A total of 57 studies emerged from the PRISMA search. This mixed-method study used deductive and inductive iterative methods to examine the data. The data reveal teacher support strategies from across 50 different high and low-income countries. Few studies focused on a teacher’s subject and the age range taught. In the examination of professional development provided to prepare K-12 teachers to conduct ERE, eight codes emerged from the grounded coding as; 1) prior preparation, 2) understanding ERE, 3) needs analysis, 4) digital pedagogical strategies, 5) technology tools, 6) frameworks, 7) digital equity, and 8) mental wellness#FRE#
