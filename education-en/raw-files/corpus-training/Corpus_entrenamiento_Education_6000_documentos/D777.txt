#ITI#How does a move towards a coaching approach impact the delivery of written feedback in undergraduate clinical education?#FTI#
#IRE# Feedback uptake relies on interactions between learners and educators Winstone (Educ Psychol 52: 17–37, 2017). Feedback that coaches using a feedforward approach, is considered to be more personal and emotionally literate Bussey (Bull R Coll Surg Engl 99: 180–182, 2017), Hattie (Rev Educ Res 77: 81–112, 2007). Many modes of feedback are employed in clinical teaching environments, however, written feedback is particularly important, as a component of feedback discourse, as significant time may elapse before a similar clinical situation is encountered. In practice, time constraints often result in brief or descriptive written feedback rather than longer coaching feedback. This study aimed to explore whether a change in ethos and staff development would encourage clinical dental tutors to utilise a coaching approach in their written feedback. Across two time-points, written feedback was categorised into either descriptive, evaluative or coaching approaches. Cross-sections of data from 2017 to 2019 were examined to determine whether changes in practice were noted and whether there were any alterations in the affective nature of the language used. Feedback moved significantly towards coaching and away from a descriptive approach. A shift towards the use of more positive language was seen overall, although this was solely driven by a change in the evaluative feedback category. Descriptive feedback generally used neutral language with coaching feedback using marginally more positive language. Both categories employed significantly lower levels of affective language than evaluative feedback. These data indicate a move towards feedback approaches and language that may support increased uptake and utilisation of feedback#FRE#
