#ITI#Understanding High Quality Teacher-Student Interactions in High Needs Elementary Schools: An Exploration of Teacher, Student, and Relational Contributors#FTI#
#IRE#Research consistently demonstrates that high quality teacher-student interactions have meaningful links to students’ learning, development, and mental health (Choi et al., Early Education and Development, 30(3):337–356, 2019; Mashburn et al., Child Development 79:732–749, 2008; McLean and Connor, Child Development 86:945–954, 2015). However, little is known about the factors that contribute to quality teacher-student interactions (Early et al., 2007). These interactions are dynamic; therefore, they are likely influenced by teacher characteristics, student characteristics, and dyadic relational elements. In 330 third- and fourth-grade classrooms across 60 high needs elementary schools, we aimed to better understand how teacher burnout, student aggression, and teacher-student relational closeness explained variation in observed classroom interaction quality (i.e., emotional support, instructional support, and classroom organization) later in the year, controlling for earlier observations. Importantly, student aggression and teacher-student relational closeness were measured from both teacher and student perspectives. While teacher burnout earlier in the year was not significantly associated with changes in interaction quality across the year, the results highlighted the importance of student behavior and relational factors. Specifically, more teacher-reported classroom-level aggression was associated with less emotional support and classroom organization across the year. Additionally, greater student-reported teacher-student relational closeness was linked to increased emotional support, instructional support, and classroom organization. These results indicate that fostering close teacher-student relationships may contribute to improved classroom interaction quality. Practical implications for teachers, instructional coaches, and school psychologists are discussed#FRE#
