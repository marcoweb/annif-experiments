#ITI#A Pilot Study Exploring the Feasibility and Acceptability of Digitally Mediated Team Communication in Primary Schools#FTI#
#IRE#With high demand on specialist child mental health services internationally, there is significant interest in prevention and early intervention, as well as innovative and efficient approaches for increasing access to high-quality care. Digital communication technologies can improve communication between different professionals and agencies involved in young people’s lives, which is especially important in rural locations and became more necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study examined the perceived value, feasibility, and acceptability of digitally mediated team communication for responding to emerging social, emotional, and mental health support needs in primary school settings in a rural county in the UK. A pre-/post-study design was used as a process evaluation of digitally mediated team communication and pilot test of feasibility and perceived value. Fifteen individual children (aged 4–9 years) were referred to a digitally mediated multidisciplinary team (with representation from relevant children’s services) where formulation was used to develop specialised action plans implemented by education staff and parents/carers. Findings suggest that digitally mediated team communication was highly valued for enhancing practice in supporting individual children by education staff and for making progress towards personalised goals by both education staff and parents/carers. Analysis further suggests that digitally mediated team communication was feasible and acceptable to education staff and parents/carers. A digitally mediated model for an early and multidisciplinary team response holds promise for empowering education staff as an extended mental health workforce, with a need for future research with larger samples to investigate service efficiency and outcomes of this health service delivery model. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
