#ITI#University freshmen recollect their academic integrity literacy experience during their K-12 years: results of an empirical study#FTI#
#IRE#Academic Integrity Literacy (AIL) is a critical transdisciplinary skill for academic success but many students do not receive this skill in their K-12 years regardless of their schooling system or characteristics of the community they belong to. Numerous research studies in higher education document that high school graduates lack AIL skills, but hardly any studies attempt to empirically investigate students’ K-12 years AIL education experience. Using a mixed-method approach, this study explores university freshmen’s AIL education experience in their K-12 years, and their opinions on the appropriate grade level to introduce AIL education. Of the university freshmen surveyed (n = 431), roughly 1 in 10 received AIL education in middle school and 1 in 5 during high school. The survey of students’ current university instructors indicates a handful of freshmen have a fair understanding of academic integrity and plagiarism but their combined AIL application capacity, such as adhering to a referencing style and the quality of in-text source attributions in academic writing, is limited. The study results and professional experience allow the author to suggest rigorous AIL instruction and policy development for K-12 institutions to educate, empower and execute AIL education#FRE#
