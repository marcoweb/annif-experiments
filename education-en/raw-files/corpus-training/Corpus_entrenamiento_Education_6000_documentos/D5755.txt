#ITI#Posthuman pedagogy: experiential education for an era of mutualism#FTI#
#IRE#Wildlife-human relations in the United States are predominantly influenced by Euro-American sociocultural dynamics and (neo)colonial legacies. Humans dominate nonhuman animals through violence, suffering, and death. Wildlife management as a practice is becoming increasingly criticized. Disagreement emerges from epistemological and ontological foundations and remains contentious in theory and practice. Environmental education reinforces the subjugation of nonhumans and particular individuals that are governed by human decision-making, and power assemblages. However, public values have shifted to a mutualism orientation where management practices are challenged by shifting moral standards of society that value the intrinsic rights, welfare, and agency of individual beings. We present two related case studies that showcase posthuman pedagogy and illustrate how ‘real-world’ field experiences can shape students’ ontologies and cosmologies. This work draws from the first author’s fieldwork on salmon-sea lion-human relations in the Columbia River Basin of the Pacific Northwest US. This includes over 120 semi-structured interviews, two deployments of the Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) model, participant observation, and archival data. We focus on four specific fieldwork moments captured by student reflection. Posthuman pedagogy allows educators and scholars to rest with the material relations that dictate the lives of nonhuman participants and provides pragmatic openings for more-than-human worlds#FRE#
