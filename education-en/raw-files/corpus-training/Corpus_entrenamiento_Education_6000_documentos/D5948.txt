#ITI#ChatGPT is a game changer: detection and eradication is not the way forward#FTI#
#IRE#Large language models such as ChatGPT can be seen as a major threat to reliable assessment in higher education. In this point of departure, I argue that these tools are a major game changer for society at large. Many of the jobs we now consider highly skilled are based on pattern recognition that can much more reliably be carried by fine-tuned language models. We are therefore at a turning point in history and it affords a powerful opportunity to reconsider the value of higher education in the light of these tools#FRE#
