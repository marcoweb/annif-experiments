#ITI#Organisational impact on the use of restrictive measures: The perspective of Swedish front-line managers#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Restrictive measures (RM) are prevalent in services for people with intellectual disabilities. This study investigates managerial awareness of RM and the nature of organisational supports required to reduce their use. Method: A survey asked front-line managers and staff what (RM) were used, their purpose, impact and importance (10-item Likert scales) and what organisational changes were required (free text). Responses were analysed using descriptive methods and content analysis. Results: Managers reported a lower use of RM, compared with staff. According to managers, RM were mainly used to keep service users from harm, their use having a significant impact. Opportunities to change practices were limited by a lack of resources and organisational support. Conclusion: Front-line managers seem to lack the capacity to address the use of RM due to organisational drift; limited manager time and opportunity to allocate resources; inadequate environments; and lack of skilled staff, knowledge and relevant professional input#FRE#
