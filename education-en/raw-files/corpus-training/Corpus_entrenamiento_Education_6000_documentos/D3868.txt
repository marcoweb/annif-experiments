#ITI#Families, Language, and Equal Opportunities: Identifying Good Practices in Family Literacy Projects#FTI#
#IRE#It has long been known that children who grow up in situations of economic and social disadvantage tend to have more difficulties when they enter school, and that these are often perpetuated, leading to underachievement and disaffection. The role of the family and home environment in stimulating children’s language acquisition and pre-literacy competences during their earliest years is clearly important. It is possible that with appropriate exposure and encouragement before the age of 3, children from disadvantaged backgrounds could start school on an equal footing with their more privileged counterparts. We provide a conceptual overview of the factors in the home affecting language and subsequent literacy development in children aged 0–3, and a review of programs designed to enhance the home learning environment. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
