#ITI#Improving learning environments through whole-school collaborative action research#FTI#
#IRE#The focus of professional learning on activities has changed to internal growth or change among teachers. Our 3-year whole-school collaborative action research was based on student feedback from a learning environment survey at a secondary school. Quantitative data were obtained by administering a survey in 2012, 2013 and 2014 to 2673 students in 171 classes to assess perceptions of the learning environment. Qualitative information, involving classroom observations and interviews with the principal and professional development coordinator, illuminated how the school incorporated this collaborative action research approach. Statistically-significant differences for numerous aspects of the learning environment were found between the 2012, 2013 and 2014 student groups#FRE#
