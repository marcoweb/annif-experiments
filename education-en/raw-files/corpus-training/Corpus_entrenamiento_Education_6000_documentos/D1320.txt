#ITI#Institutional, program, and professional community: a framework for online higher education#FTI#
#IRE# This paper reviews theories regarding online learning communities in higher education and their relevance to online degree programs. While these theories are used extensively to promote and maintain community within online courses, little attention has been placed on broader factors that can influence perceptions of online community. Based on our research as well as an extensive review of the literature, this paper articulates limitations in current research and posits a framework to look at institutional, program, and professional layers. The framework also considers community salience from these layers at various points in a learner’s program. Based on the layers presented, the framework proposes that true communities are shaped by myriad partners and that these partnerships should not be ignored in community research. Furthermore, it admonishes educators to provide guidance to learners regarding the purposes of community formation both during and beyond program completion. Lastly, the paper articulates needs for further research as online degree programs consider community development and maintenance through more holistic approaches#FRE#
