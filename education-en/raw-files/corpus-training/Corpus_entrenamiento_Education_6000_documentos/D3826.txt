#ITI#Coaching Parents to Support Oral Language Skills During Shared Reading#FTI#
#IRE#Dialogic reading is a shared reading intervention which has been shown to increase children's oral language skills. Although dialogic reading has been heavily researched and replicated with a variety of populations, this study uniquely focused on outcomes when parents of children with a developmental delay from low socioeconomic status homes were coached to implement dialogic reading with their child in their home. Using a multiple probe design across three parent–child dyads, researchers examined the effects of the modified dialogic reading intervention package on participating parents and their children. When provided with evidence-based training and coaching sessions, all parents were able to implement the intervention with fidelity and increased the number of open-ended prompts and expansions they used with their child during shared reading. Two of the three children's oral language skills appeared to improve throughout the course of the study preparing them for future success in their literacy development#FRE#
