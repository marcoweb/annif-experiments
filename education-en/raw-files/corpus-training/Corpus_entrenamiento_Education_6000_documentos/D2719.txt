#ITI#Exploration of the characteristics of teachers' multimodal behaviours in problem-oriented teaching activities with different response levels#FTI#
#IRE# Problem-oriented teaching (POT) activities are important in classroom instruction. The level of student response can be influenced by different teacher behaviours in POT. However, the characteristics of teachers' multimodal behaviours at different levels of response are unclear. This study applied epistemic network analysis to explore the characteristics of teachers' multimodal behaviours in POT with different response levels. Using 256 POT segments from 12 classroom teaching videos in primary and secondary schools, this study found that authentic questions and iconic gestures occupied a central position in multimodal behaviours. The concomitant use of multimodal behaviours and the flexibility in eye contact could improve the response levels of students. These findings help understand how teachers' multimodal behaviours can promote students' responses. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Various behaviours have been shown to impact learners' response, such as teachers' responses to students and teachers' non-verbal behaviours. Epistemic network analysis can be used to analyse the structure of the connections between cognitive, social and interaction data. What this paper adds This study analyses the characteristics of teachers' multimodal behaviours during problem-oriented activities. It also compares the salient properties of non-verbal, verbal and multimodal behavioural networks generated by interactive fragments of students' responses of different cognitive levels. Implications for practice and policy Teachers should ask more authentic questions in the classroom to promote in-depth thinking processes in students. The appropriate coordination of multimodal behaviours by teachers is crucial to promote the cognitive level of students' responses. Upon making eye contact with students, teachers should also use iconic gestures and be flexible regarding the use of eye contact#FRE#
