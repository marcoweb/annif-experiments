#ITI#Deconstructing EdTech frameworks based on their creators, features, and usefulness#FTI#
#IRE# Several theoretical frameworks have been released in recent years to inform how educational technology (edtech) can be used in the classroom. These frameworks range from providing a holistic view of the role edtech plays in education at a macrolevel to analyzing how edtech is used by students and teachers. With a growing number of them now available, researchers have yet to systemically collect and analyze a set of these frameworks, which can result in edtech not being used effectively by practitioners and researchers alike. In response, this study employed a content analysis methodology to analyze nine frameworks designed for using edtech. This study will report its findings regarding the creators of these frameworks, features used to draw attention to the frameworks, and which frameworks key stakeholders may find most useful. To conclude, implications for contextualizing these frameworks within the EdTech Ecosystem will be offered along with critical considerations for practitioners and researchers to use when selecting edtech frameworks for their work#FRE#
