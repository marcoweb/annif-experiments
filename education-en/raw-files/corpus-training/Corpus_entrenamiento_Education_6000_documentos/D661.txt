#ITI#Applied learning and student views of social and political involvement#FTI#
#IRE# While levels of civic engagement among undergraduate students in the United States have increased, understanding how applied learning experiences might facilitate or hinder promotion of civic attitudes, or personal importance of social and political involvement, can provide insights for both faculty and student affairs practitioners. Using longitudinal data from the Wabash National Study of Liberal Arts Education in the United States, this analysis examined the relationship between undergraduate participation in forms of applied learning and students’ fourth-year attitudes toward the importance of social and political involvement. Results suggested that participating in out-of-class experiences which applied classroom learning, volunteer opportunities, completion of a community project, and study abroad were all positively associated with higher levels of the importance students placed on their social and political involvement#FRE#
