#ITI#Fostering the growth of TPACK among international teachers of developing nations through a cultural exchange program#FTI#
#IRE#This study investigated the impact of a semester-long technology course as part of a higher education cultural exchange program for secondary school teachers of developing nations. We integrated quantitative data from surveys that evaluated participants' technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK), with qualitative evidence from participants' technology-based lesson designs. Analysis across the 16 participants indicated that the course was effective in improving teachers' TPACK. Teachers reported increases in all TPACK domains, with the largest growth in technological content knowledge and TPACK. However, qualitative analysis suggested greater presence of technological pedagogical knowledge. Teachers learned to consider affordances of technology in accordance with content or pedagogy, but their ability was limited due to resource constraints or students' readiness. Results suggest that international exchange programs are a valuable way to support teachers of developing nations in building educational technology capacity at their home schools#FRE#
