#ITI#Doctoral Degree Attainment From Ronald E. McNair Scholars Program Alumni: An Explanatory Embedded Case Study#FTI#
#IRE# Due to structural inequity, White students, those whose parents attained a university degree, and those from upper/middle class households are more likely to attain a doctoral degree. One federal program, the Ronald E. McNair Post-baccalaureate Achievement Program, provides undergraduates with academic and financial support to help marginalized students enroll and succeed in graduate school. However, little research has examined how this program has helped students attain the ultimate goal of a PhD. In this explanatory, embedded case study, 12 participants described how the program provided financial, academic, and social supports from peers, faculty, and staff during their doctoral programs.#FRE#
