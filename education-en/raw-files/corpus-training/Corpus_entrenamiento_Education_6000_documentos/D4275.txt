#ITI#Teacher critical reflection: what can be learned from quality research?#FTI#
#IRE#This Meta-Aggregative (MA) Qualitative Evidence Synthesis (QES) identified, investigated, and critically appraised examples of ‘quality’ Teacher Critical Reflection (TCR) in recent peer-reviewed research. The key question guiding the synthesis of literature was, How is teacher critical reflection evidenced, justified, and communicated in peer-reviewed research? The synthesis detected the importance of TCR in supporting quality teacher practice in early childhood and primary school settings. The MA element guided the choice of articles and the QES identified evidence of the intricacies of teacher critical reflection. The MA QES provides insights into sustainable and purposeful TCR. Thirteen studies conducted between 2013 and 2019 met the requirements of a four-phased MA QES and were critically appraised to inform the synthesis. Recommendations derived from this review include the importance of identifying the objectives of TCR, TCR as part of teacher identity and its impact on TCR, the significant role that social collaboration plays in TCR, and the tools that support successful TCR. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
