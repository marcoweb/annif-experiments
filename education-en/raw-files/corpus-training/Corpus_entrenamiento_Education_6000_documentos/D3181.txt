#ITI#Drone Club: Exploring Engineering and Employability Skills Outside the Classroom#FTI#
#IRE#The primary focus of our project is to create STEM-based learning opportunities for secondary students (grades 6–12) through the out-of-school space that aligns with the workforce needs of two critical STEM-related sectors: National Security and Defense, and Advanced. Manufacturing (ROI, 2017). In this learning environment, students will encounter technology tools not typically found in a traditional secondary classroom, experience various high-demand career pathways within these fields, and practice transferable skills employers are looking for from these students when entering the workforce. The STEM-based club we will use as a means of crafting these learning experiences tied to this sector will be a Drone Club. Students will learn to design, build, program, and fly drone devices. The activities included in the learning modules will incorporate skills and content tied to engineering, computer science, math, and employability skills academic standards, all of which will relate to a wide variety of STEM-related career pathways#FRE#
