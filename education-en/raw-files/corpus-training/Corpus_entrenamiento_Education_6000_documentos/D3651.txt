#IRE#Use of educational technology has escalated in recent times. This study surveyed teachers in the business school of a Canadian university after it quickly pivoted to online delivery of all classes after the initial jolt of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of the survey was to investigate the antecedents of the teachers’ intention to use educational technology in the post-pandemic period. Consistent with the theory of reasoned action (TRA), attitude and subjective norm are both positively associated with respondents’ behavioural intention to use educational technology within the two years following the pandemic. The subjective norm construct positively influences respondents’ perceptions of the usefulness of the technology, indicating that respondents are influenced by their co-workers’ opinions and the communications transmitted by the institution. Technological complexity and perceived usefulness of the technology respectively negatively and positively impact attitude, indicating that teachers perform an internal cost-benefit analysis when contemplating using educational technology. Technological complexity can also be considered an opportunity cost as it negatively impacts perceived usefulness. Lastly, facilitating conditions negatively impact technological complexity, indicating that supportive resources are important. These results should be of interest to university policymakers seeking to increase the use of educational technology#FRE#
