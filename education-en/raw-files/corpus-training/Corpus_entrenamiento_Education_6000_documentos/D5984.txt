#ITI#Co-teaching difficult subjects: critical autoethnography and pedagogy#FTI#
#IRE#Building on existing studies on co-teaching and teaching difficult subjects, this article examines the development of our co-teaching relationship, as educators with marginalized identities, teaching on difficult subjects in a graduate critical consciousness course. The authors used the theoretical and methodological intersection of critical performance pedagogy and critical autoethnography to examine and situate their experiences in co-teaching. Three pedagogical practices were identified in co-teaching difficult subjects that included: 1) the negotiation of individual and collective space, 2) the navigation of voice between collaboration and personal expression, and 3) and the role of affect in the classroom environment. The study contributes to an emerging discussion on what it means to transform teaching in higher education around difficult subjects. By focusing on co-teaching, this article sets the stage to reimagine graduate teaching as a collaborative process between more than one instructor and students with a focus on power, privilege, oppression, and social change#FRE#
