#ITI#Immediate Changes, Trade-Offs, and Fade-Out in High-Quality Teacher Practices During Coaching#FTI#
#IRE# Coaching is an increasingly used professional development approach involving ongoing, individualized teacher-coach exchanges hypothesized to drive immediate changes in teachers’ practices with students. Examining this hypothesis, the present study quantifies marginal changes after individual coaching cycles in a set of commonly considered, high-quality teacher practices using a teacher fixed effects approach. It draws on panel data from 169 early childhood educators participating in a 9-month coaching intervention using the MyTeachingPartner approach intended to improve practices outlined in the Teaching Through Interactions framework. Results indicated that emotional support and classroom organization practices improved immediately after any coaching cycle, whereas others, like instructional support and literacy focus practices, only changed after cycles focused on those specific practices. Some immediate postcycle differences in practices endured over time, whereas others dissipated quickly#FRE#
