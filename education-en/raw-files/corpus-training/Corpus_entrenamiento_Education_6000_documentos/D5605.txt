#ITI#Examining classification accuracy for expressive language skills of children with autism spectrum disorder according to object play and imitation scores#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this study was to examine classification accuracy for the expressive language skills of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in terms of object play and imitation scores. A total of 61 children with ASD, who were 2.0–5.11 years old, were included in the study. In order to collect data play and imitation assessment tasks which were adapted from the literature were implemented and parents filled the demographical information form as well as the Turkish Communicative Development Inventory. As a result of the study, there was a significant difference between the object play and imitation scores of children with ASD who had and did not have expressive language skills. This significant difference was confirmed by the classification accuracy which was conducted to predict whether children with ASD had expressive language skills or not. Object play and imitation scores classified children with ASD with an accuracy level of 75.4% in terms of whether or not being verbal, and the effect of object play score was higher in this classification process than imitation score#FRE#
