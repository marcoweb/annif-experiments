#ITI#Developing a Tool to Capture Productive and Unproductive Mindsets About Teaching Mathematics to African American Students: An Initial Review#FTI#
#IRE# In this article, we describe the development of a survey intended to assess teachers’ perceptions on teaching mathematics to African American students. Research on productive and unproductive mindsets that affect teachers’ ways of being in the classroom guided the design of the survey. We share results from three-survey administrations with two cohorts of teachers participating in a professional learning initiative designed to address historic and systemic inequities in the experiences and opportunities of African American students in mathematics classrooms, schools, and society more broadly. We discuss how the survey results can inform professional learning opportunities for mathematics teachers.#FRE#
