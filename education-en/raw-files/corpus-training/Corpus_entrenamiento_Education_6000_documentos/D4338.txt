#ITI#The adoption of social media applications for teaching purposes in higher education#FTI#
#IRE#Statistics indicated that social media applications are not being utilised by many faculties for teaching purposes. The purpose of this study was to investigate factors that influence the adoption of social media applications for teaching purposes in higher education and present the current status of this adoption. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was used to guide this investigation. Finding indicated that 58% of faculty members use social media applications in their teaching, while 41% of them had not yet done so. The path analysis results indicated that behaviour intention was a strong predictor of the integration of social media applications in the teaching process, and faculty’s attitudes were the only predictor for behaviour intention. A number of implications and recommendations for future research based on the results are presented#FRE#
