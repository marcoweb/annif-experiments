#ITI#Pre-class learning analytics in flipped classroom: Focusing on resource management strategy, procrastination and repetitive learning#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Despite the many advantages of flipped learning, it is challenging for educators to ensure that students complete the pre-class learning assignments before the in-class session. Objectives: Using a learning analytics approach, this study analysed students' pre-class video-watching behaviour in flipped learning with a focus on learners' resource management strategies, procrastination, and repeated video-watching. Methods: For the empirical study, three types of data (i.e., log data, survey and exam) were obtained from 70 undergraduate students who were enrolled in pre-service teacher program designed in a flipped classroom including pre-class videos and in-class session. Results and conclusions: The findings showed significant differences between the non-procrastination group and procrastination group in their video watching time and resource management strategies. Those who watched the pre-class videos at home/dorm greatly outnumbered those who did not, and they performed better than students who watched the pre-class videos in other locations. What are the major takeaways from the study?: This finding highlights the importance of resource management strategies in terms of the time and study environment to promote success in flipped learning courses. However, the number of times students accessed the pre-class videos or watched the videos before class was not correlated with learning achievement. The reason for re-watching pre-class videos is a suggested future direction so instructors can design effective flipped learning courses#FRE#
