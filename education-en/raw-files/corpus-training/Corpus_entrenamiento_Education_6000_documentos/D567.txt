#ITI#Examining the Academic Advising Experiences of Black Males at an Urban University: An Exploratory Case Study#FTI#
#IRE# To ensure the effectiveness of academic advising efforts on campus and to increase Black male collegians’ use of such services, administrators must better understand how Black males experience academic advising in college. This exploratory qualitative case study aims to understand the academic advising experiences of Black males at a large urban, predominantly White institution. Participants in this study (a) experienced a number of process-related challenges, including difficulties with scheduling advising appointments and accessing their academic advisor; (b) stressed the role of race and culture in academic advising; and (c) highlighted positive outcomes of formal and informal advising. Implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed.#FRE#
