#ITI#Predictive relationship between gender, ethnicity, science self-efficacy, teacher interpersonal behaviors, and science achievement of students in a diverse urban high school#FTI#
#IRE#We examined the predictive relationship between high school students’ gender, ethnicity, science self-efficacy as measured by the Science Self-Efficacy Questionnaire composite score, teacher interpersonal behaviors (TIP) as measured by the Questionnaire on Teacher Interaction (QTI) scale scores, and science grade point average in an urban Title I school in the United States using hierarchical multiple regression. The overall model was statistically significant. Individually, a statistically-significant relationship was found between students’ gender, science self-efficacy, and science GPAs, as well as a between the teacher interpersonal behavior subscales of student responsibility/freedom and uncertainty. Previous literature supports the current findings that demonstrate a predictive relationship between gender, self-efficacy, and student achievement. However, current findings deviate from previous literature that has demonstrated a predictive relationship between students’ perceptions of TIP and science achievement. The contribution of the current study to the existing research literature is discussed together with the conceptual basis that supports the predictive relationship of gender, ethnicity, science self-efficacy, the dimensions of TIP, and the subscales of TIP on students’ GPAs. In light of the findings, implications for practice and the need for further investigation are discussed#FRE#
