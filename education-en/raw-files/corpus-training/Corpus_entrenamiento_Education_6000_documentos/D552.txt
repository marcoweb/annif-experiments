#ITI#Whitewashedness in Teacher Education: Intertextuality Between Colorblindness and the Ferguson Event#FTI#
#IRE# Whitewashedness has been trickling down in language classrooms through assimilation and colorblind practices. These practices have irreversible effects on the psyche of immigrant and refugee learners in K-12 schools. This research study investigates 15 teacher candidates’ ideologies regarding colorblindness by empowering them to create intertextual links to Ferguson event, which happened in close proximity to where they teach. The study revealed how colorblindness perpetuated among the teacher candidates when they were in schools as students, how they were empowered to unpack the meaning of colorblindness, and how the White males in the program resisted to acknowledge White privileges and colorblindness.#FRE#
