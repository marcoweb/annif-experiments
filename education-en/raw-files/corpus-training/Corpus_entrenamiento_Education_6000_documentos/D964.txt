#ITI#Using Extended Reality Technology in Traditional and Place-Based Environments to Study Climate Change#FTI#
#IRE# This exploratory study uses epistemic network analysis (ENA) to examine the use of extended reality (XR) technologies embedded in post-secondary classes, one in a traditional setting and the other a place-based setting, to examine climate change while utilizing a socioscientific issues (SSI) approach. One group used a virtual reality (VR) application on their smartphones in a traditional class setting to explore four different locations on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, USA (OBX). A second group used an augmented reality (AR) application on their smartphones while visiting the same four locations. Qualitative data was collected after each experience. Analysis of each group’s networks indicated that both forms of technology engaged students in the SSI and were beneficial to their learning. However, differences in the networks revealed that virtual reality students made stronger connections between the technology, the physical impacts of climate change, and the political/socioeconomic aspects of climate change. In contrast, the augmented reality students made stronger connections between the technology and learning in general. Implications for practice and future research will be discussed.#FRE#
