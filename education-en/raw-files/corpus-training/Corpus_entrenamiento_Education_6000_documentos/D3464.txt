#ITI#A systematic review of photovoice research methods with people with intellectual disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Photovoice is an arts-based participatory action research methodology that is growing in popularity. Our aim was to systematically review photovoice research with people with intellectual disabilities to describe the current ‘state of the art’ and identify areas for further methodological consideration. Methods: We searched five databases using search terms relating to photovoice and intellectual disabilities. Thirty one studies met inclusion criteria. We used thematic analysis to identify common themes. Findings: The themes identified—adaptations to the photovoice method, collaboration, participation and power, impact and outcomes—explored how far the ‘voice’ and agency of participants with intellectual disabilities taking part in photovoice research were supported and whether photovoice lived up to its promise as ‘action’ research. Conclusion: Photovoice creates opportunities for self-representation of people with intellectual disabilities through photography. Participants could be further supported to engage with researchers in critical reflection on findings and collaborate on tangible outcomes#FRE#
