#ITI#Sharpening Justice Through DisCrit: A Contrapuntal Analysis of Education#FTI#
#IRE# Calls for justice-centered education approaches have gained traction over the years. Yet given the entrenched inequities that disproportionately harm multiply-marginalized students of color, it is evident that they remain incomplete. Using a specific incident as our launching point, we explore current conceptualizations of justice through a disability critical race theory (DisCrit) contrapuntal reading of four prolific intellectuals whose work is often not in conversation: Nancy Fraser, Iris Marion Young, Mia Mingus, and Talia Lewis. We query, (a) How does the author conceptualize justice? (b) How does the author consider difference in relationships to justice? and (c) How does the author (re)imagine potential ways to remedy injustice? By recognizing connectedness and maintaining tensions framed within DisCrit, this article enumerates expansive conceptualizations of justice through centering multiply-marginalized communities of color#FRE#
