#ITI#Paths of Justification in Israeli 7th Grade Mathematics Textbooks#FTI#
#IRE#When justifying a mathematical statement, textbooks often interweave several instances of justification, creating, what we term, paths of justification. This study aims to characterize the paths of justification of mathematical statements that are offered in eight 7th grade Israeli mathematics textbooks. The study attended to context and compared paths of justification in different mathematical domains (algebra and geometry) and in textbooks intended for students with different achievement levels. Analysis focused on the number of instances of justification in a path, the types of justification of those instances, and their order. Comparing paths of justification between algebra and geometry, and between textbooks intended for students with different levels of achievements, revealed several similarities and differences. The findings portray a complex picture of textbook justifications, underlining the need to be sensitive to context when studying textbook justifications. The study results are discussed in light of relevant literature, highlighting potential factors involved in the way a textbook path of justification of a specific mathematical statement is structured. © National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan 2023.
