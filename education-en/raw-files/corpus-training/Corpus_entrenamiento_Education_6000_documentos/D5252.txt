#ITI#Introduction of Integrated STEM Education to Pre-service Teachers Through Collaborative Action Research Practices#FTI#
#IRE#Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is the leading education reform worldwide, yet many teachers need more knowledge and confidence to teach integrated STEM. This study examines the initiative of teaching a STEM-integrated approach through the collaboration of mathematics and science university lecturers and preservice teachers in a teaching and learning subject-specific course. The study presents the preservice teachers’ knowledge development about integrating STEM into their lesson plans and their views and attitudes toward the STEM approach to teaching. Data were collected through presurveys, postsurveys, lesson plans, and presentations from 12 groups (N = 51) of preservice mathematics and chemistry teachers. Results show that these preservice teachers’ experiences with STEM learning and teaching positively impacted their understanding and importance of STEM and their motivation and enthusiasm to design and present STEM lesson plans in group settings while integrating mathematics, chemistry, and other subjects. However, the findings of this research showed that these preservice teachers needed more knowledge regarding the inclusion of formative assessment strategies in their lesson plans. Thus, more research is required to understand better how to support preservice and in-service teachers’ formative assessment practices in the context of STEM education. In summary, the finding suggests policymakers and educational institutions should advocate for additional high-quality integrated STEM courses, programs, and research to enhance and institutionalize teaching and learning of integrated STEM and, as a result, increase the number of individuals working in STEM professions while promoting a consistent vision of integrated STEM education across the school system. © National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan 2023.#FRE#
