#ITI#The Seeing Science Project: Using Design-Based Research to Develop a Transformative Experience Intervention#FTI#
#IRE# Drawing on transformative experience theory (Pugh, 2011) and in collaboration with high school science teachers, the authors developed an intervention (Seeing Science project) leveraging everyday mobile technology as a tool for integrating in-school and out-of-school experience. Students were instructed to take pictures when they noticed connections to unit content and post these with a caption on a class site. The current study used design-based research methods to revise and evaluate the Seeing Science project over a 2-year period. Revisions to the project were informed by year one data and principles of the Teaching for Transformative Experiences in Science (TTES) instructional model. Data sources included project artifacts, student interviews, and teacher interviews. Revisions to the project resulted in higher quality posts in pre-AP biology classes and greater participation in regular biology classes. Furthermore, an analysis of posts, classroom observations, and student interviews revealed that the project helped some students connect in-school learning to out-of-school experience and undergo transformative experiences. The current study contributes to transformative experience theory by identifying and developing strategies for fostering transformative experiences. These strategies further inform the TTES model and may support depth of learning and career identification#FRE#
