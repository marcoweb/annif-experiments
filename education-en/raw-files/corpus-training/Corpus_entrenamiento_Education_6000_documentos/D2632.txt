#ITI#How do students' self-regulation skills affect learning satisfaction and continuous intention within desktop-based virtual reality? A structural equation modelling approach#FTI#
#IRE# Virtual reality, as an excellent supportive instructional technology, has gained increasing attention from educators and professionals, where desktop-based virtual reality (DVR) is broadly adopted due to its affordability and accessibility. However, when evaluating students' learning experiences such as flow experiences in DVR environments, most studies adopt a single construct (the total score of flow experience) rather than multiple constructs (enjoyment, engagement, concentration, presence and time distortion). This study implemented desktop-based virtual reality for a STEM bridge designing program with a total of 254 undergraduates to investigate the relationship between self-regulation skills, five dimensions of flow experience, learning satisfaction and continuous intention when engaging in a DVR learning environment. The results revealed that self-regulated learning exerted a dominant impact on students' learning attitudes in DVR learning, in which students' flow experience had a significant mediating effect. Notably, although DVR exhibited poor time distortion, higher satisfaction and continuous intention were still predicted by the mentality of flow experience (ie, enjoyment, engagement, concentration and presence). The findings of this study contribute to the consideration of learning experiences and attitudes, which has insights for the future design of desktop-based virtual reality environments and related instructional activities. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicStudents are different in self-regulation skills, which influences their satisfaction and continuous intention in learning.Students' self-regulation skills are one of the important variables in predicting their flow experience.A high level of flow experience contributes to a coherent and efficient learning experience within desktop-based virtual reality (DVR) environments.What this paper addsStudents' self-regulation skills positively predicted their flow experience and satisfaction in DVR environments.The components of flow experience (enjoyment, concentration and presence) partially mediated the relationship between self-regulation skills and satisfaction.Students' self-regulation skills indirectly affect continuous intention by the enjoyment and engagement of flow experiences.Implications for practice and/or policyWhen delivering DVR-based learning activities educators should be supportive of students with low levels of self-regulation skills.Emphasis on promoting flow experiences such as enjoyment, engagement, concentration and presence in designing a DVR-based classroom could enhance student satisfaction and continuous intention.Embedding scaffolding or feedback in DVR settings would support self-regulated learning and subsequently improve student satisfaction and persistence through enhanced flow experience#FRE#
