#ITI#Speaking Our Imaginings Into Existence: Poetry as a Contestation of Black Erasure in Academia#FTI#
#IRE#Black matters, according to Black feminist geographer Katherine McKittrick (2006), are always already spatial matters. As Black academics, we are intimately familiar with hostile environments and unwelcoming spaces (Dade et al., 2015; Griffin, 2013; Misawa, 2015).Embracing the sacred principle of nommo, which is to conjure images of biological and spiritual existence (Walker & Kuykendall, 2005), we envision poetry as a contestation of Black absenting and a platform to speak our imaginings into existence. This duoethnography, by a Black woman postdoctoral scholar and a Black man navigating academia as a current faculty member, draws on endarkened feminist epistemology as a conceptual framework to guide articulations of self in and against academic spaces that attempt to marginalize, silence, and erase Black personhood#FRE#
