#ITI#Knowledge Systems Design (KSD): Rebranding the Field of Instructional Technology in the Education and Professional Development Community#FTI#
#IRE#A name for the field of instructional technology has long been debated. Terms such as learning design, educational technology, instructional systems design and learning systems have been used to describe the field over the past 100 years. With an exploration of the history of the field, this article rebrands the field as Knowledge Systems Design (KSD). Whether it is a knowledge of skills or concepts, knowledge is the end goal of all instruction. Systems are the processes through which knowledge is transferred to the learner. The learning processes necessary for knowledge creation must be carefully designed. Together, these three terms provide a description for an ever-changing field that transcends time and fully encompasses the transfer of knowledge in any setting#FRE#
