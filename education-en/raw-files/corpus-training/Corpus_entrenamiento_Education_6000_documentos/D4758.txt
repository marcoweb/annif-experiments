#ITI#Person, context and judgement: Exploring the potential of a theoretical model describing the role of information and communication technology in the doctoral research process#FTI#
#IRE#This paper presents an early exploration of the utility of a theoretical model of internal and external factors that influence and determine relationships between doctoral researchers and information and communication technologies (ICTs). We discuss feedback gathered from three iterations of a voluntary, online, open programme called 23 Things International to illustrate how the components of the model emerge through participants’ reported experiences of the programme; a key is understanding how context-dependent uptake of specific ICTs can be closely connected to whether participants can relate materials directly to their own situation. Although further investigation of the model is warranted, there are indications that it will be useful for guiding not only improvements to future iterations of 23 Things International, but also for designing, developing and implementing learning environments that meet the needs of participants from a variety of (doctoral research) settings. It will also help those responsible for providing such support to understand the varied responses doctoral researchers may have to professional development programmes and support. Implications for practice or policy • The model provides insights into factors that influence and determine learner response to incorporating ICTs within doctoral research processes. • Examples and discussion of learner responses to doctoral research ICT-focused professional development programmes are useful to course designers. • Course design should enable learners to translate ideas into meaningful thinking and practice within their own research contexts. • Improvement to the model's applicability requires systematic analysis of its components using a relevant test base (i.e., 23 Things International). © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).
