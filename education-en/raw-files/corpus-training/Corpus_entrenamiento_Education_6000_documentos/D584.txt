#ITI#An Inquiry into Home Visits as a Practice of Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy in Urban Schools#FTI#
#IRE# Family-school partnerships are considered essential to the success of multiply marginalized children in urban contexts. These partnerships often, however, reinforce middle-class white normativity and subsequent oppression of families outside the dominant culture. Home visiting is one such practice spreading throughout urban centers. Is it possible for home visits to be culturally sustaining instead of perpetuating an oppressive status quo? Using qualitative participant-observation research methods, we examine what takes place during home visits at two urban elementary schools. We analyze the extent to which these home visits align with principles of culturally sustaining pedagogy. Recommendations for improving home visits are provided.#FRE#
