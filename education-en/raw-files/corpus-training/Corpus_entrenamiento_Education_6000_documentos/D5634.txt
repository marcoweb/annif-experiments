#ITI#Special education teachers: the role of problem-solving coping strategies in the relationship between thinking styles and distance education attitudes#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of problem-solving coping strategies in the relationship between thinking styles (legislative, executive, and judicial) and teachers’ attitudes towards distance education (difficulties related to distance education and efficacy in distance education). The study sample consisted of 556 special education teachers, 122 males (21.9%) and 434 females (78.1%), with an average age of 37.90 years (SD = 7.12). The results confirmed the role of problem-solving coping as a mediator for legislative thinking style on difficulties related to distance education. Furthermore, the findings indicated a positive relationship between judicial style and efficacy in distance education. The results of this study highlight the importance of developing specific special education teacher trainings to promote positive attitudes towards distance education#FRE#
