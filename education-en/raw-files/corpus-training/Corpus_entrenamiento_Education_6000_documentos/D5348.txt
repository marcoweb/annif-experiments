#ITI#The Significance of Traditional Bullying, Cyberbullying, and Mental Health Problems for Middle School Students Feeling Unsafe in the School Environment#FTI#
#IRE#Feeling safe in school is important for students’ learning, well-being, and quality of life. Variables possibly associated with feeling unsafe in school, such as mental health problems, traditional bullying, cyberbullying, and various health problems, were explored. Altogether, 2,028 adolescents (M age = 14 years, 50% boys) from 72 middle schools in northern Norway were respondents. Being unsafe in school resulted from a combination of lack of care provided by the student’s teacher and not feeling safe. In all, 5.7% (115) of the students reported feeling unsafe. In the final model, not feeling safe at school was significantly associated with being traditionally bullied, being a victim of cyberbullying, mental health problems including conduct, hyperactivity and peer problems, abdominal pain, and Norwegian not being the mother tongue. Feeling unsafe at school is a potential marker of several difficulties needing attention and interventions from school leaders, teachers and school health services#FRE#
