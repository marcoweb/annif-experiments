#ITI#Braids and Bridges: A Critical Collaborative Autoethnography of Racially Minoritized Women Teaching Intergroup Dialogue#FTI#
#IRE#Intergroup dialogue (IGD) is a critical dialogic pedagogy that calls for extraordinary care and labor. So, why as women of color (WOC), who expend disproportionate emotional labor in the academy, do we teach IGD? In this collaborative critical autoethnography, we braid our individual narratives through a critical collaborative autoethnography (CAE) to address what brought us to teaching IGD, what challenges and supports us in teaching IGD, and how our identities inform how we engage with IGD. We conclude with a bridge to future scholars and educators who teach IGD, offering implications for future research and practice#FRE#
