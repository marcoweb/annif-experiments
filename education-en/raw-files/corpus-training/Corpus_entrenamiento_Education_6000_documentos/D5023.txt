#ITI#Who Enrolls in Internationalized Courses? An Exploration of At-Home Access at One Community College#FTI#
#IRE#This study adopts an equity-driven lens to focus on how international education serves to reproduce long-standing racial and economic hierarchies through a critical exploration of which students participate in two international education experiences: at-home internationalized coursework and study abroad. Drawing from student demographic data representing a U.S. Southeast community college, results suggest differences in participation along racial/ethnic lines for both international experiences, with Black students appearing to experience the most formidable barriers to participation. Results also suggest that at-home internationalized coursework increases access to international education opportunity for students from lower-income backgrounds while excluding older students#FRE#
