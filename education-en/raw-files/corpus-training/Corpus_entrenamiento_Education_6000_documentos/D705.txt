#ITI#Enhancing co-supervision practice by setting expectations in a structured discussion using a research-informed tool#FTI#
#IRE# Team or co-supervision of doctoral students has been adopted by many universities in different parts of the world. This study focuses on a key aspect of this supervision model that is both a perceived advantage and a challenge, namely the need for supervisors to work collaboratively with colleagues for the benefit of students. It argues that transparent conversations are essential in co-supervisory teams for ensuring productive working relationships. We surveyed 106 supervisors and interviewed 14 others to find out the main problems in co-supervision and what topics should form discussions at the start of a project. This study introduces a research informed conversational tool that academic developers as well as supervisors can utilise to enhance the quality of co-supervision and overall doctoral supervision satisfaction. The conversational tool incorporates three areas for a structured discussion: co-supervision arrangements, the project and pedagogies of supervision#FRE#
