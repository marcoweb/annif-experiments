#ITI#Factors and experiences that influence school mobility for autistic students: A systematic review#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Autistic students are reported to move schools at a high rate, but little is understood about why this is happening. What is known is that the effects of school mobility can negatively impact both short- and long-term outcomes, particularly the child's learning, behaviours, mental health and school retention. Aims: The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the research on factors and experiences which influence the family's decision to move their autistic child to another school. Methods: A protocol was registered with PROPERO (ID: CRD4202120794). Searches were conducted with ERIC, Scopus and Web of Science and seven studies were identified. Results: The studies focused on three main types of mobility: mainstream-to-mainstream school moves, moving between mainstream and segregated schools, and moving between mainstream and homeschool. Parents’ concerns for their child's learning, social experiences and mental health, as well as their own interactions with their child's school, influenced the decision to leave. Whilst there were similarities across the studies for reasons to move, there were also differences based upon the settings between which students moved. Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for further research across all school mobility types to better understand the reasons underpinning high rates of school mobility for autistic students#FRE#
