#ITI#Replay the game and teach for understanding: exploring the use of video tagging in an invasion games unit#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Combining Game-Based Approaches, video feedback, and debate of ideas (débat d'idées) constitutes an emerging field within pedagogical literature in Physical and Health Education. Nevertheless, more work is needed to understand how this digital tool can be effectively integrated into the teaching and learning process. Purpose: This study sought to further investigate the effective implementation of video tagging in games lessons with 14–15-year-old students. The central aim was to explore how a Game Sense Approach can be effectively integrated with video tagging and student-led debates. The secondary aim was to investigate the emergence of so-called ‘action rules’ (game plans) which emerge from these verbal exchanges. Participants and Setting: Game Sense pedagogy and video tagging were used as a stimulus for student-led debates during seven lessons. A pragmatic epistemological approach underpinned iterative cycles of action research using recordings from student-led debates critical collegial discussions, and teacher reflections to inform the implementation of the approach. A post-hoc thematic analysis of the PHE teachers’ reflections and content analysis of student debates were then conducted. Findings: The results of the action research process revealed that organisation and what to tag were key considerations in the successful implementation of the approach. The results from student interactions showed a high level of team-based positive action rules, with a low level of negative feedback. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of critically considering technology integration, the content of student interactions, and their pedagogical implications. The integration of video tagging in diverse game-based situations can provide pedagogical and organisational challenges. However, key considerations of organisation and what to tag may help PHE teacher identify appropriate learning situations to use video tagging as a stimulus for the debate of ideas#FRE#
