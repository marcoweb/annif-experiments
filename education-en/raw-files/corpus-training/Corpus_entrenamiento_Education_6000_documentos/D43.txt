#ITI#Promoting educational change in religious enclave schools: a comparison of radical and moderate Haredi activists in Israel#FTI#
#IRE# The vast majority of Haredi schools for boys in Israel focus almost exclusively on religious studies. This study explores Haredi (Jewish ultra-Orthodox) activism aimed at promoting secular education in these schools. Data collection drew on semi-structured interviews with 20 Haredi activists. The findings compared two patterns of Haredi activism—radical and moderate—and highlighted their distinguishing features: the activists’ identity, ideology, tactics, and approach towards the state. Whereas these distinctions impeded joint efforts to promote educational change, they enabled the radical activists to use contra-institutional tactics and strengthened the legitimacy of the moderate activists. In the context of religious enclave communities, different patterns of activism, based on different models of religious identity and ideology, may produce effective tailor-made solutions that are congruent with the preferences of different religious subgroups. Understanding the dynamic of Haredi activism may assist in mobilising educational rights in enclave religious communities#FRE#
