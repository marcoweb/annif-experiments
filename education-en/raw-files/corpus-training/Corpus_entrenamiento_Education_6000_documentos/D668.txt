#ITI#Social work, social justice and Americentrism by design: transnationalism in United States social work education#FTI#
#IRE# As our world moves away from historic models of self-contained countries, toward a more integrated and connected world, research suggests transnational approaches may be advantageous for advancing social justice agendas. While social work higher education has long prioritized cultural competencies and global perspectives in practice and research, it is unknown how social work educators in the United States are globalizing curricula. Syllabi from bachelor and master-level social work theory courses from twenty-five US schools of social work were examined using thematic analysis. Of the forty-one syllabi studied, eight contained no information relevant to international, global, cross-cultural or transnational theory. Of the thirty-three syllabi with relevant content, three unique themes emerged: (1) global othering, (2) population-specific studies; and (3) Americentrism. Upon examination of core syllabi, researchers argue empirically for the inclusion of global or transnational content in professional social work theory education. Mirroring the application of transnationalism in sister fields of anthropology, sociology, psychology and political science, this article provides a framework for incorporating transnational competency into social work curricula. Transnationalism captures the connections and networks that facilitate global processes despite distance. Highlighting these connections can animate social work curricula with the tools and practices for an interconnected world#FRE#
