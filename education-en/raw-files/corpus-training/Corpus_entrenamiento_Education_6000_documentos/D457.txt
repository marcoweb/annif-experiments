#ITI#Imperialistic reclamation of higher education diversity initiatives through semantic co-option and concession#FTI#
#IRE# Affirmative Action in higher education exemplifies interest convergence, and beyond this, interest divergence and imperialistic reclamation. Diversity initiatives, such as the Inclusive Excellence initiative, have adopted key strategies and reasoning developed in Affirmative Action Supreme Court cases. This paper shows how semantic concessions and co-options within Supreme Court cases and in Inclusive Excellence scholarship have moved the focus of higher education diversity programs from access for Students of Color to educational benefits for white students. I show how current diversity initiatives are based on false premises with legal precedent. I frame these semantic concessions and co-options within imperialistic reclamation and discuss the implications#FRE#
