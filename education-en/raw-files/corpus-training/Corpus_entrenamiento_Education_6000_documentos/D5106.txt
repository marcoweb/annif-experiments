#ITI#The role of English as medium of instruction in lower primary schools in a selected community in Ghana#FTI#
#IRE#This study investigates the practicalities of the instructional language policy and the role that English plays in multilingual classrooms at the lower primary level. The research aims to find answers to the following questions. First, in a multilingual lower primary classroom where some teachers and some pupils do not understand the major local language available, what language does the teacher use to teach them (instructional language)? Second, what role does English play as a medium of instruction? In total, 53 participants, made up of 14 teachers and 39 pupils sampled from three lower primary schools were involved in the research. Lessons were observed, followed by semi-structured interview sessions with both teachers and pupils. The findings indicate that the classrooms are multilingual, with the teachers using languages that they are comfortable with in teaching. It is also worth noting that Akan is becoming a predominant minority language even though it is not a prescribed instructional language for that school community. Finally, it comes to light that English is gradually taking over as the main language of instruction in the multilingual classrooms, a practice that goes contrary to the educational language policy. The study recommends translanguaging in the lower primary multilingual classrooms#FRE#
