#ITI#Bended Womanhood Bended Back: The Intersection of Race, Gender, and Culture in Women of Color Veterans and Their Transition Into Higher Education#FTI#
#IRE#Despite the increasing attention given to veterans in higher education, few studies have explored the transitional experiences of women of color student veterans (WOCSVs). This study examines the gendered and racialized experiences of WOCSVs and the impact of their intersecting identities on the transition through higher education. Considering the overlapping marginalities of the WOCSV participants, we grounded this study in the concept of Intersectionality, intrinsically aligned to Critical Race Theory. Based on the thematic analysis of 10 participants’ narratives, this study revealed four interrelated themes that characterize their transition journey: (a) suppressed and redemanded identity, (b) fighting for visibility, (c) marginalized academic identity, and (d) no belonging. The sense of no belonging is evident through the participants’ transition experiences, thus setting them apart from other groups of student veterans. However, the participants showed critical insight and resilience that evolved from their intersecting identities. In addition, they proactively constructed their own support system on and off campus, which further served as a psychological sanctuary and motivational cradle. We conclude with recommendations for institutions of higher education, including the reimagining and restructuring of the current cultural climate of veteranfriendly campuses grounded in the stereotypes of White men as the prototype of U.S. military veterans#FRE#
