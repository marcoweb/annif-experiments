#ITI#The impact of prior performance information on subsequent assessment: is there evidence of retaliation in an anonymous multisource assessment system?#FTI#
#IRE# Few studies have engaged in data-driven investigations of the presence, or frequency, of what could be considered retaliatory assessor behaviour in Multi-source Feedback (MSF) systems. In this study, authors explored how assessors scored others if, before assessing others, they received their own assessment score. The authors examined assessments from an established MSF system in which all clinical team members - medical students, interns, residents, fellows, and supervisors - anonymously assessed each other. The authors identified assessments in which an assessor (i.e., any team member providing a score to another) gave an aberrant score to another individual. An aberrant score was defined as one that was more than two standard deviations from the assessment receiver’s average score. Assessors who gave aberrant scores were categorized according to whether their behaviour was preceded by: (1) receiving a score or not from another individual in the MSF system (2) whether the score they received was aberrant or not. The authors used a multivariable logistic regression model to investigate the association between the type of score received and the type of score given by that same individual. In total, 367 unique assessors provided 6091 scores on the performance of 484 unique individuals. Aberrant scores were identified in 250 forms (4.1%). The chances of giving an aberrant score were 2.3 times higher for those who had received a score, compared to those who had not (odds ratio 2.30, 95% CI:1.54–3.44, P < 0.001). Individuals who had received an aberrant score were also 2.17 times more likely to give an aberrant score to others compared to those who had received a non-aberrant score (2.17, 95% CI:1.39–3.39, P < 0.005) after adjusting for all other variables. This study documents an association between receiving scores within an anonymous multi-source feedback (MSF) system and providing aberrant scores to team members. These findings suggest care must be given to designing MSF systems to protect against potential downstream consequences of providing and receiving anonymous feedback.#FRE#
