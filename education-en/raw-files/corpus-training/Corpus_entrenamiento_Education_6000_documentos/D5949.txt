#ITI#Performance practice as research, learning and teaching#FTI#
#IRE#This article considers how the performing arts integrate with research, learning and teaching. In doing so, it addresses the relation between research and performance practice, and the connections between research/practice with learning and teaching. Reference to A/R/Tography is made as a constructivist praxis facilitating integration of these pedagogic and creative activities. The discussion extends from performance education and how it is assessed in terms of teaching and research quality to consideration of how performance practice may be applied in diverse educational, social and professional contexts. Performance practice is shown to integrate learning and teaching in a holistic process. It also supports reflexivity as a basis for learning and cognitive development. Reference is made to specific examples of performance pedagogy and applied performance practice to demonstrate how this creative approach supports learning in educational and social contexts#FRE#
