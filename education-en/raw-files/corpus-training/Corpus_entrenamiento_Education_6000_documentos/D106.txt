#ITI#A subversive pedagogy to empower marginalised students: an Australian study#FTI#
#IRE# This paper draws on Bernstein’s educational sociology to illustrate how a language-focused “subversive” pedagogic approach (Martin, 2011) was systematically realised through classroom interactions. While educational inequalities are often addressed at the level of policy and budgets, this paper provides a perspective on inequality and differentiated student outcomes within the classroom. Our research context is Australia, where we have a seemingly intractable gap between mainstream educational outcomes and those of disadvantaged groups. We present a study on how teachers’ conscious pedagogic choices worked to support marginalised students. The participatory research focused on a series of science lessons, conducted in a suburban primary school, with a high proportion of students of refugee background. We explain how, in collaboration with teachers, we reframed Bernstein’s abstract notions of regulative and instructional discourses into practical, intentional pedagogic strategies. We describe how these strategies were named and implemented, how they became a shared heuristic for the research team, and the empowering effect they had on teachers and students. The study demonstrates the potential of bringing educational and linguistic theories into practice as classroom pedagogic dialogue, with the empowerment of marginalised students in mind#FRE#
