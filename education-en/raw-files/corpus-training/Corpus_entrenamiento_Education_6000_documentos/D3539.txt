#ITI#Transitions for older people with intellectual disabilities and behaviours that challenge others: A rapid scoping review#FTI#
#IRE#Background: People with intellectual disabilities and behaviours that challenge others are living longer. This review aimed to explore what is known about the health and social care needs, experiences, service interventions and resources of and for this population as they transition to different care contexts in the UK. Method: A rapid scoping review of published and unpublished literature was conducted based on collaborative working with key stakeholders and using systematic methods of data searching, extraction and analysis. Results: Consistent social work support, skilled staff, suitable accommodation, creative engagement with individuals and families to plan ahead, and timely access to quality healthcare are all required to promote successful transitions as people age, and to avoid unwanted/inappropriate transitions at points of crisis. Conclusions: More research is needed to assess the types of services that this population can and do access as they age, the quality of those services, and the extent to which local commissioners are planning ahead for people with intellectual disabilities and behaviours that challenge others#FRE#
