#ITI#The evolution of the association between teacher technology integration and its influencing factors over time#FTI#
#IRE# Teacher technology integration is an evolutionary process, and its relation with various personal and contextual variables may change over time. This study collected questionnaire responses from 429 Chinese K-12 teachers at two time points, and examined how the associations of technology-related beliefs, pedagogical practices and perceived contextual barriers with student-centered technology use and teacher-centered technology use changed over time. PLS path modeling analysis revealed that value belief about technology use became less important and TPACK self-efficacy became more important for both types of technology use over time. The relationship of pedagogical practices with technology use decreased over time too as teachers developed greater flexibility toward technology use. The study further revealed that the evolution of the association varied for student-centered technology use and teacher-centered technology use. The findings advocate a dynamic and differentiated approach to understanding and supporting teacher technology use#FRE#
