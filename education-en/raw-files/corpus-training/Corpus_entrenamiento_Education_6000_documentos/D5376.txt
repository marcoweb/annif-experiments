#ITI#Malleable factors in teaching: why and how to address them from a constructivist perspective#FTI#
#IRE#In this conceptual article, we propose a new approach to investigating changeable factors in teaching. Using a constructivist approach as a conceptual framework, we argue for investigating changeable factors recognizing their malleability and suggest studying teaching as a set of natural experiments. Methodologically, we propose an abductive research approach that moves among four constructs: perceptions, notions, conceptions, and theories. Our proposed research approach is illustrated with a case from a recent empirical study that examines playful learning environments#FRE#
