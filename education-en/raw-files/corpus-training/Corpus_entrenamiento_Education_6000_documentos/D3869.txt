#ITI#A Scoping Review on the Use and Potential of School-Based Drama Therapy to Enhance Socio-emotional Skills in Early Childhood#FTI#
#IRE#Drama therapy incorporates play, imaginary engagement, embodiment, and perspective taking to promote interpersonal skills and affective functioning. Existing school-based drama therapy (SBDT) research has demonstrated utility with select populations; however, much of the SBDT literature has featured disparate findings. Absent from the current literature is a thorough synthesis of the benefits of SBDT for socio-emotional development in early childhood, an age cohort that may be well suited for drama therapy due to the method’s theoretical and practical focus on action, symbolism, and play. A scoping review was conducted to answer the research question: What is the use and potential of SBDT to enhance socio-emotional skills in early childhood? Following a thorough database and manual search, 406 articles were identified and, after screening, 16 articles met the inclusion criteria. Based on the results, practice recommendations include the use of metaphor, distance, and life-drama connection to enhance socio-emotional skills, using dramatic play as a tool to address adverse experiences, and applying SBDT to support specific clinical populations. Policy recommendations include the use of SBDT within a public health trauma approach and the need for ecological integration of SBDT into schools. Research recommendations include the need for a broad-level articulation of a scaffolded SBDT research agenda in schools focused on socio-emotional skills and recommendations specific to methodological and reporting rigor. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
