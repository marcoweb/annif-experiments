#ITI#Struggling to Belong: Evidence From a Survey of Youth Belonging in Public Schools#FTI#
#IRE# This brief reports findings from a survey with middle and high school youth in a midsize district in the Mid-Atlantic. We find that belonging varies by race and ethnicity for young people. Overall, Black and Latino/x youth report lower belonging when compared to their White peers in a pro-diversity and inclusion district. Implications for policy and practice are addressed to improve sense of belonging for racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse youth#FRE#
