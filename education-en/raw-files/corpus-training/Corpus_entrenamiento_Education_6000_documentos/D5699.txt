#ITI#Reading racetrack and self-graphing on reading and behavior of struggling readers with emotional behavioral disorders and learning disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Reading is a fundamental academic skill and influences numerous outcomes throughout lifespan. Unfortunately, many German students struggle with basic reading. Specifically, students with Learning Disabilities (LD) and Emotional Behavioural Disorders (EBD) encounter major hurdles. Consequently, insufficient reading achievement and concomitant behavioural problems diminish motivation to learn. Therefore, a multiple baseline design was used to evaluate the effects of a peer-mediated Reading Racetrack intervention with and without self-graphing on word reading, academically engaged behaviour (AEB), and disruptive behaviour (DB) of primary-school students with LD and EBD (n = 7). The procedure took place three times per week for 25 minutes over a six-week period. As a result, all students increased in reading when Racetracks without Self-Graphing was implemented, without further increases when adding Self-Graphing. There was no intervention effect on AEB in the regression analysis across phases–however, Racetracks with and without Self-Graphing showed significant effects on DB each. Moreover, students rated the intervention positively#FRE#
