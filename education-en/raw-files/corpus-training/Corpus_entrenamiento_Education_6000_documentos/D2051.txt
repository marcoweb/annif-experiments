#ITI#Egyptian female podcasters: shaping feminist identities#FTI#
#IRE# The objective of the research study was to explore how young female podcasters in Egypt acquire feminist knowledge, how their feminist identity has been shaped and, specifically, how podcasts were used for digital feminism. With audio production genres and feminist epistemology frameworks, our analysis shows how podcasts were knowingly utilized as a tool for cyberactivism. The study found that the podcaster’s feminist identities embodied Westernized and/or Black feminist epistemologies, while also indicating a deeper recognition of Egyptian feminism attained during their college careers. The researchers conclude that production of podcasts, informed by feminist pedagogy and epistemologies, was an empowering mechanism for the audio content creators#FRE#
