#ITI#Growth Mixture Modeling With Nonnormal Distributions: Implications for Data Transformation#FTI#
#IRE# This study investigated the extent to which class-specific parameter estimates are biased by the within-class normality assumption in nonnormal growth mixture modeling (GMM). Monte Carlo simulations for nonnormal GMM were conducted to analyze and compare two strategies for obtaining unbiased parameter estimates: relaxing the within-class normality assumption and using data transformation on repeated measures. Based on unconditional GMM with two latent trajectories, data were generated under different sample sizes (300, 800, and 1500), skewness (0.7, 1.2, and 1.6) and kurtosis (2 and 4) of outcomes, numbers of time points (4 and 8), and class proportions (0.5:0.5 and 0.25:0.75). Of the four distributions, it was found that skew-t GMM had the highest accuracy in terms of parameter estimation. In GMM based on data transformations, the adjusted logarithmic method was more effective in obtaining unbiased parameter estimates than the use of van der Waerden quantile normal scores. Even though adjusted logarithmic transformation in nonnormal GMM reduced computation time, skew-t GMM produced much more accurate estimation and was more robust over a range of simulation conditions. This study is significant in that it considers different levels of kurtosis and class proportions, which has not been investigated in depth in previous studies. The present study is also meaningful in that investigated the applicability of data transformation to nonnormal GMM.#FRE#
