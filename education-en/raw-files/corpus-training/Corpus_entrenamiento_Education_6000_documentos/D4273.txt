#ITI#The systemic neoliberal colonisation of higher education: a critical analysis of the obliteration of academic practice#FTI#
#IRE#Within the neoliberal university, scholarship, education, students, academic staff, and practices are subordinated to managerial imperatives. University educators are denigrated and displaced by colonising neoliberal practices that systemically invalidate and invisibilise academic work. The present article provides an example of this by critically analysing the corrosive and Orwellian operations of neoliberal managerialism in higher education through the prism of my own experience of applying for ‘recognition of leadership’ in relation to teaching. I use a narrative ethnographic approach to generate new insights into the obliteration of academic practice in contemporary university contexts and to produce a counter-hegemonic discourse for understanding these processes. Following Habermas inter alia, it is argued that without radical reform, the uncoupling of the ethical and substantive dimensions of the (educational) lifeworld from systemic (neoliberal managerial) strategising will leave higher education in a state of paralysis. The analysis highlights the urgent need for resistance and provides a critical framework for academics to recognise and contest similar colonising processes occurring in their own experiences and contexts. © Crown 2023.#FRE#
