#ITI#Educational data brokers: using the walkthrough method to identify data brokering by edtech platforms#FTI#
#IRE# As a result of the growing commercial marketplace for teachers’ digital data, a new organization that includes educational data brokers has evolved. Educational data brokerage is relatively intangible due to the ease of de-identified data being collected and sold via educational technology. There is an urgent need to expose how the brokerage of educational data relates to the commercial mediation of consent and privacy in educational settings. It is difficult due to a lack of consistent terminology about organizations that buy and sell data. This paper offers an extensive analysis of the social learning platform Edmodo and provides evidence that justifies the term ‘educational data broker’. The results aim to provide new terminology to a largely obfuscated process in educational settings and bring to light a concrete example of brokerage activity focusing on teachers’ online activity#FRE#
