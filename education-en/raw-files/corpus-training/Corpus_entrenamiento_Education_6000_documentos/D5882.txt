#ITI#The mARC instructional design model for more experiential learning in higher education: theoretical foundations and practical guidelines#FTI#
#IRE#The concept of lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important in contemporary educational research and development. Although the relationship between experience (practice) and knowledge (theory) is becoming an important aspect of the formal learning process, current instructional design models do not point to educational strategies that support learners in re- and de-contextualisation (both directions of Kolb's learning cycle). This article aims to provide more insight into the process of creating and redesigning experiential learning environments and to better understand the complex relationship that exists between the learning environments and experiential learning (considering underlying learning theories). We will present and discuss mARC (more Authentic, Reflective and Collaborative), a three-component instruction model with a set of instructional elements proved to facilitate the re- and de-contextualisation of knowledge. This article ends with practical guidelines for using the mARC model to support students in linking learning experience to academic knowledge development within higher education#FRE#
