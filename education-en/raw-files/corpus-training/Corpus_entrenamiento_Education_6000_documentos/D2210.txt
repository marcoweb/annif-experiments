#ITI#A systematic review of published student question-generation systems: Supporting functionalities and design features#FTI#
#IRE# There has been an increasing interest in the development of student question-generation (SQG) systems since 2000. To offer a holistic and detailed view of extant SQG systems, a two-dimensional classification scheme was derived to identify commonly embedded ancillary functionalities and design features in the 54 SQG learning systems located through a systematic review. The results revealed that six ancillary functionalities most frequently included around question-generation are management, question-assessment, question-answering, question-viewing, communication, and gamification in that order. Additionally, SQG systems differ greatly in terms of design features, with the majority falling under the domain-specific type, supporting only one type of question-generation, gearing toward the free SQG type, not providing scaffolding of any type, and not allowing the inclusion of multimedia files for SQG#FRE#
