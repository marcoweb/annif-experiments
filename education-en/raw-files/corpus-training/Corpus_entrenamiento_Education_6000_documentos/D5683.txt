#ITI#Interprofessional collaboration between educational psychologists and speech and language therapists in the UK: facilitators and barriers#FTI#
#IRE#In the UK, speech and language therapists (SLTs) and educational psychologists (EPs) are professionals who support children with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN). Legislative and socio-economic changes within the UK and continuing concern about poor outcomes for children with SLCN provided the impetus for a focus on interprofessional collaboration between these two groups. An online survey was distributed to qualified EPs and SLTs in the UK enquiring about facilitators and barriers to collaboration. Responses from 125 EPs and 182 SLTs were content analysed. Responses indicated that communication and working environments were key factors impacting interprofessional collaboration. Relationships and commitment to joint working were also cited as facilitators. Challenges related to reduced resourcing, staffing and changes to working environments as a result of austerity. A framework illustrating possible inter-relationships between factors is presented, indicating hypothesised pathways that could underpin planning for development and change. In summary, despite positive moves towards shared policy and guidance for children with SLCN, findings suggest that a continued focus on maximising effective interprofessional collaboration is crucial to ensure that assessment and early intervention are available to support children with speech, language and communication needs#FRE#
