#ITI#Indigenous early career researchers: creating pearls in the academy#FTI#
#IRE#This paper provides a snapshot of Indigenous Early Career Researchers in Australia derived from demographic information collected in the first stage of the ‘Developing Indigenous Early Career Researchers’ project. Analysis of the data to date has evidenced much diversity across this cohort. However, one commonality across all Indigenous Early Career Researchers was a commitment to the value and validity of Indigenous Ways of Knowing in the higher education sector. With the use of Tribal Critical Race Theory this paper explores the ways in which Indigenous Early Career Researchers disrupt Western-based academies and schools of thought and proposes that Indigenous Early Carer Researchers grow ‘pearls’ of experience and knowledge within the higher education sector that are essential to the development of a richer academy and stronger Indigenous communities#FRE#
