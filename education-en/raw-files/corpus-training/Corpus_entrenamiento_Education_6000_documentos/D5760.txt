#ITI#The perceived effect of environmental and sustainability education on environmental literacy of Czech teenagers#FTI#
#IRE#The article presents findings from a Czech environmental literacy survey conducted in 2020 on a sample of 6th (N = 3773), 8th (N = 21518), and 9th graders (N = 4368). Specifically, the effect of environmental and sustainability education (ESE) as well as the effect of gender and age on environmental knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, place attachment, locus of control and behavior were analyzed with regard to teaching strategies. The analyses revealed significant differences between respondents who participate in residential outdoor environmental education programs, those who were involved in a school eco-club or a nature-oriented non-formal-education youth clubs compared to those not involved in these activities. In addition, the perceived holistic, emancipatory, and community-based ESE approaches were among the significant predictors of environmental literacy. The findings support the relevance of the ESE strategies examined in shaping environmental literacy of young students. Older students and boys showed a lower level of pro-environmental values and behavior#FRE#
