#ITI#Mindfulness in the foreign language classroom: Influence on academic achievement and awareness#FTI#
#IRE# Incorporating mindfulness into education has been linked to improving academic, social and emotional learning. This article describes an investigation of the implementation of meditative practices in a foreign language setting (German). Two classes underwent distinct varieties of meditation: The count-to-ten method and the guided meditation approach, whereas a third class served as a comparison group by not partaking in meditative activities. Meditative practices were implemented for a period of one year and data were collected on students’ academic achievement, measures of mindfulness, and evaluations of their perspectives on meditative practices. Results revealed that classes in the treatment conditions showed marked signs of academic achievement and increased awareness relative to the comparison group. Differences were revealed between the two meditation methods in terms of distinct aspects of mindfulness as measured by the five-facet mindfulness questionnaire (FFMQ). In addition, students showed a positive disposition towards meditative practices in general, which was measured by a new developed instrument: the five spheres of meditation experience survey (FSMES). Results suggest that meditative practices may play a role in designing and developing novel pedagogical practices.#FRE#
