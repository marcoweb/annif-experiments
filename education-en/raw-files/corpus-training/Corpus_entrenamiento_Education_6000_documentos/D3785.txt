#ITI#Examining the Implementation of Conscious Discipline®: A Qualitative Study Utilizing the I-PARIHS Framework#FTI#
#IRE#Behavior disorders in early childhood are a major public health concern. A large percentage of young children spend their day in childcare settings, making early childhood educators a relevant population to target for behavior management interventions and training. Conscious Discipline® (CD®) is an evidence-based program targeting social emotional learning that involves helping teachers modify classroom environment and teacher strategies to address children’s disruptive behavior. Although CD® has been widely disseminated across the country, very few studies have examined the implementation of the intervention, particularly within early childhood education settings. The current study utilized the promoting action on research implementation in health services framework (i-PARIHS) to assess both facilitators and barriers related to successful implementation among a large cohort of pre-Kindergarten teachers (N = 269). Qualitative methods were utilized to assess teachers’ perceived impact of CD®; implementation of structures, rituals, and routines; and both facilitators and barriers to implementation. Results revealed both facilitators and barriers across domains of the innovation; recipients; and local, organizational, and external contexts. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed#FRE#
