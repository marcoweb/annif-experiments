#ITI#Design and Implementation of an Automated Classroom Analytics System: Stakeholder Engagement and Mapping#FTI#
#IRE#Computational analysis methods and machine learning techniques introduce innovative ways to capture classroom interactions and display data on analytics dashboards. Automated classroom analytics employ advanced data analysis, providing educators with comprehensive insights into student participation, engagement, and behavioral trends within classroom settings. Through the provision of context-sensitive feedback, automated classroom analytics systems can be integrated into the evidence-based pedagogical decision-making and reflective practice processes of faculty members in higher education institutions. This paper presents TEACHActive, an automated classroom analytics system, by detailing its design and implementation. It outlines the processes of stakeholder engagement and mapping, elucidates the benefits and obstacles associated with a comprehensive classroom analytics system design, and concludes by discussing significant implications. These implications propose user-centric design approaches for higher education researchers and practitioners to consider#FRE#
