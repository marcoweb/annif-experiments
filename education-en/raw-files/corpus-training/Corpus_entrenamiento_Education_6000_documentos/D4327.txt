#ITI#Managing classroom management preparation in teacher education#FTI#
#IRE#Classroom management preparation has long been insufficient and stagnant, creating issues that disproportionately impacts beginning teacher success. I propose the CM PReP framework to guide teacher educators towards redesigning courses to appropriately prepare pre-service teachers to manage the needs of current students. By fixating classroom management courses around culture, methods, practice, relationships, and partnerships, teacher education can implement incremental yet substantive changes to strengthen a pedagogical skill where many beginning teachers have persistently struggled. This article is most pertinent to teacher educators and teacher preparation programmes, but also offers recommendations for future research#FRE#
