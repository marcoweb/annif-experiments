#ITI#Towards Inquiry-Based Flipped Classroom Scenarios: a Design Heuristic and Principles for Lesson Planning#FTI#
#IRE#The effectiveness of flipped classroom approaches can be improved by combining it with other pedagogical models such as inquiry-based learning. Implementing inquiry-based learning in flipped classroom scenarios requires teachers to plan arrangements for in- and out-of-class activities carefully. In this study, a design heuristic based on the 5E inquiry model was developed to support teachers’ practice of planning inquiry-based flipped classroom lessons. Following a design-based research approach, the design heuristic progressed through two cycles within 2 years. The design heuristic was implemented in both cycles in an online professional development course for secondary mathematics teachers. In the first cycle, 18 lesson plans were collected and analysed using the 5E lesson plan scoring instrument. Results showed that the design heuristic helped teachers to set up lesson plans for flipped classroom scenarios which were mostly in line with the 5E model. However, the evaluation phase was insufficiently addressed. Revision decisions were made at the end of the first cycle, and the design heuristic was revised and re-implemented in a second cycle. Results of the second cycle showed another 19 participating teachers who also struggled in choosing appropriate assessment techniques, an issue which could not be resolved with the proposed design heuristic. This paper describes the development of the design heuristic as well as relevant design principles for inquiry-based flipped classroom scenarios. The proposed design heuristic is not domain specific. Hence, further research could examine its use in other subjects or interdisciplinary as inquiry-based flipped classroom approaches are one of the emerging pedagogies#FRE#
