#ITI#What is the degree of teacher centrality in optimal teaching of digital literacy in a technology-enhanced environment? Typology of teacher prototypes#FTI#
#IRE# This study explored the degree of teachers’ centrality in the classroom while developing digital literacies of their students and the pedagogical strategies which are employed by teachers in this process. We conducted a bottom-up analysis on 65 semi-structured interviews (n = 4372 statements) based on two conceptual frameworks: the Digital Literacy framework and the 5Cs framework with a nation-wide sample of elementary and secondary-teachers. The findings offer a typology of four teacher prototypes regarding the degree of their centrality in a technology-enhanced classroom and the mapped pedagogical strategies employed by each prototype. Based on bottom-up coding, the study expands the above-mentioned frameworks regarding re-production thinking, socio-emotional thinking, e-communication, and collaboration literacies. We discuss the implications for educational theory and practice#FRE#
