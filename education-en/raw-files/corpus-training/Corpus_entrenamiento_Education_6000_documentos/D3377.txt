#ITI#Schooling for transnational solidarity? a comparison of differently Europeanising school curricula in Germany#FTI#
#IRE#To what extent are differently ‘Europeanising’ school forms programmatically geared towards building transnational solidarities, as their ethoses might suggest? This study draws on an analysis of discursive constructions of solidarity in the curricula for social studies and humanities at secondary level of two forms of schooling promoting a European ethos: the supranationally organised Schola Europaea and state-organised schools with a European profile in Germany (Europaschulen). I argue that solidarity is anchored in universalising ideals of humanitarianism, intercultural harmony, and political participation centred around the individual and her skills rather than a sense of a ‘thick’ pan-European community. The ‘transnational’ scale of solidarity manifests as interpersonal relationships beyond national affiliations, based on affective, religious, and ethical commitments to vulnerable others or on rational political action to ensure human and civil rights. Meanings and scales of solidarity are decoupled from the Europeanising ethos of the schools and from the different organisational logics in which they are embedded; instead, they reflect the disciplinary logics of the school subjects and curricular contexts where they are most often mobilised: religion, ethics, and politics. The paper ends with a discussion of these findings within broader debates on transnational solidarities and Europeanisation in education#FRE#
