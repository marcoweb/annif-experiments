#ITI#Evolutionary Perspective on Human Cognitive Architecture in Cognitive Load Theory: a Dynamic, Emerging Principle Approach#FTI#
#IRE# Adopting an evolutionary approach to substantiate major characteristics of human cognitive architecture has been one of the major recent developments in cognitive load theory. According to this approach, human cognitive architecture is a natural information processing system which can be described by five general principles. This paper attempts to (1) identify the scope of applicability of these principles in natural information processing systems of different levels of complexity, (2) reconcile the coexistence of implicit (primary) and controlled (secondary) processes within the same human cognitive architecture, and (3) incorporate motivational factors into the evolutionary approach to human cognitive architecture. The paper suggests two principal modifications to the traditional formulation of the evolutionary approach. Firstly, natural information processing systems are viewed as dynamically evolving systems with new principles added with increasing levels of complexity of the systems. Secondly, a new (the explicit intention to learn) principle is added at the level of human cognition. This sixth principle is expected to address (1) the emergence of controlled mechanisms dealing with biologically secondary information as expressed by conscious processing in working memory and (2) the role of learner motivation in such processes from an evolutionary perspective. The paper concludes with discussion of theoretical and practical instructional implications of the proposed modifications#FRE#
