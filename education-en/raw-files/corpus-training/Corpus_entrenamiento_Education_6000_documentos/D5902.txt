#ITI#Developing effective assessment feedback: academic buoyancy and the relational dimensions of feedback#FTI#
#IRE#This research reports on the second phase of a project exploring the effectiveness of tutor to student assessment feedback. It highlights the dynamic interaction of interpersonal and intrapersonal contexts in effective feedback processes. It proposes a holistic conceptualisation of feedback that considers the academic buoyancy and attributes of the recipient, and the relationships and opportunities for dialogue with the provider and the ramifications for practice. To explore the impact of the implementation of changes to practice suggested from phase one of the research, qualitative data were collected and analysed from student focus groups and individual interviews within a UK undergraduate education course. Links from this phase between feedback processes, affect, tutor input and the ‘Key 5’ indicators of academic buoyancy emerge, revealing the importance of reciprocal relationships and dialogic interactions. This demonstrates the need to acknowledge the individuals involved and the nature of the relationships between them#FRE#
