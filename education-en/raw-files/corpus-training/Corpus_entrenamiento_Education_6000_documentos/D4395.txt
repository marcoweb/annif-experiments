#ITI#Social justice in English language learning in Ecuador: beliefs of indigenous higher education teachers and indigenous and mestizo student teachers#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this study was to explore indigenous teachers’ and indigenous and mestizo student teachers’ beliefs about social justice and English language learning in the Ecuadorian context. Based on data collected through interviews and one focus group session, it was found that many indigenous believe English might be a convenient tool for personal and professional development as well as intercultural communication. On the other hand, even though some laws have been passed and awareness has been raised in Ecuador regarding the need for social justice pertaining to indigenous people, the participants indicated that this community is still an underprivileged group#FRE#
