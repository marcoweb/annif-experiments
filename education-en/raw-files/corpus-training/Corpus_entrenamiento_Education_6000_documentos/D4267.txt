#ITI#The complexities of negotiating school choice for parents with gender diverse children#FTI#
#IRE#Understandings of gender diversity have increasingly recognised the rights and experiences of children and young people (Meyer & Pullen Sansfaçon, 2014, Smith et al., 2014). A small, but significant body of work focusses on the schooling experiences of gender diverse children/young people. The critical role parents play in supporting gender diverse children/young people is acknowledged (Davy & Cordoba, 2020; Riley et al., 2011), including their involvement in negotiating schooling. This research uses a qualitative research design to explore the schooling experiences of five parents with gender diverse children, attending primary or secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. A feminist poststructuralist framework was used to analyse the complex factors that influenced school choice, and to explore the challenges or opportunities they had encountered during their child’s schooling years. The participants in this study highlighted the qualities of schools they believed to be inclusive, which affirmed their own school choice. However, participants also reflected on their sense of rejection when their children were not accommodated at school, or when they had to find a new school. Negotiations around school choice were made easier with economic and social capital. These findings highlight the layered inequalities of the Australian educational marketplace. © The Australian Association for Research in Education, Inc. 2024.#FRE#
