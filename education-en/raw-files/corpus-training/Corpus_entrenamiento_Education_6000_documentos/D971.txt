#ITI#A Model for Integrating Engineering Design into Science Teacher Education#FTI#
#IRE# The Framework for K-12 Science Education and the Next Generation Science Standards require teachers to integrate engineering design into K-12 science teaching. However, many teachers have no formal preparation in engineering design and how to integrate it into science instruction. Furthermore, few models exist for preparing teachers in engineering design and how to integrate it into science teaching. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the model we have used for the past 8 years to prepare eighty-one (81) secondary pre-service science teachers in engineering design and how to integrate it into science instruction. We have also provided the outcomes and suggestions for implementing this model in science teacher education programs. We believe the model is transferable to other institutions and school districts that are involved in preparing teachers in engineering design integrated science teaching#FRE#
