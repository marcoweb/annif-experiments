#ITI#Linking cognitive load, mindfulness, and self-efficacy in college students with and without learning disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#The goal of this study was to test whether cognitive load is associated with mindfulness and self-efficacy in students with and without learning disabilities. In this study, 60 students with learning disabilities and 60 students without learning disabilities were evaluated for cognitive load, mindfulness, and self-efficacy using three separate instruments. Study findings showed that the learning-disabled population performed consistently worse both on cognitive load and on mindfulness and self-efficacy than the normally developed population. Significant associations were found between the variables only in the group of students without learning disabilities. This study’s findings point to the importance of developing both student and teacher training programmes that focus on effective methods for reducing cognitive load and improving focus and mindfulness, ultimately resulting in improved self-efficacy in students with learning disabilities#FRE#
