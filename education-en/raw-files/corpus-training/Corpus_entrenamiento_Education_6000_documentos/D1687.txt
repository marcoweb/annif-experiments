#ITI#The longitudinal contribution of mapping to arithmetic: Do numeral knowledge, inhibition or analogical reasoning matter?#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Recent studies have revealed the association between mapping and arithmetic (Ferres-Forga et al., J. Numer. Cogn., 8, 2022, 123; LeFevre et al., J. Numer. Cogn., 8, 2022, 1). Aim: The underlying mechanism remains unclear. Materials & Methods: The current study recruited 118 kindergarten children and followed up on them three times at 6-month intervals. They completed measures to assess mapping skills (T1), non-verbal IQ (T1), numeral knowledge (T2), inhibitory control (T2), analogical reasoning (T2) and arithmetic (T3). Results: The results showed that mapping accounted for significant variance in arithmetic ability over and above age, gender and non-verbal IQ. Furthermore, analogical reasoning played an important role in the relationship between mapping and mathematics ability. Discussion: The findings suggest the association between mapping and mathematics ability prior to formal schooling. Conclusion: Analogical reasoning, rather than numeral knowledge or inhibitory control, may drive that association in young children#FRE#
