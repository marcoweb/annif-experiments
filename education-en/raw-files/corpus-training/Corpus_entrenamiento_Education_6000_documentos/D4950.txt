#ITI#Student Affairs Professionals Experiences With Campus Racial Climate at Predominantly White Institutions#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study is to examine Student Affairs Professionals’ (SAPs’) experiences with campus racial climate at predominantly white institutions (PWIs) including how SAPs make meaning of racialized incidents on campus. This study employed the multi-contextual model for diverse learning environments (MMDLE) and critical incident technique (CIT) as frameworks and used a multiple case study methodological approach analyzing 12 SAPs’ experiences with campus racial climate using a constant comparative data analysis strategy. Findings from this study include how SAPs’ overall experiences with campus racial climate encompass a “business as usual” mindset from campus constituents. Participants shared how the current political climate in relation to issues of race has shaped incidents on campus and dynamics regarding racialized incidents. As a result, SAPs often processed these occurrences with trusted peers and colleagues due to fear of retaliation. Participants, specifically those of Color, noted their challenges of balancing institutional racism, racial battle fatigue, and microaggressions while processing and making meaning of racialized incidents. In-depth implications and recommendations for practice are described to prepare and support SAPs in these vital roles on campus#FRE#
