#ITI#Engagement and attribution of increased engagement to learning assistants in learning assistant-supported classes#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of the study is to explore various facets of engagement in courses with Learning Assistant (LA) support. LA programmes frequently demonstrate positive effects on student learning and persistence, yet less is known about the nuances of the impact on student engagement. Data collected from students and LAs via online questionnaires are analysed to assess and compare the extent to which students and LAs perceive the presence of LAs contributes to increased student engagement. Results show both groups attribute students’ increased levels of social, cognitive, and affective engagement to the presence of the LAs more strongly than they do increased academic engagement. However, compared to students, LAs view their presence as more impactful across nearly all engagement facets. Training of LAs should therefore encourage LAs to target specific types of engagement they intend to impact, particularly cognitive engagement and social engagement with professors, while clarifying these aims with students#FRE#
