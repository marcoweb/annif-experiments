#ITI#Science Fiction Fan Conventions as Places to Communicate Science#FTI#
#IRE#Science fiction conventions are places where the convergence of science fiction and science is discussed within diverse communities. Many of these science fiction conventions offer programming focused on science, often described as science tracks, for science experts to share their experiences, expertise, scientific findings, and applications related to current research in connection to science fiction with the public. Framing the study within a socio-cultural context, this study surveyed experts’ (n = 19) perceived beliefs of science communication at science fiction conventions. Experts cited accessibility and promoting scientific curiosity as the greatest benefits and identified misconceptions or misinterpretation by the audience as challenges. Overall, experts agreed that communicating science is important and science fiction has a great impact on science. Because of the public access to experts, it is important to highlight the potential influence science fiction conventions may have on science communication via socio-cultural experiences and contexts within popular culture. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
