#ITI#Comparing the effectiveness of two diagnostic approaches for the interpretation of oral radiographic lesions by dental students#FTI#
#IRE# Interpreting radiographic lesions on dental radiographs is a challenging process especially for novice learners, and there is a lack of tools available to support this diagnostic process. This study introduced dental students to two diagnostic aids with contrasting reasoning approaches—ORAD DDx, which uses an analytic, forward reasoning approach, and a Radiographic Atlas, which emphasizes a non-analytic, backward reasoning approach. We compared the effectiveness of ORAD DDx and the Atlas in improving students’ diagnostic accuracy and their ability to recall features of radiographic lesions. Participants (99 third-year dental students) were assigned to ORAD DDx, Atlas and Control groups. In the pre-test and post-test, participants provided their diagnosis for eight types of radiographic lesions. All groups also completed a Cued Recall Test. Feedback about ORAD DDx and the Atlas was collected. Results indicated that the Atlas was more effective than ORAD DDx in improving diagnostic accuracy (Estimated marginal mean difference = 1.88 (95% CI 0.30–3.46), p = 0.014, Cohen’s d = 0.714). Participants in the Atlas group also outperformed the Control group in the recall of the lesions’ radiographic features (Estimated marginal mean difference = 3.42 (95% CI 0.85–5.99), p = 0.005, Cohen’s d = 0.793). Students reported that both ORAD DDx and Atlas increased their confidence and decreased the mental effort required to develop differential diagnosis (p ≤ 0.001). This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a non-analytic approach in interpreting dental radiographs among novice learners through the novel use of diagnostic aids#FRE#
