#ITI#Information and communication technology engagement and digital reading: How meta-cognitive strategies impact their relationship#FTI#
#IRE# The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships among information and communication technology (ICT) engagement, meta-cognitive strategies and digital reading. Specifically, we used PISA 2018 data to examine whether (a) the behavioural aspect of ICT engagement negatively impacted digital reading, (b) the motivational aspect of ICT engagement positively impacted digital reading and (c) meta-cognitive strategies mediated or moderated the relationship between ICT engagement and digital reading. Our findings revealed that (a) the behavioural aspect of ICT engagement negatively impacted digital reading, whereas the motivational aspect of ICT engagement, except ICT social motivation, positively impacted digital reading; (b) the behavioural aspect of ICT engagement, as well as ICT social motivation, had significant negative indirect effects on digital reading achievement through meta-cognitive strategies, whereas all other motivational aspects of ICT engagement were differentially mediated by the meta-cognitive strategies; (c) the impact of ICT social motivation on ICT engagement was mediated and moderated by meta-cognitive strategies. These findings are discussed in terms of the educational implications, limitations and future directions. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic There is ambiguity in the literature regarding the relationship between ICT engagement and achievement. The nature of the relationships among ICT engagement, meta-cognitive strategy use and achievement in digital reading remains unclear. What this paper adds The behavioural aspect of ICT engagement, as well as ICT social motivation, had significant negative indirect effects on digital reading achievement through meta-cognitive strategies, whereas all other motivational aspects of ICT engagement were differentially mediated by the meta-cognitive strategies. The impact of ICT social motivation on ICT engagement was mediated and moderated by meta-cognitive strategies. Implications for practice and/or policy Practitioners should focus on how to utilize ICT by applying appropriate strategies. Students' knowledge about and use of meta-cognitive strategies play positive roles even in the contexts when rote learning activities predominate#FRE#
