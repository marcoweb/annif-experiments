#ITI#Feminism, Islam and higher education: towards new roles and family relationships for young Spanish-Moroccan Muslim women in Spain#FTI#
#IRE# This article examines the lives and family relationships of young women of Moroccan descent in Catalonia, Spain. Based on ethnographic research and life stories, we have found that access to Higher Education has led these young women to a feminist interpretation of the Qur’an. This interpretation allows them to identify as Muslim women while refuting traditional gender roles. The young women surveyed argue that the bases of gender equity can be found in the Qur’an, but are hidden behind misinterpretations that put the role of women in a disadvantaged position with regard to men. Our study evidences that through this reformulation of Islam, in conjunction with a successful academic pathway, they have started to gain a position of authority and recognition within their families, leading to changes in their family roles and relationships#FRE#
