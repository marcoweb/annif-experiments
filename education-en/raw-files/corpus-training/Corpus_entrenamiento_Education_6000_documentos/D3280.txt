#ITI#Multiple Perspectives with Online EFL Practicum Technology Learning: Case Study on a Cloud#FTI#
#IRE#This yearlong study describes multiple stakeholders’ perspectives of 20 preservice English as Foreign Language (EFL) teachers, 43 elementary school students, 2 online mentors, and a teacher-researcher during a technology professional development practicum on a cloud. The case study provides qualitative and quantitative data from stakeholders concerning technology integration after participating in online project-based EFL instruction. The participating stakeholders encountered affordances and challenges that enhanced their online learning and teaching repertoires and offered nuanced evidence within this online professional development community. The findings call for continuing exploration of online practicums in preservice (language) teacher education and further research documenting complexities of multiple stakeholders’ technology professional development#FRE#
