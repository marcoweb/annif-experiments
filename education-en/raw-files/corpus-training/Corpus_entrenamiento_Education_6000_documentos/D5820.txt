#ITI#Learning in and from the field: a qualitative study of affective engagement#FTI#
#IRE#Affective engagement is critical if environmental education is to promote pro-environmental behaviors. Given the contextual complexities impacting the affective domain in environmental education, affective engagement may vary depending on the programs, cohorts and classes. In this ethnographic case study, we used point-of-view (POV) camera glasses along with written and verbal student reflections to track the moment-to-moment first-person experiences and the post-trip reflections of secondary school students associated with an ecology field trip to a local coastal area. This case study offers an in-depth account of two students’ affective engagement during the field trip. One student demonstrated great interest and curiosity when learning about nature despite being scared to touch wildlife, whereas another student demonstrated limited interest in the field trip but showed a strong desire to protect nature. These findings suggest a complicated, unpredictable relationship between interest in and curiosity about nature, motivation and constraints to learn, environmental consciousness, intention, and ability to act on behalf of nature. Future research should attend to why students feel the way they feel and how they achieve affective learning outcomes during planned and chance encounters in natural outdoor settings#FRE#
