#ITI#Feedback in higher education: aligning academic intent and student sensemaking#FTI#
#IRE#Research indicates that effective learner-centred feedback requires learner agency, impact and sensemaking. While scholars are focusing on supporting agency and impact, limited research has addressed sensemaking. This is problematic, because if learners fail to understand feedback, impact is likely to be reduced. In response, this study examines (non) alignment between teacher intent and student sensemaking of authentic feedback comments. The sample included four teachers and eighteen students from two Australian universities. Data were collected via stimulated recall interviews and a feedback coding task. The results suggest that sensemaking of strength-based comments, critiques and actionable information was aided when the comments were clear and specific. On the other hand, sensemaking was limited when comments were designed to mitigate against negative affect, overloaded with multiple intentions, or overly brief. This study informs theory around learner-centred feedback design which, in turn, improves the likelihood that teacher comments will be interpreted accurately by learners#FRE#
