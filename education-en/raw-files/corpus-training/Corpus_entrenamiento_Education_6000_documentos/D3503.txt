#ITI#Exploring the psychometric properties of self-report instruments used to measure health-related quality of life and subjective wellbeing of adolescents with intellectual disabilities: A Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) systematic review#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Studies that have systematically reviewed the psychometric properties of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and subjective wellbeing instruments for adolescents with intellectual disabilities narrowly focus on disease or health-specific conditions. This review aimed to critically appraise the psychometric properties of self-report instruments used to measure HRQoL and subjective wellbeing of adolescents with intellectual disabilities. Method: A systematic search was undertaken in four databases. The quality of the included studies and their psychometric properties was assessed according to the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement Instruments Risk of Bias checklist. Results: Seven studies reported psychometric properties of five different instruments. Only one instrument identified as having potential to be recommended for use but requires further validation research to assess its quality for this population. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to support the recommendation of a self-report instrument to assess HRQoL and subjective wellbeing of adolescents with intellectual disabilities#FRE#
