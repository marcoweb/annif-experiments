#ITI#HOTS-Link Mobile Learning Application: Enabling Biology Pre-service Teachers to Devise HOTS-Based Lesson Plans#FTI#
#IRE# The ICT-based learning model has been a catalyst in the field of modern education to teach higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). However, a few studies promoted technology-based HOTS learning to advance pre-service teachers’ ability in devising HOTS-based lesson plans. This study aimed to examine how the HOTS-Link mobile learning application assisted biology pre-service teachers in devising HOTS-based lesson plans and describe their responses on the utility of the application. The study used a descriptive-quantitative research approach with an ADDIE research design, especially in the implementation stage. The data were obtained using documentation of learning outcomes and questionnaires completed by 20 biology pre-service teachers. The results showed that the HOTS-Link mobile learning application could increase pre-service teachers’ ability in devising HOTS-based lesson plans. Another finding portrayed that all pre-service teachers conveyed a positive response toward the easy usage of the application. The present study implied that the HOTS-Link mobile learning application could be used by biology teachers to create HOTS-based lesson plans, especially for the Indonesian curriculum#FRE#
