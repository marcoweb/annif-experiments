#ITI#Spontaneous Use of Retrieval and Rereading: Relation to Achievement Goals and Exam Performance#FTI#
#IRE# Laboratory research has demonstrated that when students are instructed to use retrieval (i.e., recalling from memory information to be learned) rather than rereading (i.e., reading the material repeatedly) they learn better. However, little is known about spontaneous use of retrieval. In the present studies, we designed a scale to measure spontaneous use, perceived enjoyment, perceived effort, and perceived effectiveness of retrieval and rereading. Across two studies, we found that students perceived retrieval to be more enjoyable, effortful, and effective than rereading. In Study 2, we additionally examined the relation between achievement goals, spontaneous study strategies, and exam performance. We found that both mastery-approach goals and mastery-avoidance goals predicted use of retrieval and rereading. No other achievement goals predicted use of study strategies. We also found that spontaneous use of retrieval positively predicted exam performance; there was no relation between use of rereading and exam performance. These studies suggest that like instructed use of retrieval, spontaneous use of retrieval facilitates exam performance. However, unlike instructed use of rereading, spontaneous use of rereading is not deleterious to exam performance. This may be due to variation in the time students spontaneously spend studying (in contrast to a lab task where total time studying is the same across all participants). This initial step in investigating spontaneous use of study strategies is important for understanding and encouraging effective approaches to studying#FRE#
