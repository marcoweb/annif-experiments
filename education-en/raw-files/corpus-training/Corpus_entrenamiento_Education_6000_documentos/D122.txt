#ITI#A HOPE for Study Abroad: Evidence From Tennessee on the Impact of Merit-Aid Policy Adoption on Study Abroad Participation#FTI#
#IRE# Two distinct literature bases exist documenting the benefits of study aboard participation and state-adopted merit-aid policies. However, few, to date, have estimated the impact of merit-aid adoption on study abroad participation. Results from our study demonstrate the potential positive externality merit-aid policy adoption has on study abroad participation. In addition, we find that increases in study abroad participation is concentrated primarily within public doctoral/research institutions and institutions with students from more affluent families.#FRE#
