#ITI#Middle School Student Knowledge of and Attitudes Toward Synthetic Biology#FTI#
#IRE# Synthetic biology is a field that leverages design, biology, engineering, and computation to genetically engineer organisms to make usable products such as sustainably manufactured textiles, biodegradable chemicals, and personalized medicine. Despite increases in access, we know little about what younger learners know and think about these modern applications. This is problematic for reasons related to civic engagement and field participation. This research addresses this by examining a group (n = 66) of middle school youth (ages 11 to 14) in the United States (US). Analysis of survey and interview data suggests that, while students know very little about synthetic biology, they nevertheless have well-formed attitudes that involve considerations that are typically observed in older student groups. Findings also suggest that perspectives among this group were still forming and flexible. Opportunities to support student learning and literacy in this emerging field are discussed in terms of their geopolitical, sociocultural, and educational influences#FRE#
