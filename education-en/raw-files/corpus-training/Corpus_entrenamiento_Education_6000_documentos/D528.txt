#ITI#Preparing Teacher Candidates for Trauma-Informed Practices#FTI#
#IRE# Children who experience trauma may experience negative health and educational outcomes. Teachers are critical stakeholders in trauma-informed schools and are tasked with recognizing and responding to the needs of students who experience trauma. However, teachers face barriers to implementing trauma-informed practices, including high levels of stress and lack of preparation. This article describes training embedded in an urban teacher preparation program aimed at increasing the trauma knowledge and skills confidence of teacher candidates. Findings suggest the training helped teacher candidates increase knowledge and skills and met stated needs. Recommendations for future research and implications for teachers and teacher educators are discussed.#FRE#
