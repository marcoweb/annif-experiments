#ITI#Elite schools lead: an empirical examination of diversity requirements in higher education job markets#FTI#
#IRE# Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) statements for job applicants in higher education are somewhat controversial. Advocates argue that DEI requirements ensure fair representation, counter historical discrimination, and improve efficiency. Critics contend that DEI requirements reduce faculty quality by limiting the number of eligible applicants and by screening out heterodox views, thereby limiting potential research. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the use of mandatory DEI statements is growing; yet, there have been no empirical investigations of their frequency, nor how such requirements vary across academic disciplines, geographic region, and university selectivity. We audit a sample of academic job postings (n = 999) during September-October 2020, finding that nearly twenty percent require DEI statements. We find selective universities are significantly more likely to require DEI statements than non-selective universities, while academic disciplines (i.e. social sciences, STEM) are not significant predictors of DEI statements. We also find evidence of regional variation#FRE#
