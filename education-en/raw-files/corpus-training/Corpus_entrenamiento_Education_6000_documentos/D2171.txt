#ITI#Attitude and technological pedagogical and content knowledge: The reciprocal predictors?#FTI#
#IRE# Attitude toward technology integration and TPACK have been found to influence technology integration. However, little research has been dedicated to examining the relationship between them. This paper reports on a study that investigated the relationship between mathematics teachers’ attitudes and TPACK for 125 participants from Dar es Salaam—Tanzania who filled out the attitude and TPACK questionnaires. The Pearson product-moment correlation and standard multiple regression were used for analysis. Attitude and TPACK were seen to have a strong positive correlation. Models involving attitude dimensions and TPACK dimensions were seen to predict TPACK and attitude respectively. Implications from this relationship are provided#FRE#
