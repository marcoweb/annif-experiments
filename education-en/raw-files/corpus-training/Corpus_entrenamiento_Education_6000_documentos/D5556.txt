#ITI#Enhancing school climate through social and emotional learning: effects of RULER in Mexican secondary schools#FTI#
#IRE#We investigated the impact of RULER—an evidence-based approach to social and emotional learning—on school climate. Students and teachers from 37 Mexican high schools completed measures of school climate and school satisfaction before, one year into, and two years into RULER implementation. There were significant improvements in multiple dimensions of school climate, including teaching quality, student relationships, adult relationships, student–adult relationships, discipline, support for social and emotional learning, student voice, and respect for diversity, as well as school satisfaction. Many of these effects were found after adult training, before students received RULER directly. We discuss implications of these findings for improving social and emotional learning and school climate#FRE#
