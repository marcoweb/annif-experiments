#ITI#A qualitative exploration of the unique barriers, challenges and experiences encountered by undergraduate psychology students with mental health problems#FTI#
#IRE# Research demonstrating student mental distress typically focuses on mental wellbeing by combining questionnaire responses from students studying a variety of disciplines [see Ibrahim, A. K., S. J. Kelly, C. E. Adams, and C. Glazebrook. 2013. “A Systematic Review of Studies of Depression Prevalence in University Students.” Journal of Psychiatric Research 47 (3): 391–400; Bewick, B., G. Koutsopoulou, J. Miles, E. Slaa, and M. Barkham. 2010. “Changes in Undergraduate Students’ Psychological Well-being as they Progress Through University.” Studies in Higher Education 35 (6): 633–645]. Little is known about how student mental health varies as a function of degree type. Psychology students are of interest here, as Psychology is one of few degrees where mental health is a topic of study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 undergraduate psychology students with mental health difficulties from a UK University. Thematic analysis showed that previous mental health problems were a motivator for studying psychology. The delivery of taught mental health content exacerbated pre-existing symptoms, induced concern and challenged perceptions of treatments. Students also experienced unique challenges when accessing a variety of University support networks. Findings can be used to inform policy changes to improve these students’ university experiences#FRE#
