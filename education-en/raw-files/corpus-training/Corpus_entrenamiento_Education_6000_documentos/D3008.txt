#ITI#Special Education Is Associated With Reduced Odds of School Discipline Among Students With Disabilities#FTI#
#IRE# Students with disabilities are disciplined at disproportionately high rates, despite federal laws designed to ensure disciplinary protection. We examine the association between disability and discipline using a novel approach, investigating whether behavior problems trigger special education referral, and if disciplinary outcomes change once students are enrolled. Using longitudinal data from an urban school district, we estimate lagged variance decomposition models that disaggregate the outcomes of special education services from the behavioral characteristics that prompt disciplinary responses. We find that (1) ongoing disruptive behavior leads to placement in special education and (2) receiving special education is associated with a reduced likelihood of punishment. Earlier identification is vital in order to treat, rather than punish, disruptive behavior#FRE#
