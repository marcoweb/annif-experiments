#ITI#Relationships between learning environments and self-efficacy in primary schools and differing perceptions of at-risk students#FTI#
#IRE#Because students who are considered to be at-risk of academic failure are more likely to experience a range of serious outcomes both at school and later in life, it is important for educators to provide a learning environment that supports these students. The aims of the study were two-fold. First, to better understand how educators might support students considered to be at-risk, we examined whether they perceived their learning environment and self-efficacy differently from their counterparts. Second, to provide insight into how teachers can improve their students’ self-efficacy, we investigated relationships between students’ perceptions of classroom environment and their self-efficacy. A survey was administered to a sample of 609 primary-school students in 31 classes. Practical insights from the results can assist teachers to create supportive learning environments that enhance self-efficacy and learning outcomes for all students, particularly those academically at-risk#FRE#
