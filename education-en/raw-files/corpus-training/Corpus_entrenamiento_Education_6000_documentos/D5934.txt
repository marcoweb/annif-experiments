#ITI#Equity and online work integrated learning: a qualitative research synthesis#FTI#
#IRE#Online Work Integrated Learning (WIL), where university students complete authentic work tasks for a remote workplace, is growing in prevalence, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Issues of equity in online WIL are underexplored, so we undertook a qualitative research synthesis of the literature to inform WIL provision for students from equity backgrounds. Our findings highlight the tendency to compare in-person to online WIL, rather than view it as its own unique form of learning. To make the most of online WIL, a structured, well-facilitated approach is needed, with meaningful work, clear communication, and regular feedback. There was a predisposition towards viewing online WIL as solely positive for students from equity backgrounds, with online WIL often seen as a solution to the many barriers that students from diverse backgrounds face in accessing in-person WIL. Nuanced discussions of equity were rare, and we highlight the need for further research in this area#FRE#
