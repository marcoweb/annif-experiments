#ITI#Sensemaking and Collective Sensemaking Within an Elementary Principal Science Network#FTI#
#IRE#School principals play a pivotal role in directing students’ classroom educational experiences. However, in the USA, many elementary principals (serving youth 5–12 years old) have had few formal experiences with professional development or coursework that centers on current standards for quality science instruction as guided by the Framework for K-12 Science Education. Thus, researchers need to understand the decisions being made that directly enhance or inhibit science instruction for youth. This study draws on sensemaking from organizational theory and social capital theory to explore sensemaking and collective sensemaking influence decision-making for science within an elementary science network. Findings from this study include elementary principals make decisions concerning science based on the knowledge they have, principal decision-making can be influenced by the network they draw on for information, and there are maintained beliefs that impede the decision-making elementary principals concerning science#FRE#
