#ITI#Learning strategies and reading achievement in primary schools: Longitudinal relationship and gender differences#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Learning is a self-regulated loop where learning strategies and achievements are interrelated. In reading, although some studies have explored the relationship between different learning strategies (memorization, elaboration and control) and reading achievement, little is known about how they interact over time. Even though the longitudinal relationship was revealed in some studies, most of the evidence was based on the whole population, regardless of gender differences. Aims: This study was designed to examine the longitudinal relationship between memorization, elaboration, control strategies and reading achievement, as well as the gender difference in the longitudinal relationship. Sample: The sample consisted of 3878 Chinese students (2025 boys, 1853 girls) who were surveyed in Grade 4 and Grade 6. Methods: A cross-lagged model was conducted to examine the longitudinal relationship between memorization, elaboration, control strategies and reading achievement while controlling for gender, age and parents' educational levels. Multigroup cross-lagged models were conducted to examine gender differences in the longitudinal relationship between these variables. Results: Memorization and elaboration strategies were reciprocally related. Both predicted subsequent control strategies, but not vice versa. Only memorization strategies positively predicted subsequent reading achievement, while prior reading achievement positively predicted the subsequent three strategies. The effects of prior reading achievement on subsequent learning strategies were stronger for boys. Conclusions: Memorization strategies play a prominent role in promoting deeper strategies and reading achievement in Chinese primary schools, which might relate to culture and developmental stages. Higher achievement or positive feedback from learning results might be motivation for using different strategies, especially for boys#FRE#
