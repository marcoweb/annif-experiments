#ITI#Supporting the uptake process with dialogic peer screencast feedback: a sociomaterial perspective#FTI#
#IRE#Screencast feedback has advantages over written feedback for supporting engagement and enactment, yet the potential of peer screencast feedback remains underexplored. This study took a small-scale (N = 8), in-depth, triangulated, qualitative approach to addressing this gap, adopting a socio-material lens to investigate the use of dialogic peer screencast feedback over an emergency remote semester. Screencast peer feedback was found to enhance depth, enabling expansion of written comments, focusing on ‘global’ aspects in screencasts and ‘local’ aspects in text. Using the feedback providers’ camera helped learners manage and process emotional impacts of feedback, encouraging uptake and supporting the development of a caring feedback community sustained through ongoing technology-mediated enactment-oriented dialogues. The results reveal various social and material factors ‘entangled’ with the emergence of agency and engagement in the feedback practices. The findings have significant implications for those teaching in online, hybrid, and blended conditions in the wake of the pandemic and beyond#FRE#
