#ITI#An exploration of hybrid instruction intentions amongst higher education teachers in post-Covid-19 times#FTI#
#IRE#This study used the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model to (i) predict factors influencing HE faculty members’ acceptance of hybrid instruction and (ii) identify factors influencing the faculty members’ behavioural intention to use hybrid instruction. Data were analysed using SPSS 22 and AMOS 23 software. Structural equation modelling techniques were used to analyse 114 data responses gathered online from faculty members. Results show that performance expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, regulators’ support and project team capability affected the behavioural intention of faculty members to use online teaching, whereas effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, price value and facilitating leadership did not. The results confirmed the direct impact of behavioural intention of faculty members on the use of online teaching. This research further extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology by introducing and validating three new constructs: facilitative leadership, regulatory support, and project team capability. The findings of the study add significant value to the acceptance of hybrid teaching among teachers, and informs how faculty members might be trained and supported#FRE#
