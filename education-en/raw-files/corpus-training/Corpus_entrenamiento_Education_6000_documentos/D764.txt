#ITI#Productive struggle and failing safely: implications for developing adaptive expertise in communication#FTI#
#IRE# Navigating difficult conversations is a complex task that requires flexible and adaptive approaches. Residents developing this skill may initially struggle or fail, and require support. However, this experience may prepare residents for future learning which is essential to adaptive expertise. Limited understanding of how residents learn from failure in the workplace restricts the ability to maximize its potential benefits. The purpose of this study was to explore the role failure plays in learning to navigate difficult conversations during workplace learning. A constructivist grounded theory study was conducted using semi-structured interviews of 13 physicians (subspecialty residents and newly graduated physicians) from a Division of Developmental Paediatrics between 2017 and 2018. The authors used constant comparative analysis to identify themes iteratively. Themes were identified both inductively and deductively using the conceptual framework of adaptive expertise. Through independently leading difficult conversations, physicians were able to recognize that the failure that occurred in these encounters, prompted them to generate new knowledge which led to deeper conceptual understanding, thus supporting development of adaptive expertise. However, participants indicated that staff physicians often protect residents from difficult conversations, which limits their opportunity to receive feedback and engage in learning. Residents participate in difficult conversations that challenge them to go beyond their existing knowledge. Providing residents with opportunity to lead difficult conversations with patients and families while being supported by staff supervisors, allows for struggling through learning, which leads to a deeper conceptual understanding and supports development of adaptive expertise#FRE#
