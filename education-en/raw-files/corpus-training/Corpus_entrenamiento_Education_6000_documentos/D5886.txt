#ITI#Contemplative, holistic eco-justice pedagogies in higher education: from anthropocentrism to fostering deep love and respect for nature#FTI#
#IRE#In this article, we directly address five of the six questions presented by Misiaszek & Rodrigues, including the definition of ‘sustainability’ and ‘development’ in higher education teaching, the politics of teaching, and the responsibilities of teachers within the institution of higher education. We argue for contemplative inquiry and storytelling as epistemology and pedagogy for eco-justice education. We introduce a course taught by an author of this paper, to illustrate our position on the possibilities of Justice-Based Ecological Pedagogies (JBES) as presented by Misiaszek & Rodrigues, as well as to frame our own position, and to offer practical, concrete examples of possible epistemologies and course pedagogies and activities grounded in an Anti-Anthropocentric pedagogical frame. We present a brief summary of student writing from this course, which we believe shows them meaningfully engaging with nature as a family member or friend, that is, a biocentric lens of love for nature#FRE#
