#ITI#Academic integrity graphic novel mini-cases#FTI#
#IRE#Academic integrity is a crucial aspect of the educational process, often receiving insufficient attention until a violation occurs. Researchers emphasize the importance of students comprehending academic integrity to foster ethical professionalism. However, there is a lack of resources available to effectively support these conversations. This study aims to assess academic integrity efficacy and the multi-dimensional ethical scale (MES) through the use of a graphic novel mini-case study. The analysis reveals a significant relationship between academic integrity efficacy, MES dimensions (moral equity, relativism and contractualism), and the case studies among undergraduate participants. The combination of quantitative and qualitative findings provides valuable insights into how graphic novel mini-cases can engage in academic integrity discussions with undergraduate students. The graphic novel mini-cases, along with their limitations and potential for future research, are provided. © The Author(s) 2024.#FRE#
