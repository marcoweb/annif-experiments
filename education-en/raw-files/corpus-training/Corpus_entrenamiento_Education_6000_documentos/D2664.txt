#ITI#Unleashing digital superheroes: Unravelling the empathy factor in digital competence and online teacher autonomy support#FTI#
#IRE# Considerable research has been dedicated to studying teachers' digital competence, yet limited insights have been gained regarding its impact on online teacher autonomy support. Based on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, this study utilized a multiple regression analysis model to explore how teachers' digital competence affects online teacher autonomy support. Drawing on data from 652 Chinese primary school teachers, the study revealed that teachers' digital competence positively influenced online teacher autonomy support via teachers' cognitive empathy. Teachers' emotional empathy strengthened the direct effect of cognitive empathy on online teacher autonomy support, and its indirect effect on teachers' digital competence on online teacher autonomy support. The findings inform TPACK framework development and practical considerations in online teaching, deepening understanding of the impact of digital competence on online teacher autonomy support.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Previous research has recognized the importance of teachers' digital competence in supporting learners' autonomy and enhancing their online learning experiences. Existing studies have explored different dimensions of teachers' digital competence, including technological proficiency, pedagogical knowledge and content expertise. Studies have also examined the role of empathy in online teaching and learning, emphasizing its importance in fostering positive teacher–student relationships and promoting student engagement and motivation. What this paper adds This study introduces digital competence as a novel and comprehensive assessment of technology integration in teaching, bridging an existing gap in the literature. This study recognizes the importance of socio-emotional skills in online teaching by including teachers' empathic traits within the expanded TPACK framework. Teachers' cognitive empathy acts as a mediator and emotional empathy functions as a moderator in the relationship between digital competence and online teacher autonomy support, offering new insights into the underlying mechanisms. Implications for practice and/or policy Teacher educators should find ways to support teachers' digital competence in facilitating learners' autonomy in online learning environments effectively. Teacher educators should incorporate teacher empathy development into teachers' professional development programmes for online teaching, offering tailored interventions to differentiate and enhance both cognitive and emotional empathy#FRE#
