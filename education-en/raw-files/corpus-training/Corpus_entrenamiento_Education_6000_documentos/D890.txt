#ITI#Student Perceptions Using Augmented Reality and 3D Visualization Technologies in Chemistry Education#FTI#
#IRE# Visualizing molecular conformations and complex compound structures and chemical transformations in 3D is one of the most difficult tasks for undergraduate chemistry students. Modern computational technologies have revolutionized every aspect of our lives, including education. As a result, many researchers and educators are working on enhancing student learning and improving construction of knowledge by employing technologies that better illustrate theoretical concepts, such as the visualization of molecular geometry in chemistry. Here, to aid students in understanding molecular structures and chemical reaction mechanisms at the molecular level, we initially developed several 3D animations of fundamental chemical transformations aimed at organic chemistry courses for second- and third-year undergraduate level. These animations became the basis for the 3D augmented reality tool called ARchemy. A comprehensive survey was conducted to gather student feedback on the effectiveness of these tools and their perception of the subject matter using these technologies, which will be presented in this project#FRE#
