#ITI#When Logics Collide: Implementing Technology-Enabled Personalization in the Age of Accountability#FTI#
#IRE# In this article, we situate the relatively new wave of technology-enabled personalized learning platforms within the broader policy context of institutional accountability. Although many education technology innovations were developed in response to heightened accountability pressures, technology-enabled personalization introduces new institutional rules, cultures, and norms that may be at odds with the goals of accountability. Using the adoption of a personalized, blended learning mathematics program at five U.S. schools as a case study, we describe how teachers, school leaders, and program staff navigated institutional pressures to improve state grade-level standardized test scores while implementing tasks and technologies designed to personalize student learning#FRE#
