#ITI#Action logs as mediational means for teacher development#FTI#
#IRE# In this narrative article, I document my implementation of action logs as a tool for reflective practice and teacher development as I transitioned from working in a small eikaiwa (English conversation) school to working in a private international university. After providing a brief description of my contextual background and how I came to start action logging, I give examples of student feedback I received and their relevance to my reflective teaching. Finally, I explain the varied ways in which I feel using action logs aided me in improving the efficacy of my classroom practice and influenced my evolving teacher identity during a stressful transition between two markedly different professional worlds.#FRE#
