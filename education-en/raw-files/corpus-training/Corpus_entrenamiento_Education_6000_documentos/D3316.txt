#ITI#ChatGPT in K-12 Education#FTI#
#IRE#There has been a great deal written about ChatGPT since its launch in late 2022. Many news stories specifically address the impact of ChatGPT on education. However, there has been little research showing what K-12 teachers are thinking about and doing with ChatGPT. This research article helps to fill that gap. A survey of Missouri teachers was conducted to hear from them about their experiences with and ideas for ChatGPT. Results indicate that teachers are concerned about the potential impact of ChatGPT on education, but many are looking for ways to effectively incorporate it into their classes. Finally, many educators are looking for support and professional development about how best to navigate this new technological landscape. © Association for Educational Communications & Technology 2023.#FRE#
