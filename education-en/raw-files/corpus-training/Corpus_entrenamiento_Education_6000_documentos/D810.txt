#ITI#Integrating simulation and interpretive description to explore operating room leadership: critical event continuing education#FTI#
#IRE# In Obstetrics and Gynecologic operating room emergencies, the surgeon cannot both operate and lead a suddenly expanded and redirected team response. However, one of the most often used approaches to interprofessional continuing education designed to improve teams’ ability to respond to unanticipated critical events still emphasizes surgeon leadership. We developed Explicit Anesthesia and Nurse Distributed (EXPAND) Leadership to imagine a workflow that might better distribute emergency leadership task responsibilities and practices. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate teams’ responses to distributing leadership during an interprofessional continuing education simulated obstetrical emergency. We used interpretive descriptive design in a secondary analysis of teams’ post-simulation reflective debriefings. One-hundred sixty providers participated, including OB-Gyn surgeons, anesthesiologists, CRNAs, scrub technicians, and nurses. Using reflective thematic analysis, we identified three core themes: 1) The surgeon is focused on the surgical field, 2) Explicit leadership initiates a nurse transition from follower to leader in a hierarchical environment, and 3) Explicit distributed leadership enhances teamwork and taskwork. Continuing education which uses distributed leadership to improve teams’ ability to respond to an obstetric emergency is perceived to enhance team members’ response to the critical event. The potential for nurses’ career growth and professional transformation was an unexpected finding associated with this continuing education which used distributed leadership. Our findings suggest that healthcare educators should consider ways in which distributed leadership may improve teams’ response to critical events in the operating room#FRE#
