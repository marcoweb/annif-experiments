#ITI#Racial Identity and Historical Narratives in the Civic Engagement of Black Emerging Adults#FTI#
#IRE#Civic engagement is important for individual and collective development, and may serve as a means of collective agency for Black people. However, few studies have examined culture-specific factors that promote civic engagement among Black populations. In the current study, we use survey data to examine how racial identity dimensions (racial centrality and regard) and experience with Blacks’ historical narratives as measured by Black consciousness, Black history knowledge, and Black Studies courses relate to time spent involved in civic activities among 330 Black emerging adults (ages 18 – 29). We found that racial centrality, Black consciousness, and Black Studies courses were significantly associated with civic engagement but regard (public and private) and Black history knowledge were not statistically significant. There was also evidence that Black consciousness or the importance of Blacks’ historical narratives partially mediated the relationship between racial centrality and civic engagement. Additionally, there were group differences in civic engagement by the number of Black Studies courses participants had taken. The present findings contribute to our understanding of how culture-specific factors may be related to civic engagement among Black emerging adults. Findings are discussed in terms of study limitations and future direction#FRE#
