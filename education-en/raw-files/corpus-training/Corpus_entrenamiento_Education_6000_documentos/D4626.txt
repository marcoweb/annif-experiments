#ITI#Flipped learning design fidelity, self-regulated learning, satisfaction, and continuance intention in a university flipped learning course#FTI#
#IRE#For effective flipped learning, beyond simply switching the sequence of lectures and homework, it is important to understand and implement the fundamental design principles of flipped learning. A new notion is proposed called flipped learning design fidelity, defined as the degree to which a class is faithfully designed to be close to an ideal flipped learning class operationalised with four proxy indicators of the F-L-I-P™ model (flexible environment, learning culture, intentional content, and professional educator). This study empirically examines the effect of both learner-related factor (self-regulated learning) and design-related factor (design fidelity) on learning outcomes (satisfaction, continuance intention) in a university flipped course. We hypothesised that flipped learning design fidelity and self-regulated learning affect student satisfaction and intention to continue participating in a flipped learning course. The participants were 134 Korean students of a university course taught in a flipped learning mode. The results revealed that the level of flipped learning design fidelity had a significant effect on satisfaction, but did not affect continuance intention. In addition, the level of self-regulated learning had a significant effect on satisfaction and continuance intention. Drawn from the key findings, we suggest implications for the design of flipped learning courses in a university context. Implications for practice: • Instructional designers and instructors can apply the concept of flipped learning design fidelity to fully implement the four pillars of the F-L-I-P™ model. • Self-regulated students are likely to be satisfied with flipped learning and want to continue taking flipped learning courses#FRE#
