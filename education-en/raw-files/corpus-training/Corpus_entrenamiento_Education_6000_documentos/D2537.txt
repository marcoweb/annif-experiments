#ITI#What affects the continued learning about energy? Evidence from a 4-year longitudinal study#FTI#
#IRE# Energy is a central concept across the sciences and an important goal of science education is to support all students so that they develop a full understanding of the energy concept. However, given the abstract and complex nature of the energy concept, only a few students develop an understanding so that they can use energy ideas to make sense of phenomena. Research into energy learning progressions aims at developing models of learning about energy to guide instruction so that students can be best supported in developing competence and has provided a rich model of how students' understanding of energy develops over time. Being largely based on cross-section data, however, the extent to which this model can guide instruction is limited, especially concerning the continued learning of students about energy. To address this gap—the limited evidence regarding what supports students' continued learning about energy—it was investigated how holding non-normative ideas and the integratedness of students' energy knowledge affect students' continued learning about energy. Drawing on data from a 4-year longitudinal study covering Grades 6–9 on students' learning about energy, diagnostic classification models were used to characterize students' non-normative idea profiles and the integratedness of their knowledge and then related both to their continued learning. The results suggest no detrimental effects of holding non-normative ideas and strong positive effects of holding integrated knowledge for students' continued learning about energy. Implications for teaching and future research are discussed#FRE#
