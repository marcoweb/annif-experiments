#ITI#The lived experiences of health science graduate students with anxiety and depression#FTI#
#IRE#Health science graduate programs are intensive experiences in students’ lives which can contribute to perceived symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. The consequent impact of these symptoms can have an overall effect on the graduate students’ ability to participate in their daily lives, along with their program of study. The purpose of this study was to understand the lived experiences of health science graduate students who experience perceived signs and symptoms of anxiety and/or depression. An open-ended, qualitative phenomenological survey was used to understand the experiences of 56 Doctor of Occupational Therapy, Doctor of Physical Therapy, and Doctor of Pharmacy students at a university in the southeastern United States. Three themes were identified from the data: the cyclic effect of symptoms and triggers; the importance of support systems; and the benefit of coping skill utilization. Future research is needed to understand the effects of preventive and rehabilitative measures to address health science graduate students’ mental health#FRE#
