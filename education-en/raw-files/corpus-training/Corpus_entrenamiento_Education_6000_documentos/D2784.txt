#ITI#Relations Among Phonological Processing Skills and Mathematics in Children: A Meta-Analysis#FTI#
#IRE# The present study presents a meta-analysis of the relations between phonological processing abilitiesand different mathematics subskills. Using a random-effects model with 94 studies (135 unique samples,826 effect sizes), the present meta-analysis revealed a significant general association between phonologicalprocessing and mathematics (average r =.33, p <.001, 95% CI [.30,.36]). Phonological awareness(PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN) showed stronger correlations with mathematics than phonologicalmemory (PM) did. The correlations among phonological processing abilities and mathematicsskills were generally stronger among younger children than among older children. PA and PM manifestedlarger effect sizes when correlated with mathematics accuracy than with mathematics fluency,whereas RAN yielded larger effect sizes when associated with mathematics fluency than with mathematicsaccuracy. Metastructural equation modeling results revealed that, after statistically controlling fordomain-general abilities (i.e., vocabulary knowledge, executive functioning, and nonverbal intelligence),phonological processing still made a unique contribution to different mathematics subskills (βs =.20 ~.54). These results suggest that children may use phonological processing abilities as one mechanismthrough which to represent, manipulate, and retrieve mathematics knowledge#FRE#
