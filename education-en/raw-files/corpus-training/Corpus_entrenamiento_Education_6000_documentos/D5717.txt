#ITI#Teaching for all: profile of faculty members who facilitate the success and inclusion of students with disability#FTI#
#IRE#The presence of students with disability in university classrooms is a current reality, which implies the need to develop inclusive teaching practices. The purpose of this study was to analyze the beliefs, attitudes, and characteristics of faculty members towards students with disability. A total of 42 participants were recruited since they had been previously selected as inclusive faculty members by students with disability. All participants taught at the faculties of education and belonged to 6 Spanish public universities. The biographic-narrative methodology was used, and the analysis of the data was defined by its narrative nature. The results indicate that the majority of faculty members are either from the social model of disability or from inclusive education approaches. They value their attitude towards students with disabilities as positive. Among their personal characteristics, empathy, closeness, involvement, and vocation are highlighted; and regarding their professional characteristics, they point out their commitment to their work, flexibility, the use of participative methodologies, or their role as a guide in the teaching and learning process, among others. These results have clear implications for teacher training plans with the aim of promoting inclusive pedagogy in higher education#FRE#
