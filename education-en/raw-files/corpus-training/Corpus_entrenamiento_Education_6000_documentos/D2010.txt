#ITI#Theorising on covid-19 educational emergency: magnifying glasses for the field of educational technology#FTI#
#IRE# The Covid-19 pandemic has brought challenges to the educational system on micro, meso or macro levels. In this article, we posit that the current emergency augmented, what we call the meso space, while at the same time representing a sort of magnifying glass to observe and examine how distance education tools, practices and new forms of collaboration can emerge within the patterns of re-organising. This article focuses on the meaning of the Covid-19 emergency-related changes in the field of educational technologies from a theoretical and practical perspective. While the article mainly represents a theoretical contribution, the main conclusions are derived from, illustrated and substantiated with an ethnographic case study based on Italian teacher online communities. As a result, while this article proposes much-needed theorising in the field of educational technologies during the Covid-19 crisis, it also brings insights into the practice with EdTech tools and teacher professional development#FRE#
