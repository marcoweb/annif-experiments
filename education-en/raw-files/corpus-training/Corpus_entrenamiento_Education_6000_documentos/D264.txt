#ITI#Presence as Policy Action: Black Mothers as Policy Actors Navigating Antiblack Geopolitics#FTI#
#IRE# Antiblack geopolitics and educational policies continue to produce oppressive systems, making it difficult for educators to acknowledge Black families’ actions as contributions to produce equitable education. Policy processes have the potential to transform oppressive systems of power. Conceptualizing policy as a practice of power permits local policy actors to use their individualized power to shift a policy’s course of action and transform oppressive educational systems. With an anticolonial framework and using an institutional ethnography, this inquiry explores Black mothers’ actions as policy actors. Findings detail the mothers’ relentless invitation to allow their darkskinned agentic power to collaborate with their school district and form a teacher-recruitment program. The mothers’ policy actions are exemplary of the abilities to transform policy processes ridden with antiblack geopolitics that ignore the voices of BIPOC individuals. This project illustrates the daily antiblackness individuals endure before and while enlisting as educational partners and policy actors.#FRE#
