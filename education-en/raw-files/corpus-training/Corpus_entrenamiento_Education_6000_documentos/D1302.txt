#ITI#Constructing problems in context: a synthesized model of dialectical problem-framing#FTI#
#IRE# The goal of this article is to propose a framework for understanding the nature of how people construct problems by interacting with situations and subsequently to offer implications for instructional design and future research. We propose that people must interactively frame the components of a situation in order to establish the meaning of a problem to solve. Although this interactive meaning-making process is critical to real-world problem solving, little research has been devoted to understanding the nature of interactive problem-framing or how to support students in framing problems effectively. Therefore, in this paper, we attempt to approach problem-framing from the perspective of cognitive theories focused on situated interactivity and propose a synthesized conceptual model based on the interaction of agents and context. We argue that solving a real-world problem involves a process of building it (the problem) by interactively shaping distributed situational resources into structures of meaning aimed towards the resolution of perceived contradictions. Using the key elements of the model, we also propose opportunities for future empirical research and possible implications for instructional design that can help facilitate the development of studentsâ€™ abilities to meaningfully frame problems#FRE#
