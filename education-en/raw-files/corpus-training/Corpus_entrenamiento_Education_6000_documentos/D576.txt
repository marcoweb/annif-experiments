#ITI#In Between the Lines: Black and Brown Adolescents Creating a Homeplace Across School Settings#FTI#
#IRE# This study examined the identity resources available to Black and Brown students who play football across space in their school, and how the resources were used to navigate situations of race, racism and identity. Natural conversations and participant observations detailed experiences, identities, and resistance as they moved through spaces within their school environment. Sociocultural learning theories frame their experiences through composite space narratives. Reframing what constitutes learning, who's considered an educator and what are considered educational spaces is necessary. Findings provide implications for identities being supported across space and the role of football coaches in facilitating learning.#FRE#
