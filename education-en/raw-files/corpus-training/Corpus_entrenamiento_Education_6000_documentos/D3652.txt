#ITI#The who, how and why of choosing post-16 computing curricula: a case study of English further education colleges#FTI#
#IRE#Given the evolving and diverse nature of post-16 computing curricula within England, this papers’ primary objective was to identify the factors which influence the decision-making processes for education providers when choosing computing curricula. As a main provider of the vast array of post-16 qualifications, and due to their neglect both politically and in research, further education colleges were chosen as the subject of inquiry. Due to the focus on understanding employee perspectives, a qualitative research method was employed where semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirty-two employees from across thirteen colleges within England. These employees included computing lecturers, heads of departments, and members of senior leadership. Findings indicate the extent of the range of post-16 computing qualifications offered by colleges, in addition to identifying who the key players are for computing curricula decisions. Additionally, ten factors were identified as pivotal to influencing curricula choice, and from these factors, a model has been created classifying four central areas that should be considered regarding curriculum choice: labour market information, qualification relevance to industry needs, qualification attractiveness, and current college resources. This model should help inform education providers in making more informed computing curricula decisions#FRE#
