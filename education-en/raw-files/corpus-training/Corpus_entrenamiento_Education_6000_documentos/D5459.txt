#ITI#Relative Effects of Classroom Utility Value Intervention on the Science Motivation of Girls and Boys#FTI#
#IRE#Emerging evidence attests to the need to intervene in young students’ science motivation and achievement before their science motivation starts to dwindle. Heeding this call, we implemented a science utility value intervention for fifth and sixth graders in 23 classrooms (N = 550). Through five intervention sessions that consisted of diverse individual and group activities including writing, students learned and internalized the personal and communal usefulness of science for 14 popular non-STEM professions as well as their own aspired future careers. After the intervention, the students in the experimental condition perceived greater utility value of science, were more interested and self-efficacious in their science classes, expressed greater appreciation of the role science played in their future careers, and aspired to science-related careers more strongly than the students in the control condition. The intervention was especially effective for improving the personal utility value, appreciation, and science-related career intention of girls. The advantage of the experimental group in science interest and self-efficacy, compared to the control group that received a delayed intervention, was maintained till the end of the semester. The findings provide important empirical and practical insights into designing effective science interventions for young learners#FRE#
