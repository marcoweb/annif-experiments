#ITI#Degree of autonomy in making independent choices by frail older people with intellectual disabilities in a care home: A descriptive ethnographic study#FTI#
#IRE#Background: We aimed to gain more insight into autonomy of older people with intellectual disabilities in a residential care facility in making choices. Methods: We performed a descriptive ethnographic study in a residential facility in the Netherlands for 22 persons, aged 54–89 years, with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities (IQ <70) and low social–emotional development levels. We combined participant observations and qualitative interviews. Results: Based on the observations, the main themes for the interviews were established. Residents indicated to be free to make independent choices, and experienced less autonomy with regard to health issues and finances. Support staff stated that residents' level of autonomy depends on residents' characteristics, needs, preferences, the attitude of support staff and the rules of the care institution. Conclusion: Residents had a clear view on their autonomy in making independent choices. Support staff is mindful of preserving residents' autonomy, which in practice is limited#FRE#
