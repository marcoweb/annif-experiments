#ITI#Nonlinear Pedagogy and its implications for practice in the Singapore PE context#FTI#
#IRE# Background: Nonlinear Pedagogy, underpinned by concepts in ecological dynamics, is a pedagogical framework that advocates an exploratory approach to acquisition of movement skills with an emphasis on individualised movement solutions. Its key principles have been successfully implemented in sports teaching and coaching and are currently being applied to learning designs in PE programmes. Purposes: The purposes of the paper are to provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings and practical implications of Nonlinear Pedagogy (NLP) for Physical Education (PE). To exemplify applications of key concepts, we discuss how NLP is being implemented as a methodological framework for learning design in PE programmes of Singapore schools. For simplicity, our analysis focuses on the ‘What’, ‘Why’ and ‘How’ of NLP to illustrate its application in Singapore PE programmes. Discussion: Understanding the ‘What’ and ‘Why’ of NLP can provide a sound foundation to understand how this pedagogical framework can be applied in formalised school PE settings. While it is important for teachers to know what NLP is, the ‘Why’ of NLP, referencing its effectiveness as a pedagogical approach, can provide a rationale for its adoption to enhance teaching and learning. The ‘How’ of NLP’s practical implementation in Singapore schools is of primary interest for teachers, managers, administrators and policy makers in education. Conclusion: The article discusses key pedagogical principles from NLP, which can provide a platform for teachers to design effective lessons and practices to enhance learning in PE programmes. An important practical implication of the current paper is to provide educators with guidance and training for incorporating pedagogical principles of NLP in lessons and learning programmes to enhance ‘nonlinearization’ of some current practices#FRE#
