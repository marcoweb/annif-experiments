#ITI#Fostering (Re)Connections: South Asian Students Healing From Dating Violence#FTI#
#IRE#College students who experience dating violence (DV) often report detrimental impacts to their academic, social, and personal lives that influence their retention and persistence in higher education (e.g., Wood et al., 2020). To address the negative impacts of DV, higher education leaders and practitioners must focus on promoting healing among college students. Further, the current scarce racial analysis in campus DV research, policy, and practice necessitates an analysis of the experiences of survivors of color. By understanding the healing journeys of South Asian student DV survivors, professionals, policy-makers, and researchers can better support survivors in thriving in higher education. Thus, the purpose of this qualitative study is to understand the healing experiences of South Asian college student DV survivors in support of institutional efforts to respond effectively to interpersonal violence. This study uses the decolonial Par/Des(i) framework (Bhattacharya, 2019), along with culturally situated methods, to explore the healing modalities of six South Asian women students at one institution of higher education. Participants engaged in two thé talks, similar to semistructured interviews, and a photovoice activity which centered their healing journeys. Using a critical qualitative approach, data analysis of participants’ narratives demonstrated five connections that supported their healing from their experiences of DV: intergenerational connections, peer connections, connections to formal resources, connections with nature, and (re)connections with oneself. Findings highlight the need to incorporate culturally resonant healing modalities in institutional policies and services and to center minoritized students’ experiences in campus interpersonal violence research and practic#FRE#
