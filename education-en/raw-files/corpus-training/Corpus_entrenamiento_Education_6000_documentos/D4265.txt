#ITI#Sovereign and pseudo-hosts: The politics of hospitality for negotiating culturally nourishing schools#FTI#
#IRE#Since contact, there has been a foundation of inhospitable interactions between the original sovereign peoples of the Australian continent and Eurpoean arrivals. Despite government policies appearing to shift from assimilative practices to reconciliation processes in the latter half of the 20th Century, ongoing interactions continue to be factious, caught up in discourses of power/knowledge, and, perhaps provocatively, couched primarily in misunderstandings. In the Australian schooling space, while there has been increased attention paid to the academic success of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander students, and greater inclusion of their families, communities, and cultural practices, non-Indigenous led schools continue to be hamstrung by their epistemic inertia – the cognitive inability to move beyond the fear of getting it wrong, offending, or being labelled racist. In this paper, we argue that the major impediment to ongoing and unresolved discord is concealed in the onto-epistemological foundation of what it means to respect, accept, and work with. To address this, we take up Welcoming to Country practices and Derrida’s concept of hospitality to interrogate how more nuanced conceptualisations of reciprocity may be used to move beyond performative acts of reconciliation. The outcome of which may be a reimagining of practices that are relational and responsive for embracing and nourishing Indigenous cultures and languages#FRE#
