#ITI#Views on the Nature of Science, Beliefs, Trust in the Government, and COVID-19 Pandemic Preventive Behavior among Undergraduate Students#FTI#
#IRE#The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous setbacks in the different sectors of society until today (as of writing) including higher education institutions worldwide. Nevertheless, it also created opportunities to explore different aspects of pandemic prevention and preparedness. Specifically, this study attempted to explore predictors of COVID-19 pandemic preventive behavior including Views on the Nature of Science, belief on COVID-19 pandemic, and trust in the government among undergraduate students in one of the state universities in the Philippines. Following the survey research design, 389 undergraduate students answered a questionnaire whose items were adapted from literature. Data collected were analyzed through partial least squares–structural equation modeling using Smart PLS. The analysis allowed simultaneous assessment of measurement validity and reliability and hypotheses testing. Results showed that Views on the Nature of Science and belief on COVID-19 pandemic predicted COVID-19 pandemic preventive behavior. However, these two variables did not predict trust in the government nor did trust in the government predicted COVID-19 pandemic preventive behavior. A reflection on socio-scientific issues and the role of Views on the Nature of Science, synergy of beliefs, and public trust, science, and COVID-19 pandemic preventive behavior are provided#FRE#
