#ITI#The experiences of mothers of children and young people with intellectual disabilities during the first COVID-19 lockdown period#FTI#
#IRE#Background: Recent COVID-19 lockdown restrictions resulted in reduced access to educational, professional and social support systems for children with intellectual disabilities and their carers. Aim: The aim of this study was to gain insight into the ways mothers of children with intellectual disabilities coped during the first 2020 lockdown period. Methods: Eight mothers of children with intellectual disabilities were interviewed. The recordings of these interviews were subjected to a thematic analysis. Results: Three main themes were identified: carrying the burden; a time of stress; and embracing change and looking to the future. Conclusions: All mothers experienced increased burden and stress. However, some also described some positive impact of lockdown conditions on them as well as on their child's well-being and behaviour. These findings are discussed in the light of the (Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities, 33, 2020, 1523) survey results on parental coping and suggestions for future service provision during pandemic conditions are proposed#FRE#
