#ITI#From Complacency to Criticality: Envisioning Antiracist Leadership Among White Higher Education Administrators#FTI#
#IRE#A bevy of recent incidents at colleges and universities across the nation have underscored that legacies of white supremacy continue to manifest in both overt and subtle ways. From Mizzou and Michigan to Cornell and Drake, contemporary manifestations of white supremacy are not limited to a particular geographic region or institutional type. Fallout from how these institutions’ leaders, mostly White men, have managed such concerns plagues both the students and campus life. Although these events can serve as an opportunity to advance conversations regarding systemic oppression and social change, many [White] higher education administrators are left perplexed about how to address the realities of white supremacy on their campuses. Utilizing Critical Whiteness Studies (CWS) as a theoretical lens, we conceptualize antiracist leadership by offering four recommendations White administrators should consider in order to advance antiracist, antioppressive forms of leadership#FRE#
