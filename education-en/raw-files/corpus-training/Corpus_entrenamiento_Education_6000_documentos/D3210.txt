#ITI#A Research-Practice Partnership Approach for Co-Designing a Culturally Responsive Computer Science Curriculum for Upper Elementary Students#FTI#
#IRE#Implementing computer science education in an elementary classroom is at the forefront of computing education. Nevertheless, the literature on K-12 Computer Science (CS) education offers limited guidance for developing elementary CS curricula that lead to multiple career paths through project-based learning. Particularly, more research is needed on culturally responsive elementary school computing that leverages students’ cultural references to create a more equitable CS education that acknowledges one’s identity, culture, or background in the curriculum planning. This paper offers an approach for designing culturally responsive computing for upper elementary students from a highly diverse, low socio-economic school district using a research-practice approach. The approach can be adapted for other schools that face unique diversity and curricular challenges#FRE#
