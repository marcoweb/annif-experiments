#ITI#Addressing challenges with Ukrainian refugees through sustainable integration: response of the educational community in Poland#FTI#
#IRE#The impact of the war on higher education and research in Ukraine is devastating. A great many teachers, researchers and students had to flee ruined universities and research centres. Numerous universities worldwide have demonstrated solidarity with Ukrainian refugees. In an effort to develop effective support strategies, this study identifies specifics of migration from Ukraine caused by the war. The questionnaire was developed to conduct a survey among 26 Ukrainian faculties recently employed at the University of Information Technology and Management in Rzeszow (Poland). Respondents reported great satisfaction with integration strategies based on perfect intra-university collaboration and comprehensive individual approach. Four groups of challenges that can be influenced by an intervention at nation-wide, local and institutional levels were identified and then addressed in terms of empirical considerations, firsthand experience and survey findings#FRE#
