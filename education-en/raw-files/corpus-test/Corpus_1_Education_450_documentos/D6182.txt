#ITI#Strategies for Sisterhood in the Language Education Academy#FTI#
#IRE#Almost 20 years after the publication of our co-authored article in a leading North American academic journal, seven female language education academics revisit our evolving analysis of the complex spaces occupied by women of color in the language education academy. We expand on the particularities of our place-based struggles and ask questions about how conditions in the academy and the world have changed for us as female and racially minoritized scholars over the past dozen years. Over the years, we have sought to cultivate strategic and analytic expertise that might enable us to thrive in the academy without compromising our political stance nor our integrity. We share the stories of our experiences in the form of strategies for solidarity, feminism, and antiracism in the academy, asking how racially minoritized women can carve out productive lives in the academy without taking on dominant ideologies of self-interest, self-promotion, exploitation, competitiveness, individualism, and neoliberalism#FRE#
