#ITI#Analysis of Physics Textbooks Through the Lens of Inquiry Practices#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study is to analyze the learning goals, nature of science, inquiry skills, understanding of inquiry, and inquiry types in the senior high school physics textbooks in Indonesia. We selected the textbooks based on three criteria: (1) approved by the Ministry of Education and Culture in Indonesia, (2) widely used in senior high schools, and (3) included content and practices based on the current curriculum. Content analysis was used to analyze 10th, 11th, and 12th grade textbooks. We found that more physics topics focused on the cognitive than on the epistemic, affective, and sociocultural aspects in these textbooks. The findings show that nature of science was emphasized in the textbooks, but they were more focused on science as a cognitive-epistemic system. Furthermore, we found that structured inquiry was more emphasized than confirmed and guided inquiry. Finally, structured inquiry focused more on inquiry skills than on the understanding of inquiry in all three textbooks, while observing and communicating skills were more emphasized in the physics activities. It is suggested that more studies need to develop inquiry activities that focus on understanding inquiry#FRE#
