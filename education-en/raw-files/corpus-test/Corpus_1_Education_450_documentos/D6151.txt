#ITI#Multilingualism and Reading Identities in Prekindergarten: Young Children Connecting Reading, Language, and the Self#FTI#
#IRE#Reading identities, or the ways that a child constructs the self as a reader across contexts and time, play a role in the development of early reading. Prior research on reading identities has reported primarily on the identities of monolingual children. This multiple case study examines the reading identities of young multilingual children. Participants were 10 four- and five-year-old multilingual children from two prekindergarten classrooms in the United States: one monolingual English classroom and one classroom where English and Spanish were used for instruction. Data were gathered using child-centered interviews, child and classroom observations, teacher interviews, and a family questionnaire. A cross-case analysis led to the identification of three aspects of early reading identities connected to multilingualism. These show the ways that young multilingual children construct concepts of the self as reader that are responsive to the experience of being multilingual#FRE#
