#ITI#Navigating Potential Conflicting Identities: Identification Processes among Minority Youths in Portugal#FTI#
#IRE#This qualitative study investigates the discursive construction of Santomean identity grounded in the migratory experience of youths who moved to Portugal to pursue their studies. It is based on semistructured interviews with young Santomeans living in Central Portugal. Santomeans typically identify as both native speakers of Portuguese and Black Africans, but once in Portugal, this identity is challenged by Portuguese who may perceive them as linguistically deficient. This article focuses on the ways young Santomeans position themselves and others, and the identity choices they make in doing so. Findings suggest that the distance between Black and white youths is reinforced by the teachers’ and students’ practices in class. These young Santomeans navigate raciolinguistic ideologies, engage in processes of identification, and draw on linguistic, social, and racial categories to redefine their identities. Although the process of identity formation is multi-layered, the data indicate that the most fundamental category remains race#FRE#
