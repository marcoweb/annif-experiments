#ITI#Everything is more difficult when you are different: analysis of the experiences of homosexual students in Physical Education#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this research is to analyse the experiences of seven homosexual students (four boys and three girls) in Physical Education (PE). Their families are also involved in the study, looking in depth at how their children’s experiences have affected their daily lives throughout their adolescence. A qualitative approach is used, exploring the students’ and families’ perceptions from an analytic approach called ‘thinking with theory’ (Jackson & Mazzei, [2012]. Thinking with theory in qualitative research: Viewing data across multiple perspectives. Routledge), with which we try to highlight the networked functioning connections and tensions between some basic ideas of gender performativity theory and the data obtained from the experiences of the students and their families. The data collection instruments used are interviews with the participants and discussion groups with their families. The results show how the construction and reinforcement of gender roles and stereotypes in PE lead them to reject the subject in many cases. They show how, on many occasions, their role is relegated to the background, presenting certain fears and insecurities about taking the initiative in activities. In some cases, the relationship with their peers is clearly limited, receiving gestures of mockery and insults from others. The families admit to having suffered a lot at certain times during their children’s schooling. They explain that there is still a long way to go to achieve true acceptance and inclusion in PE #FRE#
