#ITI#Más allá de la lengua: Embracing the Messiness as Bilingual Teacher Educators#FTI#
#IRE#Using testimonios as counterstories, we—a Latina/Indigenous immigrant and white U.S. male—examine our professional trajectories while noting changes that shaped our identities as educators and researchers within a bilingual teacher preparation program. The dual purpose of this paper is (a) to highlight our struggles as bilingual teacher educators to change both our own practices and those of our institutions in preparing future bilingual teachers to be politically engaged agents of change and (b) to connect our two experiences to advance the conversation around language ideologies, pedagogies, and activism among bilingual teacher educators#FRE#
