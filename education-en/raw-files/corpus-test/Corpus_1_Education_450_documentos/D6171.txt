#ITI#A Language-Based Approach to Content Instruction (LACI) for Multilingual Learners: Six Cs of Scaffolding in First Grade#FTI#
#IRE#Teacher discourse is one way to scaffold instruction for students and is especially important for multilingual learners (MLs). With an ever-growing population of MLs, this topic demands attention. This study takes steps to meet this demand by presenting a language-based approach to content instruction (LACI), a guiding framework comprised of six scaffolding elements that teachers can use to support their MLs during classroom instruction. Using an in-depth case study, we explored how a first-grade teacher used the LACI framework to support her linguistically and culturally diverse students in their development of academic language and access to English language arts content. Demonstrating overall positive findings, the framework provided her with various scaffolding moves to facilitate learning and to validate students’ unique cultural and linguistic resources. This study contributes initial findings vis-à-vis this framework and showcases practical implications for both elementary teachers and teacher educators#FRE#
