#ITI#Teaching and Learning Chinese as a Foreign Language Through Intercultural Online Collaborative Projects#FTI#
#IRE#This study explores project-based online intercultural collaborative learning for non-native beginners’ CFL learning (Chinese as a Foreign Language) in Denmark. Adopting a quasi-experimental design, two parallel classes were involved in the study wherein the same learning contents and project-based learning was used in both. An additional element of collaborative online learning with Chinese students facilitated to only the experimental class. The study empirically adopted a sequential mixed-method design, including quantitive data from knowledge test and project product assessment and qualitative data from the communicative records and semi-structured interviews. While results reported no difference regarding knowledge test outcomes between the two classes, and both classes performed well in their project work, experimental class students performed better than the control class in project outcomes. The results indicate that the PBL method has a positive effect on CFL beginners. While the online intercultural collaborative elements may not make a difference for the knowledge learning aspect, it supports the students’ deep understanding of the target culture theory and a micro-setting life experiences, which may support the CFL learning at a beginning level. Suggestions are provided based on identified challenges regarding how to better support project-based online intercultural collaborative learning, including balancing group work and individual support for CFL beginners, more time allocation to support team dynamics, and better use of technological tools#FRE#
