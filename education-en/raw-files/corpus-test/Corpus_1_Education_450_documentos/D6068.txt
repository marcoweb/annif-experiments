#ITI#The senses/sensing relationship in physical literacy: generating a worldly (re)enchantment for physical education#FTI#
#IRE#In this article, we entangle Margaret Whitehead’s physical literacy (PL) that promotes intrinsically derived movement ethics in Physical Education (PE), with Alfred North Whitehead’s process philosophy of speculative empiricism to promote relationally derived movement practices in PE. Troubling neoliberal governance that positions the individual in linear trajectories of autonomous, independent, individualized, and self-determined agency, our goal in this article is to conceptualize PL within ideas of relational agency that is inherent in moment-to-moment movement encounters. We take up cartographic and diffractive storytelling in poems interspersed throughout the text, to show how we, as a researcher/teacher in PE, (re)emerged as humans-in relation with the world through the senses/sensing relationship enacting continual, dynamic, and reiterative becoming-withs. As bodies and movement are no longer seen as separate and detached, questions change from definitions of PL, or how to ‘obtain’ PL, to a focus on how movement does relationships. This has vast implications for PL, because through affective, aesthetic, sensory, and nonrational ways of moving, PL is actualized in ways that are contextualised, emplaced, and specific to the child’s (micro) politics of location. In turn, this provides the conditions of possibility for a worldly (re)enchantment in PE#FRE#
