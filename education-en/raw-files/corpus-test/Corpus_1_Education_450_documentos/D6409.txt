#ITI#The Mediating Role of Classroom Climate and Student Self-Efficacy in the Relationship Between Teacher Leadership Style and Student Academic Motivation: Evidence from China#FTI#
#IRE#This study aimed to develop a model illustrating how teacher leadership contributes to student learning in higher education settings in the Eastern world. Specifically, the current study examined the relationship between teacher leadership style, classroom climate, student self-efficacy, and academic motivation. Four hundred and forty-six randomly selected undergraduate students from four medical universities in China participated in this study. PLS-SEM analyses revealed that teacher leadership style had a significant and positive effect on academic motivation. Findings also showed that classroom climate and student self-efficacy significantly mediated the association between teacher leadership style and academic motivation. Apart from contributing to the theoretical understanding of how teacher leadership impacts student learning, this research provides insightful references for medical teachers, policymakers, and stakeholders#FRE#
