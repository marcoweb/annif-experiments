#ITI#Re-Thinking Monologicality: Multi-Voiced, Mono-Perspectival Classroom Discourses#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study is to conceptually explore and investigate the attributes of varying monologic discourses in the classroom, in order to develop a more nuanced understanding of monologicality. Data for this study comprised transcripts of lessons conducted by a teacher from a larger national study on Year 7 classroom practices. Constant comparative analysis of these lessons revealed a continuum of monologicality involving different variants of monologic discourses that arose from the decoupling of voice and perspective. Along this continuum, there are varying configurations of voice and perspective: ranging from mono-voiced, mono-perspectival discourse to multi-voiced, mono-perspectival discourse. This can potentially provide a bridge to the dialogic side of the continuum, where multi-voiced, multi-perspectival discourse is represented. This conceptual framework provides a basis to examine teaching and classroom discourse along this continuum. Further interrogation using this framework can inform teaching practice, future classroom discourse research, as well as teacher education curriculum#FRE#
