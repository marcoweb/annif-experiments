#ITI#Gender-Related Differences in the Effects of Motivation, Self-Efficacy, and Emotions on Autonomous Use of Technology in Second Language Learning#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of our paper is to explore the predictor variables of autonomous use of technology (Benson, 2011) in relation to second language learning. To this end, we explored motivated learning behavior (Dörnyei & Ushioda, 2021), self-efficacy (Bandura, 1986) and several language learning-related emotions, such as enjoyment, pride, hope, curiosity, confusion, anxiety, shame, boredom, and apathy (Albert et al., 2021) in our quantitative study. Our research questions concerned the investigation of gender differences in addition to exploring relationships between the constructs analyzed. Our standardized questionnaire was completed by 1,152 secondary school students, 467 boys and 682 girls. Regression analysis results suggest that, in addition to motivation and self-efficacy, there are several emotions which significantly shape the autonomous use of technology related to language learning. Out of these, confusion (with a negative effect) and boredom (surprisingly with a positive effect) influence autonomy for all students, while pride and shame are significant only for boys and anxiety exclusively for girls. Our results have both theoretical and pedagogical implications. The findings concerning the individual difference variables tested contribute to the study of the complex interplay of these variables, and the pedagogical implications draw our attention to the important role of teachers in shaping emotions. © The Author(s) 2024.#FRE#
