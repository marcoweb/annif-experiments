#ITI#Exploring the Perspectives and Readiness of Undergraduate Tutors Regarding Synchronous Online One-to-One Tutoring for Pupils in Rural Areas#FTI#
#IRE#This study surveyed 343 undergraduate online tutors in Taiwan to gather their perspectives regarding online tutoring and to investigate their readiness levels for online tutoring. After the tutors taught online for one semester, surveys were distributed. The data were gathered over a period extending from the 2015 fall semester to the 2020 spring semester. Approximately 90% of participants agreed that online tutoring was a good experience and that it made them feel like a useful person. Through an exploratory factor analysis, the Online-tutor Readiness Scale was validated in four dimensions: teaching strategies, technology self-efficacy, motivation for teaching, and online communication self-efficacy. The tutors’ readiness levels for online tutoring were moderately above the average levels. The findings of this study may enhance educators’ understanding of how to apply the Online-tutor Readiness Model in ways that are most beneficial for tutors who teach rural pupils#FRE#
