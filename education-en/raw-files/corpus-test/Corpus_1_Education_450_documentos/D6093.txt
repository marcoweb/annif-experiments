#ITI#Legal and political activism: the next wave of student-athlete protest#FTI#
#IRE#Historically, there have been many instances where Black student-athletes utilized activism to be change agents within athletics and the broader society. This article utilizes Harry Edward's four waves of Black athlete activism as historical context for legal and political activism as contemporary and future protest strategies among Black student-athletes. Likewise, we use racial formation theory as a theoretical context to do the same. Finally, after the historical and contemporary analyses, we offer a discussion and conclusion for legal and political activism as enduring racial projects for Black student-athletes#FRE#
