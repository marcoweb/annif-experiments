#ITI#Perceived Social Support, Psychological Capital, and Subjective Well-Being among College Students in the Context of Online Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic#FTI#
#IRE#This study examined the relationship between perceived social support and subjective well-being among college students in the context of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. 515 college students in China that participated in an online questionnaire investigation were selected as the research sample. The results showed that perceived social support was significantly and positively associated with life satisfaction and positive affect and was significantly and negatively related to negative affect among college students learning online during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological capital (PsyCap) significantly mediated the relationships between perceived social support and three subjective well-being variables. The present study provides some implications to protect college students’ subjective well-being in the context of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic#FRE#
