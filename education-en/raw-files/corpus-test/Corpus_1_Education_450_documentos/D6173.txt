#ITI#Under/misrepresentation of Ghanaian Languages in the Literature Curriculum in Senior High Schools#FTI#
#IRE#In this paper, I examined how discourses about English and European/Western ways of speaking, doing, and being have been taken up in the literature curriculum and the books students are required to read. I conducted a critical content analysis of both the literature curriculum in addition to required books for students. I found that Ghanaian languages and cultures in the required books are either under-represented or inauthentically represented, even in books written by Ghanaian authors. Because students are also mainly assessed on their ability to recognize literary devices in the books they read, the curriculum fails to encourage students to critically engage with the content they read. In this paper, I argue that because Ghanaian students do not see themselves, their languages, and their own cultures in assigned books, the curriculum—rather than disrupt—reinforces an English language hegemony to the disadvantage of Ghanaian ways of speaking, doing, and being#FRE#
