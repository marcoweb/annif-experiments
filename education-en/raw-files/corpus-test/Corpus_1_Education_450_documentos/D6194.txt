#ITI#A Coat of Many Colours: A Critical Race Theory Analysis of Language Uses at Two South African Higher Education Institutions#FTI#
#IRE#Many African higher education entrants have an African language as a first language, whereas English and Afrikaans are default media of instruction in South African higher education institutions (HEIs). This precludes equivalent chances of academic success for students. Linguistic diversity in HEIs might also influence students’ experiences in these institutions. This paper explores the perspectives of undergraduate students at a historically Black higher education institution (HBHEI) and a historically White higher education institution (HWHEI), regarding language use at these institutions and their accompanying experiences. We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with 31 students and analysed the data using thematic analysis. We adopted a critical race theory lens to interpret participants’ perspectives. We found enduring marginalisation of African languages, as informed by structural dynamics, and its detrimental effects on students’ academic prospects and experiences, contrasting with the enduring privileging of English and Afrikaans in higher education#FRE#
