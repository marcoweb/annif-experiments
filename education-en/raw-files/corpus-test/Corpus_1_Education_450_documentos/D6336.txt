#ITI#Categorisations of care: Exploring representations of care leavers in higher education through critical praxis#FTI#
#IRE#In this paper, we explore the critical praxis approach of an equity initiative with students who have left care. We contend that ‘praxis’ (International Studies in Widening Participation, 2018, 5: 10–20) – understood here as the close, dialogic and iterative relationship between research and practice, can be a powerful tool for approaching ordinarily rigid equity categorisations as a means for interrogating their conceptual efficacy while simultaneously creating more exploratory approaches to equity populations and initiatives. We examine how unproblematised notions of care leavers migrate between fields and institutions, arguing for a more robust and rigorous interrogation of the salience of the concept of a care leaver as it is integrated into the field of higher education. We contend that rigid definitions of care that narrowly define people only through their relationship to formalised state-legitimated forms of welfare intervention risk making ‘absent’ (Epistemologies of the south: Justice against Epistemicide, 2014; Routledge) the substantial population of people nearby this experience of care. This includes people who have escaped official definitions as policies change, circumstances that are similar or identical to people placed in care that have not been included in the official definition of care, or the overlapping and intersecting conditions of marginality that often shape the conditions for being removed into state care. Critical praxis is offered here as providing the basis for allowing the category of ‘care leaver’ or ‘care experienced’ to become an in-road for expanding practice initiatives and research understandings to further dimensions of marginalisation and social vulnerability#FRE#
