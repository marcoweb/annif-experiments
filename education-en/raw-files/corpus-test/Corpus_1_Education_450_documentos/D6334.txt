#ITI#The impact of distributed leadership on teacher commitment: The mediation role of teacher workload stress and teacher well-being#FTI#
#IRE#This research aims to investigate the relationship between distributed leadership in a school and teacher commitment, emphasising the mediating roles of teachers' workload stress and teacher well-being using the Teaching and Learning International Survey dataset 2018 with 47 regions. Structural equation modelling on pooled and separate country samples was used to analyse the data. Results indicate that the impact of distributed leadership on teacher commitment is mediated by workload stress and well-being across all jurisdictions, with a few exceptions. The study also suggests that distributed leadership is necessary to support teacher well-being via the lens of their workload, which may lead to an increase in teacher sense of commitment. The results recommend practitioners and policymakers support and sustain the distribution of decision-making powers among the school community and establish a culture of collaboration and mutual responsibility for the operation of the school. In this way, a less stressful work environment and consequently increased teacher mental and physical well-being and commitment might be possible#FRE#
