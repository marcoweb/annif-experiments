#IRE#In this paper, we consider the challenges for Physical Education Teacher Education (PETE) that were presented during the COVID-19 pandemic in regard to preservice teachers’ knowledge in and about movement and their developing movement capability. Historically, learning about movement as well as learning in movement has always been central for physical education and PETE. The question this paper addresses is how the teaching and learning of movement capability are experienced by PETE educators and preservice teachers when taught online. We specifically ask what are the gains and losses when movement knowledge is taught online in PETE compared to when taught in face-to-face teaching? Movement knowledge in this study is firstly inspired by Arnold’s (1991. The preeminence of skill as an educational value in the movement curriculum. Quest, 43(1), 66–77) conceptualisation of knowing in and about movement. Our conception of the meaning of knowing in movement is also informed by the concept of movement capability as outlined by recent research. We argue that movement capability offers some additional unique perspectives to our research question. Educators and preservice teachers at two PETE institutions in Sweden were interviewed in order to investigate their experiences of teaching and participating respectively in movement courses as full online education due to restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The informants were asked questions about their experiences of having participated in movement courses face-to-face as well as online. The combination of Arnold’s framework (knowledge in and about movement) with movement capability in this study increases the understanding of the meaning of movement knowledge for future physical education teachers. The results show that possibilities to develop movement capability at the one hand seem to be reduced with regard to opportunities to interact face-to-face with other people whilst at the other hand, possibilities to develop movement capability seem to be increased when learners can practise specific ways of moving without an audience#FRE#
