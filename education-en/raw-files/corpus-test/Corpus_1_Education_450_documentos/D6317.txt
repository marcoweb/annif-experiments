#ITI#Mental wellbeing among higher education students in England during the pandemic: A longitudinal study of COVID-19 experiences, social connectedness and greenspace use#FTI#
#IRE#The COVID-19 pandemic control measures substantially impacted the life of university students in the UK. While multiple studies investigated early stages of the pandemic, focusing on risk factors for depression and anxiety, fewer studies assessed later phases of the pandemic or examined positive protective factors for mental wellbeing. Our longitudinal study investigated changes and associations between COVID-19 experiences, lifestyle behaviours, social connectedness and mental wellbeing in the second year of the pandemic. The validated Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale was used to measure the primary outcome mental wellbeing. Self-reported data from 161 university students (18–35-year-old) in England was obtained. Data collection took place across two time points with contrasting COVID-19 epidemiological and countermeasure attributes. T1 occurred in the spring of 2021, during the tail end of the third national lockdown when indoor household mixing was prohibited and vaccination rates were low among 18–35 year olds. T2 took place 6 months later, in the autumn of 2021, when restrictions had ended and vaccination rates were high. Within-participant changes in students showed that mental wellbeing significantly improved over 6 months, suggesting positive adjustment. Fear of COVID-19 and engagement in COVID-19 protective behaviours significantly decreased as pandemic restrictions eased. Physical activity levels were high and did not change over time, while greenspace visits significantly diminished. Social support remained the same and group membership significantly increased over time. Hierarchal regressions revealed that social support was the most critical contributor to mental wellbeing. We discuss lessons for mental wellbeing promotion strategies: encouraging the use of greenspace as locations for distanced social interaction and physical activity in times of lockdown constraints#FRE#
