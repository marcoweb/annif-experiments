#IRE#This study aims to investigate the role of harmonious classroom environment to promote student’s sense of belonging and engagement in online learning. Harmonious classroom environment is addressed with student–teacher relationship and student–student relationship, while student engagement comprises three interrelated components of cognitive, affective and behavioral engagement. In this paper, respondents are recruited from Tencent classroom. Three hundred and five valid data are obtained to analyze by structural equation model. The results reveal that harmonious relationships positively predict student’s sense of belonging and engagement in online learning. Furthermore, sense of belonging is a mediator between harmonious relationships and student engagement. Accordingly, it seems important for online learning platform to establish positive student–teacher relationship and student–student relationship for motivating students to engage in learning activities#FRE#
