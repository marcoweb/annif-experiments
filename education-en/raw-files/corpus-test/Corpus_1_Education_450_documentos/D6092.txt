#ITI#The development of craft in Australian National Rugby League referees#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study was to explore the manner in which Australian National Rugby League (NRL) referees developed their craft. Craftmanship represents an enduring, basic human impulse, related to the desire to do a job well for its own sake (Sennett, R. (2008). Prologue: Man as his own maker. In R. Sennett (Ed.), The craftsman (pp. 1–15). Yale University Press). Specifically, in this study craftsmanship related to the specialist trade knowledge, work ethics and attributes, motor skills, cognitive processes, pre-match routines, workplace affordances, attention to detail, and dispositional qualities contributing to elite rugby league refereeing performance. Data generation included semi-structured interviews with current NRL referees (n = 8), NRL referee coaches (n = 2), NRL referee advisor/administrator (n = 1), and an immediately retired NRL referee (n = 1); game observations; direct involvement from the lead author in work meetings and game review processes, as well as casual workplace conversations over the immersion period. In addition, each participant completed a survey related to ranking sources of learning they believed contributed to the development of their craft. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically along with the field notes generated through game observations and the immersion period. Findings highlighted how referees used combinations of specialist trade knowledge such as game management, game understanding, context, trusted peer support, and knowledge of rules, in conjunction with their own experiences and desire to learn, to shape and develop their work. Overall, this reinforces the idea that workplace affordances, an individual’s personal agency, and the interrelationships between them, are crucial components for understanding how referees develop their craft. Findings from this research might be generative for sport referees and those responsible for the recruitment, professional learning, and development of these key sport actors#FRE#
