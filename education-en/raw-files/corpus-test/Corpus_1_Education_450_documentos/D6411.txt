#ITI#Influence of Teacher-and-Peer Support on Positive Academic Emotions in EFL Learning: The Mediating Role of Mindfulness#FTI#
#IRE#With the advent of positive psychology, the role of positive emotions has received more attention. This study explores the relationship among teacher-and-peer support, mindfulness, and positive academic emotions in EFL learning among non-English majors in China. The results reveal that teacher-and-peer support and mindfulness positively predict positive academic emotions. Besides, mindfulness plays a mediating role between teacher-and-peer support and positive academic emotions. Based on the findings, this paper suggests that teachers could try to enhance teacher-and-peer support and improve students’ mindfulness so as to help learners regulate their emotions as well as achieve better academic performance in English learning#FRE#
