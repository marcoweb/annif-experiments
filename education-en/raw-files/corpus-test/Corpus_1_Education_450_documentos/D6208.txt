#ITI#Queer feminist interruptions to internationalising UK higher education#FTI#
#IRE#This paper considers queer feminist interruptions as a way to halt, reverse and rethink internationalisation in UK higher education (HE). These points of intervention are situated within the queer development studies literature, which provides a framework for understanding internationalisation practices alongside other strategies of Western extraction, critical of claims that internationalisation is important for enhancing diversity. Throughout, the paper confronts the problematic, colonial narratives of global LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) human rights progress as framed by the global north, and how UK internationalisation strategy often reproduces or doubles-down on these narratives. The central questions addressed are: (1) how does queer liberation help academics think differently about promoting, participating in and developing UK HE internationally? (2) What can academics learn from those working to centre queer feminist practices in their transnational research and teaching? In conversation with critical internationalisation studies scholarship, this paper contributes to ongoing research about internalisation with a queer sensitivity. As such, the paper highlights the limiting binary logics and heteronormativity in internationalisation, as well as new directions for collaboration across communities working for radical liberation on campus beyond agendas of inclusion#FRE#
