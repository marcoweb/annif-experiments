#ITI#Experiences and motivations of dancers with and without disabilities in inclusive dance#FTI#
#IRE#Research has indicated that understanding experiences, motivations and the social environments of dancers without disabilities is essential for developing effective dance training [Quested, E., & Duda, J. L. (2010). Exploring the social-environmental determinants of well-and ill-being in dancers: A test of basic needs theory. Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology, 32(1), 39–60]. However, research examining these elements in professional inclusive dance settings has been limited. The purposes of this qualitative study were to explore: (1) experiences and motivations of dancers with and without disabilities in an inclusive professional dance company and (2) important program features related to inclusive dance performances. Interviews were completed with dancers with (N = 3) and without (N = 7) disabilities performing with an inclusive dance company. As an inductive qualitative study, thematic analysis was utilized to analyze and clarify data. Three themes developed: fascination with inclusive dance, supportive environment and differences in perspectives. Findings support: (a) use of self-determination theory (SDT) to gain an understanding of the experiences and social environments in inclusive settings and (b) importance of the development of a supportive environment in inclusive dance. Implications for inclusive dance programs include recognition of the motivating power of viewing performances and dancing with professional inclusive dance companies, and recognition of differences of perceptions of dancers with and without disabilities in inclusive dance settings with emphasis on perspectives of dancers with disabilities#FRE#
