#ITI#Seizing the opportunity to redesign physical education teacher education: blending paradigms to create transformative experiences in teacher education#FTI#
#IRE#The COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged many to engage with determining what is most effective in the realm of teaching and learning and how we can negotiate what we have done in the past with what makes sense for the future. In proposing a framework in which to encourage the community of physical education teacher educators to redefine physical education teacher education (PETE) practices, we argue that we need to start by revisiting, embedding and challenging Zeichner’s [(1983). Alternative paradigms of teacher education. Journal of Teacher Education, 34(3), 3–9] paradigms at a programmatic level. Drawing on Rink’s [(1993). Teacher education: A focus on action. Quest (Grand Rapids, Mich), 45(3), 308–320] main thesis of considering the different philosophical orientations as complementary, and not competing ideologies, this paper is a response to the call of Carmi and Tamir [(2020). Three professional ideals: Where should teacher preparation go next? European Journal of Teacher Education] to improve strategies for blending paradigms in teacher preparation programmes, by providing some specific directions and reflective prompts for PETE programmes. We introduce the reader to the consideration that decisions made around the paradigms and the blending of paradigms across a programme may be essential to provide pre-service teachers (PSTs) with transformative experiences that enable their understanding of the different contexts and ontologies to succeed in their pedagogical and professional endeavours. We develop a double-pyramid approach evidencing how more than one paradigm of teacher education can co-exist to create a holistic and comprehensive plan to facilitate PETE. We convey that a programmatic structure with decisions around the paradigms and their blending, and how those might shape PSTs’ educational experience will provide a starting point if teacher educators are to re-define PETE practices#FRE#
