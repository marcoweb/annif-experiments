#ITI#Dual careers and academic achievements: does elite sport make a difference?#FTI#
#IRE#In the literature on Dual Careers (DC) there has been an ongoing debate on whether there is a trade-off between being an elite athlete and achieving academically. Is the time needed to compete at the highest level a barrier to academic achievement? Or can knowledge and expertise obtained from an elite sporting career be transferred into academic performance? In this paper, we aim to answer these questions using a unique database on talented young athletes enrolled in the Danish high-performance program covering the period from 2010 to 2019. Comparing high school graduation grades from a full national sample of non-athlete high school students and elite athletes who also attend high school–and controlling for relevant covariates–our results suggest that student-athletes perform better than their fellow students who are not engaged in elite sport. We also test whether DC support initiatives make a difference in this regard. Results and implications of the study are discussed#FRE#
