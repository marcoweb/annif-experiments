#ITI#Examining the Influence of Teaching Presence and Task-Technology Fit on Continuance Intention to Use MOOCs#FTI#
#IRE#This study aimed to examine the structural relationships among factors that affect learners’ continuance intention to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Drawing upon the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), it posited teaching presence and task-technology fit as exogenous variables, examining how they affect continuance intention to use MOOCs, mediated by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Based on survey data from 252 Korean MOOC learners, structural equation modeling was employed to assess the model. The results indicated that perceived usefulness affected continuance intention to use, while perceived ease of use did not; however, perceived ease of use did affect perceived usefulness. Further, teaching presence was not significantly related to continuance intention to use or perceived usefulness, but did affect perceived ease of use. However, task-technology fit affected perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and continuance intention to use. Finally, the mediating role of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use on the relationships between teaching presence as well as task-technology fit and continuance intention were confirmed. Implications were suggested for designing courses in MOOCs to increase continuance intention to use#FRE#
