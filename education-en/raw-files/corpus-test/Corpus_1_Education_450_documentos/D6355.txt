#ITI#Impact of Humorous Chinese-Teaching Videos and Echo Method on Teaching Chinese Language: A Case Study of Vietnamese Students#FTI#
#IRE#This study investigates the efficiency of humorous teaching videos integrated with the echo method in comparison with traditional teaching methods using humorous teaching handouts. There are 59 participants in this study divided into 2 groups of a quasi-experimental design. The findings indicate that the new teaching method design with humorous videos and echo method help learners gain higher learning outcomes, effectiveness of memorizing vocabulary and self-efficacy for learning & performance motivation. Educators are suggested to integrate humorous videos and the echo method in teaching Chinese. Future research should provide a selection standard of humorous videos in teaching Chinese. The impact of humorous videos on 6 dimensions of learning motivation in MSLQ should be further investigated#FRE#
