#ITI#Do L2 Teacher Support and Peer Support Predict L2 Speaking Motivation in Online Classes?#FTI#
#IRE#The present study explored how second or foreign language (L2) teachers and peers’ academic and personal support can shape English as a foreign language (EFL) learners’ L2 speaking motivation in the context of online education. In doing so, a total of 236 (96 males and 140 females) EFL university students voluntarily filled in a set of questionnaires. The findings from a Linear Regression analysis conducted in structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that both L2 teacher support and peer support significantly impact the speaking motivation of EFL learners, with L2 teacher support exerting a slightly stronger influence compared to peer support. Moreover, the personal support provided by both L2 teachers and peers was found to be more influential in predicting L2 speaking motivation than their academic support. The study discusses the implications and provides further insights into these results. © De La Salle University 2023.#FRE#
