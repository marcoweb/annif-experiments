#ITI#Using English as an International Language for Fluency Development in the Internationalised Asian University Context#FTI#
#IRE#The present study exemplifies the potential of International Corner Speed Chatting activities to enhance English fluency when local students use English as an international language (EIL) with other local as well as international students. For data collection during the activity, classroom observation through video recording and photography was employed; a closed and open-ended questionnaire were administered after the activity. The data analysis results show that this set of activities, incorporating mini presentation, speed chatting, reflection reporting, and group discussion, helped students develop EIL fluency. The fluency activities provided the instructor the opportunity of taking on the roles of planner and guide whilst encouraging learner autonomy. EIL fluency was achieved through maximal repeated effective integrated-skills English speaking and listening across multiple contexts with interlocutors possessing varied linguistic and cultural backgrounds#FRE#
