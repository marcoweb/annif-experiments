#ITI#Visualizing the Commognitive Processes of Collaborative Problem Solving in Mathematics Classrooms#FTI#
#IRE#The ability of solving problems collaboratively has been increasingly significant. This research takes mathematics open-ended problems as the tasks and carries out collaborative problem solving with multi-machine video recording in the classroom environment aimed at 112 student pairs and 56 four-person student groups stemming from 224 students in the seventh grade. Based on the theory of commognition, this research develops an analytical framework for the performance of commognition in students’ collaborative problem solving and provides several criteria for the marginalization of commognition. Through visual analysis and representation, the results show that the capacity of group meta-level commognition is lower than that of pairs, the male has better commognitive performance than the female, and group marginalization is more serious than that of pairs#FRE#
