#ITI#From inclusion to queer-trans pedagogy in school and physical education: a narrative ethnography of trans generosity#FTI#
#IRE#Originally suggested by Rodriguez (2012), trans generosity aims to address the tensions and complexities of queer and trans pedagogies in educational settings. Using this concept, this study generates empirical insights on how queer and trans affirmative practices can disrupt heteronormativity, foster gender diversity and proactively emphasize the self-determination of trans students in schools and PE. Drawing on narrative ethnography, we relate the experiences of Lucas, a secondary trans student, during a period of four years, using the messy method of data collection. A dialogical narrative analysis helped to give sense to the whats, the hows, and the effects of Lucas’s stories and storytelling within the narrative environment of the school. Legal and educational policy and academic frameworks provided Lucas and other actors with an adequate space for critical performances to foster the disruption of heteronormativity and broaden the circulation of (queer)gender narratives within the school. The dialogue, commitment, collaboration, and mutual trust between Lucas, his PE teacher and the school environment helped to make Lucas’ trans affirmative stories tellable and coherent. This story of trans generosity may inspire other trans students, PE teachers, schools, or whoever wants to embrace queer and trans theories and pedagogies, to foster trans recognition and gender diversity education#FRE#
