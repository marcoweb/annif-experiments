#ITI#The Social Nature of Second Language Metacognition#FTI#
#IRE#Metacognition is one of the key notions in contemporary research both in second language (L2) teaching and education in general. L2 metacognition has been found to contribute significantly to learner variables such as language learning motivation. The main feature of the findings on L2 metacognition research based on the diverse theoretical disciplines is its individualistic and cognitive nature. Metacognition does not come from a vacuum, and social experiences provide core ingredients for its development and maintenance. This paper aims to explore the roles of metacognition in the interpersonal and societal spheres from an Hegelian perspective. The results of this paper suggest that metacognition involves emotion, and the social aspect plays important roles in the formation and maintenance of metacognition. Hegelian philosophy suggests that metacognition exerts positive influences on the L2 learning of individual learners, as well as performs social and moral functions on a collective level. The major pedagogical recommendation is that in enhancing the metacognition of language learners, teachers should focus on the emotional, interpersonal, and social aspects. Teachers should also raise learners’ awareness of their roles in the larger society#FRE#
