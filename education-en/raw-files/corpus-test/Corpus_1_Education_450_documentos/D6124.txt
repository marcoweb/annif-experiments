#ITI#The Heritage Language Learner in Study Abroad Programs: Challenges to Achieving Intercultural Competence#FTI#
#IRE#This article investigates the intercultural competence and identities of undergraduate heritage language learners (HLLs) studying abroad under the auspices of the U.S. Flagship Program. Based on survey responses and interviews with HLLs from Flagship Programs across the country, the article aims to assess the preparation of HLLs for study abroad and provides recommendations on the advisability of adopting an IC Level 3 standard that HLLs must meet prior to departure. We argue HLLs in study abroad programs require a specialized approach to achieve intercultural competence, with attention to cultural differentiation, development of an intercultural identity, and appreciation of the culturally-specific nature of language use#FRE#
