#ITI#The structural and micropolitical realities of physical literacy professional development in the United Kingdom: navigating professional vulnerability#FTI#
#IRE#This research examines the implications of professional vulnerability (PV) during physical literacy (PL) teacher professional development, through the lens of structural and micropolitical theory in the United Kingdom (U.K.). The research was conducted over a twelve-week period with qualified teachers across primary and secondary school contexts, within the U.K. Semi-structured interviews were used to capture the professional development journey of each teacher. Thematic analysis and pen profiles were used to analyse and present the findings of the semi-structured interviews. The results explore expressions of teacher vulnerability through the structural and micropolitical realities experienced during PL professional development. Structural realities were categorised using the political (macro), organisational (meso) and structural (micro) levels with the micropolitical realities categorised using the power dynamics of power over, with and through. This paper calls for the contextual element of professional development to be given as much consideration as the content itself. Professional development can be more effective by connecting the ‘what’ and ‘how’ alongside an understanding of the ‘where’ and ‘who’. Structural and micropolitical theory and PV offer glimpses into this contextual world, revealing a different but equally important narrative around the wider context of successful and meaningful PL teacher professional development. Finally, the study identifies aspects of transferability into the wider domains of sport coaching and sport development where PL is becoming increasingly visible#FRE#
