#ITI#Professional satisfaction of physical education teachers#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this paper was to explore the job satisfaction of physical education teachers. A descriptive-interpretative methodology was applied to data from a questionnaire aimed at primary and secondary school physical education teachers who work in public, state-funded and private schools in Spain. The contributions of self-determination theory as a framework for studying teacher job satisfaction have been the foundation for substantiating and interpreting the research findings. In this sense, we have taken into account the basic psychological needs and motivations of teachers as triggers for their professional satisfaction. In line with most of the research reviewed, feelings of competence for the job, decision-making autonomy as well as relational and psychological aspects seem to play a determinant role in the development of professional satisfaction. As a recommendation, we note that teacher satisfaction improves when there is full support by education administrators, high performance standards, appreciation for teaching work and collegiality among peers#FRE#
