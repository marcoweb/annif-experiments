#ITI#Online Learning Self-Efficacy in Using Technology among Turkish and Kazakh EFL Teachers#FTI#
#IRE#Self-efficacy has contributed to foreign language education contexts profoundly. However, with recent changes, especially after the pandemic, more is needed to learn about language teachers' self-efficacy in using technology in online education. To address this issue, the current study tried to reveal online learning self-efficacy in using technology among EFL teachers from a cross-cultural perspective involving Turkish and Kazakh teachers. The study followed a qualitative inquiry, and an open-ended questionnaire was employed. The study involved 43 EFL teachers, 21 from Türkiye and 22 from Kazakhstan. The data obtained from the open-ended questions were analysed with the help of MAXQDA software. Top-down and bottom-up strategies were utilised concurrently to form the themes and subthemes. The results indicated that Turkish and Kazakh EFL teachers shared nearly similar views regarding feelings, challenges, factors, and strategies on online learning self-efficacy in using technology in EFL courses, while they held different views regarding the influence of culture on online learning self-efficacy in using technology in EFL courses. The study concluded with a discussion of the findings to provide implications for foreign language educators. © De La Salle University 2023.#FRE#
