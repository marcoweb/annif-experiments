#ITI#I and Thou? Challenges to dialogical pedagogy in a diverse London secondary school#FTI#
#IRE#A growing body of literature suggests that ‘intercultural education’ is an important tool for transformative learning about oneself and the other. Yet little is known about the challenges and opportunities of intercultural education in practice, particularly in light of an increasing focus in Western education policy on testing and standardisation. This article uses ethnographic and focus group research in an ethnically diverse secondary school in East London to empirically explore the opportunities and challenges of intercultural education in practice. It highlights similarities between the concept of intercultural education and Martin Buber's theory of the ‘I−Thou’ encounter, suggesting that this dialogical relation has the potential to transform stereotypes and develop personhood. The research findings show how teachers at the East London secondary school employed dialogical techniques to encourage critical perspectives among their students and to cultivate their trust, a key element of I−Thou encounter. The findings also, however, draw attention to the deleterious impact of the marketised education paradigm on the dialogical relation, demonstrating how a policy focus on attainment and the narrow national curriculum limit opportunities for dialogue in the classroom and erode trust between teacher and student. The article argues that there is a clear and urgent imperative for change within the Western education system if Buber's dialogical pedagogy is to bear fruit and transformative learning is to take place#FRE#
