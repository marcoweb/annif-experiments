#ITI#The Development of Curriculum Leadership in Teachers: A Multiple Case Study#FTI#
#IRE#Teacher curriculum leadership is a key driver of curriculum reform in basic education and of improvements in student literacy. The mechanisms that underlie its development therefore constitute an important area of study. This case study analyzed the developmental trajectory of three teachers who became curriculum leaders. Results showed that from the static “macro” perspective, teacher curriculum leadership was generated by developing a sense of autonomous leadership, practicing culture leadership, and achieving an implicit leadership identity. From the dynamic “micro” perspective, teacher curriculum leadership comprised a permeable process of development from lower to higher levels. The study recommends creating an environment that nurtures teacher curriculum leadership by supporting professional competence and collaboration. © De La Salle University 2023.#FRE#
