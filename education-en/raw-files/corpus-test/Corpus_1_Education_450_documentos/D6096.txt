#ITI#Lesson study in physical education: a collaborative and contextualised approach to initial teacher training#FTI#
#IRE#Lesson study is a collaborative and contextualised approach to professional learning that involves small groups of teachers working together to design and reflect on the teaching of a research lesson. Although it is a well-established approach to professional learning in classroom-based subjects, research on its effectiveness within physical education (PE) initial teacher training (ITT) and in the general practice of PE teachers is scarce. This study examines the views of 18 secondary PE associate teachers (ATs) who completed a lesson study cycle as part of their one-year postgraduate ITT programme. A questionnaire and semi-structured interviews–conducted at the end of the lesson study and six months later at the end of the programme–were used to generate data. Thematic analysis was then used to interrogate the data and identify patterns of response. The findings revealed that the ATs benefitted from the experience in similar ways to established teachers. They developed their understanding of lesson research and engaged in elevated levels of critical reflection that helped to change and develop their approaches to teaching and learning. Moreover, the ATs recognised that their learning was enhanced when they could rehearse the phases of the cycle before starting the lesson study in their placement school. They also understood the value of a mentor who could support their progress and ensure their full engagement in all phases of the lesson study cycle. These findings have implications for providers of ITT as the considered inclusion of lesson study contributed to the immediate aim of developing ATs’ teaching competencies while also promoting the skills needed for them to manage their own ongoing learning as fully qualified teachers#FRE#
