#ITI#A qualitative systematic review of critical pedagogy in Physical Education and Sport for Development: exploring a dialogical and critical future for Sport for Development pedagogy#FTI#
#IRE#This is the first systematic qualitative review to examine and organise the current body of research that addresses the practical application of critical pedagogy within Physical Education and Sport for Development. Following a rigorous systematic review process, this paper analyses critical pedagogy, social justice and social transformation through Freire’s [(1972). Pedagogy of the oppressed. Penguin] concept of dialogical and anti-dialogical action. The themes generated through the analysis of Physical Education were (1) the challenge of teaching social justice through dialogue and negotiation in Physical Education, (2) the challenge of using critical pedagogy to inform about social justice in Physical Education Teacher Education and (3) the challenge of applying critical pedagogy in Physical Education Teacher Education. The themes that were generated through the analysis for Sport for Development were (1) challenging dominant approaches towards pedagogy in Sport for Development and (2) the challenge of designing professional development in Sport for Development. The internationally relevant results explore the challenges faced in the implementation of critical pedagogy in both Physical Education and Sport for Development and critically analyse the capacity for future applications of critical pedagogy within Sport for Development. Findings suggest that social transformation in Sport for Development is more likely to be realised through a critical shift in curriculum and professional development that embraces dialogue, reflection, negotiation and collaboration. Further to this, developing pedagogy within a culture of social justice will enable Sport for Development organisations to further challenge their own values, attitudes and beliefs whilst critically exploring the wider social implications of their practice#FRE#
