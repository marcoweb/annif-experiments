#ITI#Promoting Sociopolitical Consciousness and Bicultural Goals of Dual Language Education: The Transformational Dual Language Educational Framework#FTI#
#IRE#This study examined Spanish-English dual language (DL) K-6 teachers in collaborative professional development as they worked towards achieving the bicultural goal of DL education, beyond traditional interpretations, and incorporating sociopolitical consciousness as a fourth goal. These two principles are part of the transformational DL educational framework. Classroom observations and teachers’ documents relevant to these objectives were recorded and analyzed, and teaching practices were categorized according to James A. Banks’ classic model of levels of integration of multicultural content. Findings show teachers’ trajectories varied throughout the school year. This article shows examples of multicultural teaching practices in three lessons, highlighting elements classified as contributions, additive, transformative, and social action, acknowledging hybrid forms. Results show that, when the principles of biculturalism and sociopolitical consciousness are intentional, educators can begin meeting these goals for equitable DL education#FRE#
