#ITI#Pre-service Teacher Education Reforms: An Attempt to Make Pakistan a Tolerant Society#FTI#
#IRE#We argue that the past-political discourses reshaped the way people conceptualized nature and sources of knowledge (Epistemic Beliefs), and thereby developed intolerant social attitudes in Pakistan. Efforts were made to change this situation through pre-service teacher education reforms by focussing on developing epistemic beliefs and social attitudes of prospective teachers. By collecting data from prospective teachers and teacher educators, we attempted to examine their epistemic development and attitudes towards women’s education and employability, other religions, and ethnicities. We found that prospective teachers’ social attitudes are highly influenced by their epistemic beliefs, whereas, their epistemic development is highly influenced by teacher educators. © De La Salle University 2023.#FRE#
