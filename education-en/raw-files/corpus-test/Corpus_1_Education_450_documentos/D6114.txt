#ITI#Language Attitudes and Ethnic Identity: Examining Listener Perceptions of Latvian-Russian Bilingual Speakers#FTI#
#IRE#This study explored the attitudes of ethnic Latvian listeners towards Latvian–Russian bilinguals. Fifty-seven ethnic Latvians completed an identity questionnaire to obtain estimates of their ethnic beliefs and rated the speech of eight Latvian–Russian bilinguals for personal traits, judged how well social and ethnic labels apply to bilinguals, and expressed behavioral choices based on their experience with bilinguals’ speech. Listeners generally categorized speakers in linguistic terms, rather than by ethnicity, downgrading only ethnic Russians speaking low-level Latvian in ratings of honesty (solidarity) and education (status), but upgrading the same speakers in terms of listener preference for these speakers as potential entrepreneurs. Listeners’ own identity beliefs were moderately associated with their ratings, but only for the evaluations of ethnic Russians speaking Russian. These findings provide insights into Latvian–Russian bilingualism, implicating several processes underlying language attitudes, stemming from the current ethnolinguistic context of Latvia and also potentially from listeners’ difficulty processing low-proficiency speakers#FRE#
