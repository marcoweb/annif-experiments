#ITI#Learning and Academic Self-efficacy in Self-regulated Learning: Validation Study with the BOPPPS Model and IRS Methods#FTI#
#IRE#This study aims to explore college students’ learning and academic self-efficacy in self-regulated learning and the effectiveness of learner-centered education by integrating the bridge-in, objective, pre-assessment, participatory learning, post-assessment, and summary (BOPPPS) model and interactive response system (IRS) tool. Accordingly, learning self-efficacy includes five dimensions, namely, conceptual understanding, everyday application, practical work, higher-order cognitive skills, and science communication. Meanwhile, self-regulated learning represents six dimensions, namely, goal setting, environment structuring, task strategies, time management, help seeking, and self-evaluation. Questionnaire responses were collected from hospitality students in the university for the subject of hospitality cost control. Results showed that learners’ learning self-efficacy was positively associated with academic self-efficacy, while self-regulated learning mediated the relations between learners’ learning and academic self-efficacy. Moreover, results indicated that students who participate in class demonstrate substantially high learning and academic self-efficacy for integrating the BOPPPS model and IRS methods in their classroom, particularly in the post-test rather than in the pre-test. Lastly, results provide empirical evidence for learning and academic achievement of self-efficacy, self-regulated learning, and effective teaching design in the tourism and hospitality setting context#FRE#
