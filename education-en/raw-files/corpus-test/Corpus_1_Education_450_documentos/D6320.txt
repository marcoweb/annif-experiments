#ITI#Theorising the potential of physical education and school sport to support the educational engagement, transitions and outcomes of care-experienced young people#FTI#
#IRE#Much research highlights the potential of physical education and school sport (PESS) to provide personal, social and educational benefits for young people. As such, it is suggested that PESS contexts could be particularly relevant to pupils who might be considered marginalised or ‘at risk’—including care-experienced young people—affording opportunities to gain skills, connections and experiences to aid a positive educational trajectory. This paper presents findings from an empirical project that explored the role of sport/physical activity within the day-to-day lives of care-experienced young people in England. A participatory methodology, underpinned by a youth voice perspective, was employed to generate data via semi-structured, activity-based focus groups with care-experienced young people (aged 8–21 years) and via narrative interviews with care leavers (aged 23–32 years). Data were analysed using inductive and deductive procedures in a process also informed by the work of Bourdieu. Drawing on data related specifically to PESS contexts, this paper looks to theorise the potential of PESS to support the educational engagement, transitions and outcomes of care-experienced young people. It demonstrates how this context can support the acquisition of physical, social and cultural capital, which can both facilitate engagement and support personal outcomes. In addition, it documents how social support provided within/through PESS can be promotive of positive transitions into further and higher education contexts. As such, it can be recognised as a valuable site within the educational landscape for care-experienced young people#FRE#
