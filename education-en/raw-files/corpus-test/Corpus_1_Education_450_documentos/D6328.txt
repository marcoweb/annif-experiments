#ITI#Helicopter mobility: Changing habitus without challenging structural inequalities, experiences of an international elite education programme#FTI#
#IRE#This original study followed up ten beneficiaries of a UK charity-led programme that supported disadvantaged students in applying to elite US universities. First interviewed in 2015 during their early university days in the United States, in our 2019 follow-up all participants had graduated. Six remained in the United States and four had returned to the United Kingdom, with only one returning to their pre-university community. They reported benefitting immensely from their international opportunities and were nearly all in high-paying graduate jobs or high-profile graduate programmes. Drawing on Bourdieu's concept of the ‘cleft habitus’, which can result from rapid and substantial shifts in field, we found that this was rare. Rather, the majority had undergone a ‘wholesale escape’, replacing their originary habitus with one that was consistent with their new field. The significance of the study is that the findings allow us to propose the concept of ‘helicopter mobility’ to describe individualised approaches to social mobility, whereby those considered to have merit are removed from their communities without questioning or affecting wider structural inequalities#FRE#
