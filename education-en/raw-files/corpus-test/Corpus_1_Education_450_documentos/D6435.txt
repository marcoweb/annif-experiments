#ITI#A Meta-analysis of Effects of Automated Writing Evaluation on Anxiety, Motivation, and Second Language Writing Skills#FTI#
#IRE#With the rapid advancement of information technologies, automated writing evaluation technologies have developed so fast that they can be applied to writing assessments. However, scanty studies have pooled the effects of automated writing evaluation on writing performance. Through a PRISMA protocol-based meta-analysis, this study concludes that automated writing evaluation technologies can significantly reduce anxiety such as writing anxiety and computer anxiety compared with those without the assistance of automated writing evaluation. Automated writing evaluation can also significantly improve writing motivation and second language (L2) writing skills. Educators and designers should highlight how to combine automated writing evaluation with human rating methods and maximize the improvements in L2 writing skills. In the future, artificial intelligence may be integrated into automated writing evaluation to develop advanced automated writing evaluation to address higher-level issues in writing practice. © De La Salle University 2024.#FRE#
