#ITI#Post-secondary vocational education for youth leaving care: Examining a potential pathway to successful outcomes#FTI#
#IRE#Post-secondary educational outcomes for care-experienced youth are poor. This has been a consistent finding across studies in many countries. Most studies do not distinguish between different types of post-secondary educational pathways and outcomes, however. There has been limited attention to the potential for post-secondary vocational education (PSVE) as a viable educational path that may lead to positive employment and social outcomes. In this paper we examine PSVE for care leavers by reviewing available data, examining policy context and utilising relevant theories. We offer next steps in policy, practice and theory development#FRE#
