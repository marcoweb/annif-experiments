#ITI#An ecological perspective of student engagement through digital technology: Practical application and implications#FTI#
#IRE#Research into how student engagement can be influenced through digital technology has continued to be at the forefront of higher education debates. This is due to the technological advancements and the recent disruptions caused by the Covid-19 lockdown, which have made it imperative for universities to adopt blended and online learning. Drawing on secondary data analysis of comments posted by 283 post-graduate students on the Canvas site (a learning management system) used in a UK university, this study investigates how to influence student engagement using digital technology from an ecological perspective. The study contributes to the existing student engagement debate by providing useful planning and pedagogic considerations for influencing all dimensions of student engagement (behavioural, affective, social and cognitive). Academics may need to adopt a compassionate pedagogical stance where students can see the importance of helping their peers as a way of learning. This approach will help to build a community of online users where the discussion board is a rich source of learning materials developed by students for students#FRE#
