#ITI#The Intersectionality of Gender, Sexuality, Race, and Native-speakerness: Investigating ELT Teacher Identity through Duoethnography#FTI#
#IRE#Teacher identity has recently emerged as an important site of research, with studies focusing on various aspects of social identities. In this study, we employ a poststructuralist intersectionality framework to teacher identity using a duoethnographic approach as a research method. This involved using narratives to explore our professional background and experiences with regard to our teaching principles and classroom interactions. Through juxtaposing our personal narratives, we found that the intersection of gender, sexuality, race, and native-speaker status has had an effect on our professional identities as language teachers and our teaching practices. This study also aims to enhance the scope of the duoethnographic approach to take into account intersectionality and social inequalities and advocate for the usefulness of this emerging research method for teacher training and professional development for language teachers#FRE#
