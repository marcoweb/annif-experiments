#ITI#Do we have to rethink inclusive pedagogies for secondary schools? A critical systematic review of the international literature#FTI#
#IRE#This article builds on the findings of a critical systematic review that aimed to explore understandings and applications of inclusive pedagogies in the secondary school. Inclusive pedagogies are often conceptualised as both a set of strategies that aim to ensure access to learning for all students, and as value principles that reflect particular views on inclusion; this is why they tend to be approached in diverse ways. We were particularly interested in secondary school as the focus on particular curricular areas and subjects, additional pressures for teachers and students derived from assessment and exams, and fewer opportunities for collaboration between teachers as a result of the compartmentalisation of the curriculum can make the implementation of inclusive pedagogies more challenging than at primary level. Six databases were searched for literature published exploring inclusive pedagogies in the context of secondary school. We found that inclusive pedagogies were often filtered through the lenses of particular subjects and were associated with other approaches with similar philosophies, such as differentiation and student-centred learning; that student perceptions of inclusive pedagogies are still little explored; and that tensions associated with inclusion were only acknowledged to some extent. Based on the findings, we argue for a refined way of understanding inclusive pedagogies in the secondary school context, one that acknowledges the unique characteristics, challenges and tensions at this school level. The review findings also affirm the ‘messiness’ of the inclusion literature and raise questions as to the relevance and usefulness of systematic reviews in exploring this fragmented topic#FRE#
