#ITI#The experiences of students with disabilities in self-contained physical education#FTI#
#IRE#Educating students with disabilities with those without in integrated physical education has become commonplace. While literature has identified that the subjective experiences of students with disabilities in such integrated settings have often included bullying, isolation, and discrimination, little is known about the experiences of those in self-contained physical education. Using Stainback and Stainback’s (1996, Collaboration, support network and community construction. In S. Stainback, & W. Stainback (Eds.), Inclusion: A guide for educators (pp. 223–232). Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.) conceptualization of inclusive education as a guiding lens, this study explored the perspectives of a group of 20 students with disabilities, aged seven through 20, enrolled in heterogenous self-contained physical education across eight public schools. Data collection included individual semi-structured interviews, drawings, and researcher notes. A three-step inductive thematic analysis revealed three primary themes: (a) importance of friendship for most, (b) interests in specific sports, and (c) most enjoyed self-contained settings. Participants’ experiences were illustrated through stories and pictures of them building and maintaining friendships during their physical education classes. A further sense of success and enjoyment in playing specific sports was shared among many participants, which transcended their overall perspectives of self-contained physical education. These findings of generally positive subjective experiences are contrary to much of what has emerged from integrated physical education research, and supported notions of belonging, acceptance, and value inherent to inclusive education. Thus, it appears that, at the very least, scholars, practitioners, and administrators should reconsider the notion that self-contained physical education cannot be inclusive, much in the manner that one cannot blindly assume that integrated settings are inclusive#FRE#
