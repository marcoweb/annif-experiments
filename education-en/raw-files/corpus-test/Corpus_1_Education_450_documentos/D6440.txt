#ITI#How is Student Resilience Affected by Teacher Feedback, Teacher Support, and Achievement Goals? A Mediation Model Based on PISA 2018 Survey Data#FTI#
#IRE#Although teacher feedback and teacher support are believed as important predictors of student resilience, few studies have compared their effects on student resilience and explored how such effects are mediated by students’ achievement goals. To address this gap, this study analysed the PISA 2018 student survey data on the four variables (i.e., student resilience, teacher feedback, teacher support and achievement goals) obtained from 41,872 participants (girls = 20,527; boys = 21,345) in six academically high-performing East Asian countries/ economies. The findings showed that (i) mastery and performance-approach goals significantly and positively predicted student resilience while the impacts of performance-avoidance goals on student resilience were negative; (ii) teacher feedback exerted a significant positive influence on student resilience both directly and indirectly, and the indirect influence was mediated by students’ achievement goals; and (iii) teacher support had only an indirect significant positive effect on student resilience mediated by achievement goals. This study establishes a mediation model to associate teacher feedback and support with student resilience via students’ achievement goals. It also reveals the cultural relevance of student resilience. The findings have implications for East Asian teachers to cultivate resilient students in changing times. © De La Salle University 2023.#FRE#
