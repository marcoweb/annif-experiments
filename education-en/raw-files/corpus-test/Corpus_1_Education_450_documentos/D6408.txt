#ITI#Current Landscape of English Language Teaching Research in Southeast Asia: A Bibliometric Analysis#FTI#
#IRE#This study sought to provide a comprehensive analysis of English language teaching (ELT) research in Southeast Asia (SEA) using both quantitative and qualitative data. Specifically, this paper sought to describe the characteristics, growth, impact, trajectory, and distribution of ELT research in the SEA region, determine the research themes that emerged and how they have evolved for the past 6 years, and identify the extent of collaboration among SEA ELT scholars. This examination, covering a 6-year period, showcases the breadth and depth of research undertaken in the region. Overall, the research productivity and citations in the region have been increasing during the inclusive years, with Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia leading the list in almost all metrics. Research designs have also become more sophisticated in recent years as research contexts and topics continue to expand. Popular topics include teacher cognition and agency, teaching practices, computer-assisted language learning, and teaching macro skills. Although collaboration among SEA countries remains modest, their collaboration with western countries is relatively extensive, especially Vietnam and Singapore. Policy implications and future directions are discussed#FRE#
