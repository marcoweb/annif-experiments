#ITI#Becoming Uyghur Elites: How Uyghur Women in a Mainstream Chinese University Negotiate Their Gendered Identities#FTI#
#IRE#Multilingual learners confront challenges not only in mastering new languages but also in forming new identities. Guided by the investment model, we traced the learning of Chinese and English of two Uyghur women who attended a coastal Chinese university and investigated how they navigated the Chinese mainstream education system to university level. Findings of this ethnographic work revealed that moving from their less developed hometown to a major city, the participants expanded and enriched their repertoire of symbolic and material resources on which they could rely to effect more powerful social memberships and negotiate their educated Uyghur identities. Their Chinese and English language learning journey and the educational experiences in the host community also changed how Uyghur women perceive their future possibilities. Their struggles and agency in their journey were also highlighted#FRE#
