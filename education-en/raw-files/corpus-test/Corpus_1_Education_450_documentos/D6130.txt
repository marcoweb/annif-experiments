#ITI#The Role of Students in the Professional Identity Negotiations of a Mexican EFL Teacher#FTI#
#IRE#The process by which novice language teachers negotiate their professional identity has been described as mediated by factors such as peers’ support, mentor’s influence, and even ideologies such as the native speakers’ fallacy. However, the role that students may play in these negotiations still needs attention. The present study examines how a middle-class Mexican teacher of English discursively negotiated his professional identity in the context of his relationship with a group of wealthy students. The analysis explores the fluid nature of discursive positioning in narratives showing how the participant positioned himself as a popular teacher. The study uncovers how social class and dominant ideologies interacted in the participants’ storytelling and demonstrates how an individual may narratively represent the struggle between agency and social structures#FRE#
