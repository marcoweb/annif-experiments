#ITI#Influence of a professional development programme on the life skills teaching practices of secondary PE teachers#FTI#
#IRE#This study examines the influences of a one-year life skills-oriented continuing professional development (CPD) programme on PE teachers’ teaching practice. Based on Ball’s (2009) generative change model, the programme was designed to facilitate pedagogical connections between programme knowledge and teachers’ practices. Eight participants (4 males, 4 females) with 2–15 years teaching experience (M = 6.25, SD = 6.23) were selected. Data were collected from interviews with teacher participants, observation and texts retrieved from online chatroom messages exchanged from January 2018 to January 2019. Data were analysed using the case study approach and cross-case analysis for pattern recognition. The study findings show how the CPD programme influences teaching practice through four patterns: (a) generative improvement, (b) delayed improvement, (c) fluctuated practice and (d) stagnant practice. The findings also highlight how the process of change through CPD participation is challenging because the learning trajectories of teachers are mediated by the complex interplay between individual, programme and school contexts. Moreover, the importance of antecedents, such as prior beliefs and participant motivation, on CPD impacts, as well as the learning design characteristics for effective CPD programmes, are addressed#FRE#
