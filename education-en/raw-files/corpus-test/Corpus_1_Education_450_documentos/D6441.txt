#ITI#Examining Relationships Between Classroom Leadership Styles and Confucian Values: A Study of Korean EFL Learner Preferences#FTI#
#IRE#Little is known about how Confucian cultural values influence the efficacy of classroom leadership styles, which may explain why classes in countries such as South Korea often remain largely teacher-centered. To find out more about Confucian values and correlating preferences for classroom leadership, 57 English as a Foreign Language learners from South Korea were given the Vannsimpco Leadership Survey and a Confucian values survey. Statistical analysis revealed that Korean learners preferred democratic classroom leadership the most. However, learners with strong preferences for traditional Confucian values also preferred autocratic-transformational and democratic-transformational leadership styles. Results appear to suggest that cultural values do indeed influence preferences for classroom leadership. This view is further supported by analysis of Korean students who lived abroad, primarily in non-Confucian countries. These students did not favor autocratic leadership as much as their counterparts, who lived only in South Korea. Overall, findings suggest that an integrated approach to classroom leadership may be needed in Confucian contexts, whereby different styles are tailored to individual needs based on cultural values and personal preferences. © De La Salle University 2023.#FRE#
