#ITI#Family Dinner Frequency, Parent-Organised Informal Learning Activities, and Student Academic Performance: Evidence from Chinese Eighth-Grade Students#FTI#
#IRE#The factors that influence student academic performance have long been discussed by academics. However, to our knowledge, there are no data on the informal learning activities organised by parents. Therefore, there is a need to explore how parents influence student academic performance. To do so, we acquired a dataset from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS) to test the proposed measurements (e.g. the frequency of visiting museums with parents) through regression models. Several findings are summarised in the results. For instance, we found that there is a positive and significant association between parent-organised informal learning activities and student academic performance. Such a linkage can be negatively moderated by students' self-reported course difficulty in some cases (e.g. when students are frequently eating dinner with their parents). In terms of contribution, this study may be one of the first to discuss how parent-organised informal learning activities influence student academic performance. © De La Salle University 2023.#FRE#
