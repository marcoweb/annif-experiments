#ITI#The development of self-perception of ability in Icelandic children with and without specific learning difficulties#FTI#
#IRE#This cohort-sequential study compared the development of self-perception of ability in Icelandic school children with and without learning difficulties (LD). Participants (N = 198) were students with LD (n = 33) in Grade 4 through 8 and their classmates without LD (n = 165). Self-report measures were taken six times to assess students’ perception of their general intellectual ability, reading competence, math competence, and global self-worth from The Self-perception Profile for Learning Disabled Students. Measures were taken during the beginning and end of three consecutive school years covering five grade levels in total. Findings indicate that measures of global self-worth showed a considerable annual positive development (Δz = 0.17) for children with LD from Grade 4 through 8. Students with LD had much lower ability self-perception (d = 0.7–1.3) compared to students without LD across Grade 4 through 8. These results indicate that students with LD meet complex academic challenges from an early age that need immediate attention from school staff and policymakers. © Instituto Universitário de Ciências Psicológicas, Sociais e da Vida 2023.#FRE#
