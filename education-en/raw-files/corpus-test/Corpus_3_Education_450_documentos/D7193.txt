#ITI#Building school capacity for teacher learning in China#FTI#
#IRE#Building school capacity for teacher learning is the competitive advantage that leads to schools’ sustained improvement. Literature has highlighted the importance of school capacity building. However, scant research has explored how schools in the specific contexts practically build their capacity for teacher learning. Using qualitative data collected from six schools in Shanghai, this study developed six strategies being used to build school capacity both at the organisational level (i.e. exercising leadership for teacher learning, nurturing a role-model-setting culture, and facilitating supportive structures) and at the teacher level (i.e. holding student-oriented teaching belief, enhancing personal competence for learning, and engaging in collaborative learning). The study revealed that the effective strategies for promoting the case schools’ capacity for teaching learning were contingent on Chinese cultural and institutional contexts. The practical implications for building school capacity for teacher learning are discussed#FRE#
