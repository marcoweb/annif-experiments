#ITI#Managing problem behavior and the role of metacognitive skills#FTI#
#IRE#Teachers face problem behaviors among children in classrooms of different types and they use positive or negative strategies or both to handle the problem behavior. The objective of the study was to examine to what extent the metacognitive skills of teachers and teacher trainees help in handling problem behaviors of secondary school children effectively. Results showed that the higher the metacognitive skills of the respondents, the higher the skills in using an appropriate strategy in managing the problem behaviors of children which are not very serious in nature. This indicates the need of improving metacognitive skills among secondary school teachers and incorporating training modules in the curriculum of teacher training programs to enhance their skills in managing problem behaviors#FRE#
