#ITI#A review of the empirical research literature on PLCs for teachers in the Global South: evidence, implications, and directions#FTI#
#IRE#This article presents a review of 70 empirical articles focussing on professional learning communities (PLCs) for teachers in the Global South. The review highlights an upward trend in the quantity of the publications on PLCs from 2010 onwards. The evidence suggests that PLCs could be initiated as a result of a mandate, a project of professional development, or needs for mutual support of teachers. This latest review identified evidence on some potential impacts of teachers’ authentic participation in PLCs on their collaborative professional learning, efficacy, innovative teaching, and interpersonal trust building. The conditions for developing and sustaining PLCs include strong leadership support, readiness of infrastructure, focus on learning and teaching, and quality of trusting relationships. The article concludes with some recommendations to diversify and strengthen the evidence base of PLCs and to move forward with this significant model of professional development in the Global South#FRE#
