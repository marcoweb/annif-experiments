#ITI#Creating conditions for professional learning communities (PLCs) in schools in China: the role of school principals#FTI#
#IRE#School principals play a key role in the creation and nurture of school conditions conducive to Professional Learning Communities (PLCs). In China, whereas the term PLC itself is an imported concept and rarely used by school practitioners, the precept of PLCs, collaborative teacher learning activities, are firmly embedded in teachers’ daily work. However, little research has examined the relationships between principalship and PLCs in the country. This article uses data collected from over 100 primary school principals across six regions in China to explore the role principals play in building and sustaining PLCs in Chinese schools. The article specifically asks what Chinese school principals do to create the structural, cultural and relational conditions needed to foster PLCs. The study identifies some common leadership strategies adopted by Chinese principals and related insights into embedding ongoing professional learning in schools#FRE#
