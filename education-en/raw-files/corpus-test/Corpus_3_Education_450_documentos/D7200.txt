#ITI#Fixed or growth: teacher perceptions of factors that shape mindset#FTI#
#IRE#This study focuses on the beliefs of teachers regarding the malleability of their skills, and the factors they consider as enhancing or inhibiting teacher mindset. Fourteen semi-structured interviews were conducted. Findings revealed that both internal factors (e.g. background and success experiences) and external factors (e.g. learning climate, principal support and dictated changes) may enhance teacher growth mindset. Inhibitors included low status, unsupportive environments, and burnout. This qualitative research offers a new understanding of the various factors that teachers believe shape their mindset, and it has practical implications in fostering an attitude of growth among teachers#FRE#
