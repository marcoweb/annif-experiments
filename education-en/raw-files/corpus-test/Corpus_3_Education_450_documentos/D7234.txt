#ITI#How to prepare preservice teachers to deal with disruptions in the classroom? Differential effects of learning with functional and dysfunctional video scenarios#FTI#
#IRE#We designed a video-based intervention to prepare preservice teachers to deal with classroom disruptions. Using tandem cases, we produced staged videos showing a functional scenario, in which a teacher deals effectively with disruptive behaviour, and a dysfunctional scenario, in which a teacher’s behaviour leads to the escalation and spread of the disruption. We addressed two research questions. The first was whether video-based learning arrangements helped preservice teachers to develop three facets of professional vision: noticing critical incidents leading to disruptions, theoretical reflection on these incidents, and the development of appropriate strategies to deal with disruptions. The second was whether functional and dysfunctional video scenarios had different effects on knowledge acquisition, self-efficacy, noticing, reasoning, and the generation of strategies. We used a video test, a multiple-choice test, and a self-efficacy questionnaire to measure the effects in a pre-post design. Our findings show that both groups benefit from the video-based learning arrangements. Differential effects were only found for knowledge acquisition and (not significant) for reasoning#FRE#
