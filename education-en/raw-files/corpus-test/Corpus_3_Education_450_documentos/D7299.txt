#ITI#The 10Cs of project-based learning TESOL curriculum#FTI#
#IRE#Project-based Learning (Project-BL) has become increasingly popular in mainstream education with various models dedicated to the approach, however, there is a need for a Project-BL framework specifically designed for the second language learning context. The model offered here, called the 10Cs of Project-based Learning TESOL Curriculum, tailors Project-BL to the language classroom by utilizing principles from existing models while incorporating elements which specifically emphasise second language development. Further, it positions the target language as both the object and vehicle of learning, meaning students see the project as a meaningful enterprise with which to learn and use English with their peers. The curriculum promotes learner-centred, collaborative engagement, with the teacher acting as a guide throughout the process. The goals of the curriculum are to develop social and affective capacities, linguistic knowledge, communication skills, and to empower students to create projects that are original, purposeful, and rewarding. This article first briefly explains the background of Project-BL then details each stage of the curriculum, using an example project taken from a study conducted with Korean middle-students to exemplify each stage in the process. Finally, the benefits and challenges of the approach are examined through the perspectives of the study’s participants#FRE#
