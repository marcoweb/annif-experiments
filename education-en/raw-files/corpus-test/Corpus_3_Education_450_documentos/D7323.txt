#ITI#The use of individual and collaborative learning logs and their impact on the development of learner autonomy in the EFL classroom in Taiwan#FTI#
#IRE#This paper attempts to investigate and compare two forms of learning logs using Google Sheets–individual and collaborative learning logs–and their effect on EFL university students’ development of learner autonomy over the course of a semester. Subjects were 62 EFL learners from an intact English elective course at a private university in Taiwan. Qualitative data were retrieved from semi-structured and focus-group interviews, log records, and class surveys. Results demonstrate learners’ use of metacognitive strategies in the logging process and the interplay between learner beliefs and their cognitive process as well as emotional intelligences. Benefits of social interaction were also revealed in the use of collaborative learning logs. Finally, problems encountered during the implementation are discussed with proposed solutions offered for researchers and teachers interested in replicating the study#FRE#
