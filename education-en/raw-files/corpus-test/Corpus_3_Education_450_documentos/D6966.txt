#ITI#Lower grade students tend to give up early in multimedia learning#FTI#
#IRE#This study examined the relationship between grade and the ability of text-picture integration in terms of task completion and the pattern of using textual and pictorial information. Children (N = 144) from secondary schools were recruited from grade 5 and grade 8. Analyzing the time spent with the multimedia unit prior to an incorrect response, this study suggests that 5th graders tend to give up relatively early compared to 8th graders. Furthermore, early incorrect responses were more prevalent among students of the non-academic track and were predicted by a low proportion of fixations on the text in mental model construction and on the picture in adaptive mental model specification. An inappropriate approach of integrating text and picture can thus be the reason for giving up early. The work provides a basis for (1) automated feedback during the course of working on a multimedia unit. (2) Instructional design should be adapted to the characteristics of student groups to support text-picture integration and to avoid giving up early#FRE#
