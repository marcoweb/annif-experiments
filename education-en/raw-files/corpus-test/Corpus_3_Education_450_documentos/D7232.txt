#ITI#The professional learning expectations of teachers in different professional development periods#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of the current study was to examine the perceptions of teachers in different professional development periods regarding their experience of traditional activities for continuing professional development (CPD). The participants were 45 teachers from three professional life periods on the basis of teaching experience. Teachers' perceptions of CPD and whether they considered their expectations to be met were examined in semi-structured interviews. About half the participating teachers were very satisfied with the CPD provided. The other half considered that the CPD topic was often irrelevant to their needs and that they could not learn effectively because of many reason. Teachers from all professional life periods criticised the compulsory nature of CPD, with this criticism particularly strong among the experienced group, which was also more likely to complain that CPD offerings were irrelevant. The findings are interpreted in terms of teachers’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations to engage in professional development and whether their developmental aspirations concern their professionalism as teachers or their careers within the education system. As one of a very small number of studies to examine teachers' perceptions of CPD following its comprehensive reform, the findings and implications for CPD provision are likely to be of wide interest#FRE#
