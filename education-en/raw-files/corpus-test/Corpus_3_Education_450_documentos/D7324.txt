#ITI#A multimodal approach to higher order literacy development of low-level EFL university students in Japan#FTI#
#IRE#This mixed methods study investigates the effect of a multimodal reading intervention on EFL reading achievement and intercultural awareness of students (n = 20) at a Japanese university. A cross-culturally themed graphic novel was employed to overcome language barriers and cultural mores and promote higher-order literacy. Asynchronous discourse on the e-learning platform (Edmodo) was analyzed for evidence of higher-order literacy and intercultural awareness development. Wilcoxon signed ranks tests of triggering question responses and peer-to-peer responses on online forums at the beginning and end of term were analyzed for cognitive density. Thematic analysis of an open-ended survey was conducted to gather student perceptions of the graphic novel. Results revealed a significant effect on reading achievement but no significant improvement of intercultural awareness (at α = 0.05). Survey analysis indicated a high degree of student satisfaction with the multimodal literacy instruction and asynchronous computer-mediated discourse (ACMC), as well as other emergent themes. These findings suggest reading instructors of low-level EFL university students should consider employing non-traditional reading and learning modalities, especially for students with high cognitive maturity and low reading proficiency#FRE#
