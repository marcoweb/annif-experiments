#ITI#Comprehensive sexual education and English language teaching: an endeavour from southern Argentina#FTI#
#IRE#Since the enforcement of Law 26,150 (Congreso de la Nación Argentina 2006) through which a national programme on comprehensive sexual education (CSE) was created, the Argentinian educational system must include perspectives, contents, and discursive practices around CSE across the curriculum in kindergarten, primary, secondary, and initial teacher education. English language teaching is not the exception. In this context, CSE is envisaged as a space for encounters among learners, adults, areas of knowledge, public policies, religious beliefs, and cultural traditions in a framework where human rights, gender diversity, respect, and the right to information from early education is central. In this account of classroom inquiry I describe how CSE has brought together educators and authorities to act accordingly to develop innovative teaching practices that respond to Law 26,150. I draw on notions of language-driven content and language integrated learning (CLIL) to describe the practices and initiatives implemented in one Argentinian province to support teachers’ professional development and classroom practices. Implications from this experience could trigger similar practices in contexts where teachers may wish to include topics around gender in foreign language teaching#FRE#
