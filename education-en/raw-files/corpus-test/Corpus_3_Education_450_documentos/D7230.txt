#ITI#Immersive professional activities as learning: Irish teachers learning from overseas volunteering in India#FTI#
#IRE#When centred on the professional exchange of skills and knowledge, overseas volunteering can be a beneficial form of professional development. In contrast to voluntourism where volunteers buy an overseas experience, professional-based overseas volunteering centres on professional collegiality and skill exchange which leads to greater professional engagement for all participants. This research identifies the learning arising from a short-term overseas volunteering exchange between Ireland and India. The volunteers are Irish teachers working with their professional colleagues in India. Intentional professional learning related to their professional contexts can be seen through the themes of the theory/practice divide, experimentation and innovation, and the uncovering of knowledge. It is argued that the recruitment and selection of volunteers by the NGO are viewed as essential stage where attitudes are addressed. Data were collected by in-depth interviews as well as accompanying volunteer groups to India. The paper concludes with a summary of how volunteer professional exchanges need to be distinguished from other forms of volunteering; the work undertaken has benefit to both communities as it reflects collegial values and provides opportunities for professional learning through collaboration and reflection. Differentiation between forms of overseas volunteering is necessary to recognise the positive outcomes of professional volunteering exchanges#FRE#
