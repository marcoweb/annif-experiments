#ITI#Educational experiences and needs of students in out-of-home care: a Delphi study#FTI#
#IRE#Numerous studies show that children and young people in out-of-home care (OOHC) face significant disadvantage in completing high school and accessing post-secondary education. The current research involved a two-round Delphi survey which aimed to identify educational challenges and school reforms to improve the educational experiences of children and young people in OOHC. A total of 45 participants from three OOHC stakeholder groups (carers of children in OOHC, professionals/educators, and young people with lived experience of OOHC) completed the round one survey which consisted of open-ended questions analysed using thematic analysis. In the second survey round, 19 participants completed a Likert scale questionnaire which drew on themes from the round one thematic analysis. Using a consensus threshold of 70% for the round two survey, participants agreed that students in OOHC face a myriad of educational challenges, such as dealing with a history of trauma, frequent home and school transitions, mental health issues and stigma as a result of being in OOHC. It was agreed that teachers lack knowledge and experience, and schools lack support for students in OOHC. Stakeholders recommended provision of greater mental health support, coordination of services and more autonomy for OOHC students regarding their education. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
