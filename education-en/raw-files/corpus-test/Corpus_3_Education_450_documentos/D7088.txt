#ITI#Differing effects of the early sociocultural context on reading for Arabic- and English-speaking students#FTI#
#IRE#The current study examines the effects of the sociocultural context of primary school reading among Arabic- and English-speaking students in the UAE. Using a sample of 16,391 fourth graders (English: n = 10,507; Arabic: n = 5,884) from the 2016 Process in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), results revealed that while early language environment and classroom practices play a role for all students, specific factors differ for Arabic- and English-speaking students. Specifically, the results suggest that some early language variables do not impact later reading achievement for Arabic-speaking students. However, certain classroom practices have a positive effect on Arabic reading in primary school. The discussion focuses on possible explanations of these group differences and the importance of tailoring early language experiences and classroom practices to complement specific linguistic and sociocultural contexts#FRE#
