#ITI#Troubled times and seeds of hope: some reflections on teacher professional learning as praxis development#FTI#
#IRE#This short reflection explores both the challenges and potentials of teacher professional learning in contemporary times. It argues that the neoliberal logics of professional development as deployed in many contexts around the world limit and curtail the potential for teachers to engage in generative professional learning that fosters growth and renewal. It suggests that understanding professional learning as praxis development, as advanced in the papers in this Special Issue provides a source of hope and a critical way forward for educators in these troubled times#FRE#
