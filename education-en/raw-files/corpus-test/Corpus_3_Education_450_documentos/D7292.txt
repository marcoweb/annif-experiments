#ITI#A systems-thinking approach to evaluating a university professional development programme#FTI#
#IRE#Using social constructivist theories of adult learning, the Faculty Pedagogical Development (PD) Programme was designed to offer faculty a unique professional learning experience at one university in Qatar. This study reports on the evaluation of this PD programme that involved 24 participants from different colleges in its first round of implementation. Data collection methods included pre- and post-interview data and multiple journal entries submitted at specific intervals during the PD programme by participants. Through adopting a systems-thinking perspective, this study reveals participants’ perceptions of their professional learning, conceptualised as the change to student-centred beliefs and/or practices, as well as the factors that supported or hindered their learning and change within individual, socio-cultural and structural systems. The conclusion is drawn that PD efforts should consider the systems of influences on faculty professional learning, with implications for the design of PD programmes advocating student-centred approaches in higher education contexts, particularly those locked into traditional teaching approaches#FRE#
