#ITI#Rethinking the role of classroom communication: learning from older learners#FTI#
#IRE#The Purpose: The purpose of this study is to take a fresh look at language education from the perspective of positive communication (PC) as it contributes to the well–being of language learners. It explores a context that has received little attention: older learners. The lessons drawn from older learners can help practitioners in other contexts rethink their approaches and innovate. Design/Methodology/Approach: The interview data was taken from a research project on life stories of language learners. The participants, all over the age of 65, are students an English discussion class in Japan. The transcripts were thematically coded to identify elements of L2 communication that encourage them to continue learning. Findings: The identified themes are compatible with the six concepts of Mirivel’s PC model (2014. The Art of Positive Communication. Peter Lang) and suggest that PC in L2 can encourage learners to connect, stimulate, and support each other which leads to the sustained engagement. Originality/value: The study makes a contribution to the field by bringing attention to the potential of L2 communication from a new perspective. It explores areas where formal classroom learning and informal out of class learning intersect, and calls for a reexamination of communication in the language classroom#FRE#
