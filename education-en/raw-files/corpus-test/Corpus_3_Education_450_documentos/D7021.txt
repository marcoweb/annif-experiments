#ITI#Can metacognitive accuracy be altered through prompting in biology text reading?#FTI#
#IRE#Metacognitive accuracy is understood as the congruency of subjective evaluation and objectively measured learning performance. With reference to the cue utilisation framework and the embedded-processes model of working memory, we proposed that prompts impact attentional processes during learning. Through guided prompting, learners place their attention on specific information during the learning process. We assumed that the information will be taken into account when comprehension judgments are formed. Subsequently, metacognitive accuracy will be altered. Based on the results of this online study with pre-service biology teachers, we can neither confirm nor reject our main hypothesis and assume small effects of prompting on metacognitive accuracy if there are any. Learning performance and judgment of comprehension were not found to be impacted by the use of resource- and deficit-oriented prompting. Other measurements of self-evaluation (i.e. satisfaction with learning outcome and prediction about prolonged comprehension) were not influenced through prompting. The study provides merely tentative evidence for altered metacognitive accuracy and effects on information processing through prompting. Results are discussed in light of online learning settings in which the effectiveness of prompt implementation might have been restricted compared to a classroom environment. We provide recommendations for the use of prompts in learning settings with the aim to facilitate their effectiveness, so that both resource-oriented and deficit-oriented prompts can contribute to metacognitive skill development if they are applied appropriately. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
