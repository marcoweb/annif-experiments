#ITI#A different difference in teacher education: posthuman and decolonizing perspectives#FTI#
#IRE#In this paper we propose that posthuman and decolonizing perspectives on difference might provide a foundation for English as an additional language (EAL) teacher education programs. We briefly examine current outcomes of schooling for EAL students and current teacher education in Canada, showing the necessity and urgency of developing practices for equity. We then discuss posthuman perspectives on difference and their intersections with decolonizing scholarship. Finally, we speculate that EAL teacher education that employs posthuman and decolonizing views might aid us in reconceptualising language education, de-centre Whiteness, ‘native speakerism’ and the white gaze around which concepts of difference and diversity have been assembled#FRE#
