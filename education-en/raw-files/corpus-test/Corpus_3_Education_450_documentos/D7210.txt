#ITI#Investigating the PDR process in a UK university: continuing professional development or performativity?#FTI#
#IRE#Over recent years, the professional development review process has risen in importance in universities with such exercises being shown to have a positive effect on student learning, staff motivation, recruitment and retention. However, they may also be perceived as a controlling mechanism and part of a culture of ‘performativity’, which implies a lack of trust, an undermining of autonomy and a reliance on externally driven targets to ‘manage’ staff. However, there is very little published research in this area. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by drawing on data from a Leadership Foundation funded study in a UK University which included 30 interviews and a follow-up survey (n = 177) with both leaders and the staff they lead. The findings suggest that both leaders and staff felt that the process was potentially very important and could offer significant levels of guidance and support for professional development. However, they stressed the importance of a review structure which was adaptable, more professionally relevant, and less reliant on over-ambitious target setting#FRE#
