#ITI#Perceptions of Digital Learning and Teaching: The Case of a Croatian University Transition to an Emergency Digital Environment#FTI#
#IRE#This research aims to analyse the self-perception of teachers and students on their digital readiness and their attitudes towards digital and distance learning, as well as the potential influence of other factors. The use of digital technologies is directly linked to the academic performance of students and teachers, while also enabling new modes of the teaching–learning process. Considering the pandemic disruptions, the self-perception of Croatian university students and teachers was analysed, exploring the relationship and differences between groups. The results indicate significant digital readiness gaps, considering gender and the field of study. From a substantive point of view, the use and application of digital tools show a disconnect between expectations of digital transformation in the learning environment and reality. Existing environments and practices are augmented digitally without building new and improved learning systems. The findings of this study provide insights to reduce the existing gaps and improve the digital teaching and learning environment. Higher education institutions have a unique opportunity to increase their antifragility by leveraging new experiences gained during the pandemic, while also valuing their pre-existing institutional agility. The research has practical implications that can assist educators and policymakers in creating a digital learning environment that is more inclusive and beneficial to all participants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
