#ITI#The roles of the academic in health sciences: where to start from a faculty development perspective#FTI#
#IRE#In an effort to offer a more focussed and competency-based approach to faculty development for newly appointed academics, this study prioritised the roles of the medical teacher, focussing on orientation initiatives. At a research-led university, we used 15 roles of a medical teacher. Health science academics were asked which professional development activities should be available to newly appointed educators with reference to teaching-learning and research development. Quantitative and descriptive research were followed, using a self-administered questionnaire which was completed by 129/256 (50%) health science academics. The top five roles were ranked as follows: Role Model for Students (83.6%); Information Provider in the Classroom (82.8%); Facilitator of Learning (78.1%); Information Provider in the Clinical Setting (75.0%); and Assessor of Student Learning (74.4%). Although research development was ranked important, respondents indicated that it should receive attention at a later stage and not necessarily during orientation. Academics (90.6%) indicated that professional career development should be individualised. Faculty development should encourage gradual development over time, addressing all the roles of the academic, including research. At different institutions, various roles are considered important; and institutional research should be done to guide faculty development#FRE#
