#ITI#Guiding thesis circles in higher education: towards a typology#FTI#
#IRE#Although the thesis is an integral part of the study programme, the way the guidance for this work is supervised can highly differ between supervisors. Writing the thesis is a complicated process requiring tailored guidance, that is often not feasible due to increasing numbers of students and need for efficiency. One possible solution is working with thesis circles: small collaborative groups in which students, together with one or more supervisors, conduct research on the same subject or theme. Thesis circles offer opportunities for self-regulated learning, (peer) feedback and prevention of feelings of loneliness. In this study we construct a typology for thesis circles aimed at supervisors following an Educational Design Research (EDR) approach. Based on a literature review and interviews, we formulate the boundaries of a thesis circle and identify 23 design characteristics that determine an instantiation of a thesis circle. This is developed into a typology, that is evaluated in a focus group. Avenues for future research are presented#FRE#
