#ITI#Effective collaborative learning for early childhood teachers: structural, motivational and sustainable features#FTI#
#IRE#Research on teachers’ professional learning and development (PLD) has investigated the nature and design of such learning initiatives, itemising characteristics that promote high-quality PLD and outcomes for individual teachers. However, much learning for teachers happens as they work together to consider and discuss their ability to implement their new learning. Features that create teacher collaboration have not been as explicitly pinpointed within the existing literature. We report a content analysis of literature aimed at identifying and grouping features of what we term ‘teachers’ collaborative learning’ (TCL), specifically for early childhood teachers. Three interdependent themes that promote collaboration were identified. First, structural features reflect how effective TCL is organised. Second, motivational features promote the depth and quality of teachers’ learning experience. The third set of features are those that promote sustainability of both changes and improvements in teaching and learning arising from TCL. We argue that an understanding of effective TCL for early childhood teachers is enhanced when many of these features function together cohesively. We conclude with evidence-based considerations for designing PLD. We highlight the need to address power differences in PLD, respond to cultural issues affecting knowledge building, and understand challenges faced in teachers sustaining collaborative learning#FRE#
