#ITI#Incorporating Collaborative and Active Learning Strategies in the Design and Deployment of a Master Course on Computer-Assisted Scientific Translation#FTI#
#IRE#This research aims to address the current gaps in computer-assisted translation (CAT) courses offered in bachelor’s and master’s programmes in scientific and technical translation (STT). A multi-framework course design methodology is proposed to support CAT teachers from the computer engineering field, improve student engagement, and promote computer-supported education, together with a balanced coverage of the most relevant topics in the CAT domain. STT is currently in high demand in many fields, requiring translators with sector-specific language skills and considerable computer literacy in order to manage translation projects with complex structures, and format heterogeneity. However, many STT curricula often lag behind current market demands, focusing primarily on language and translation theory, with less emphasis on CAT technologies and tools. Moreover, the lack of shared course design guidelines hinders the introduction of innovative teaching approaches based on collaborative learning. A novel multi-framework CAT course design methodology, named CATDeM, is proposed, based on the integration between an official European translation competence framework, real-life-mimicking laboratorial activities, and computer-supported collaborative learning, enriched with discussion case studies and role-playing experiences. A real-life case study is examined to illustrate and evaluate the implementation of CATDeM in two consecutive editions (2020/2021 and 2021/2022) of a one-semester compulsory CAT course in a M.A. degree in STT at the University of Salento (Italy). Students’ perceptions of translation technology and role-plays, as well as their attitudes towards the proposed CAT course are evaluated through a post-grading self-assessment questionnaire. Achieved results indicated successful student engagement and self-assessed improvement in translation, technical, and interpersonal skills. The importance given by students to role-playing experiences mimicking professional scenarios was also highlighted, paving the way for CATDeM to be adopted in similar contexts. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
