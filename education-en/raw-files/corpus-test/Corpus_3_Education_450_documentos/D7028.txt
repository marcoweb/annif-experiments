#ITI#Exploring the relations of executive functions with emotional, linguistic, and cognitive skills in preschool children: parents vs. teachers reports#FTI#
#IRE#This study investigated the executive functions (EF) of preschool children and their associations with emotional, linguistic, and cognitive skills, using parent and teacher reports. A total of 130 children aged 34 to 71 months participated. The preschool version of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-P) was completed by both parents and teachers to assess behavioral difficulties in the use of EFs, while children were administered the Test of Emotion Comprehension (TEC), the Test of Language Evaluation (TVL), and the Coloured Progressive Matrices (CPM). Statistical analyses revealed significant differences between parents’ and teachers’ reports, with parents attributing to children more EF difficulties than parents. Children’s EF difficulties were negatively associated with emotion comprehension, language ability, and non-verbal intelligence, although correlations were stronger when using teachers’ reports. The value of using indirect measurement of preschoolers’ EF problems and the importance of adopting a multi-informant approach are discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
