#ITI#Providing quality improvement workplace-based professional development to Australian general practice clinical educators: findings from a feasibility study#FTI#
#IRE#In Australia, doctors undertaking advanced training to become general practitioners work under the supervision of clinical educators. Primarily clinicians, these clinical educators participate in one day of teaching-related professional development annually, generally a workshop. Shortcomings with this form of professional development led to the development of a quality improvement focused intervention that is facilitated in the workplace and based on the clinical educator’s self-identified concerns. Drawing on teacher action research and feasibility study methodologies we explored this novel form of professional development by asking ‘Can this intervention work?’ We employed an embedded multiple case study design, trialling the intervention in four settings. The intervention’s constituent activities were acceptable to participants; including a preparedness to experience discomfort for the purpose of improving their teaching practices. They perceived the intervention as convenient and the workload manageable. Participants were motivated to experiment with new teaching behaviours, but measuring outcomes was challenging. Medical educators facilitating the intervention perceived their tasks as cognitively ‘hard work’. The findings provide support for this workplace-based intervention as a feasible form of professional development, which should be implemented on a larger scale and evaluated for impact#FRE#
