#ITI#Multimodal input during technology-assisted teacher instruction and English learner's learning experience#FTI#
#IRE#The proliferation of educational technologies has had a profound impact on the dynamics of education and has raised questions regarding how the nature of teaching and learning should be conceptualized. This study explores how the use of technology mediates class interaction, shapes class discourse, and supports the English learners’ language development. This study's findings show that technology worked as a mediational tool in the classroom to influence class interactions and student learning experience. The study also draws our attention to the important role of the teacher in orchestrating multimodal interactions and providing learners with clear intentions of multiple modes and with necessary linguistic scaffolding, suggesting that teachers should be mindful of the role that social interactions play in achieving an intended pedagogical purpose with the use of computer tools#FRE#
