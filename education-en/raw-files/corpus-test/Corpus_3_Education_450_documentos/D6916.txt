#ITI#Implementation and Evaluation of an Adaptive Learning Environment Designed According to Learner Characteristics: A Study on Primary School Social Studies Teaching#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, it was aimed to implement and evaluate an adaptive learning environment (ALE) designed according to the learner characteristics of 4th grade primary school students and integrate educational hypermedia environments with face-to-face teaching. Via a preliminary study carried out in accordance with this purpose, the variables that affect the academic achievement of the students in the primary school social studies course were analyzed, and as a result of this analysis, the design, application, and evaluation criteria of ALE were determined. In our study, which was modeled as an embedded-experimental mixed method, quantitative and qualitative data were obtained using different tools. The analysis of the data revealed that the designed learning environment had a positive effect on students' academic achievements, collaborative learning skills, and, partially, independent learning skills, and it was also effective in closing the achievement gap due to learning and cognitive styles. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022.#FRE#
