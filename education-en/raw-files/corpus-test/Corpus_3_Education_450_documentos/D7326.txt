#ITI#Learning experiences in and outside class by successful Vietnamese tertiary students studying English as a foreign language#FTI#
#IRE#This article focuses on the roles of students in creating opportunities to practise their learning in class and out of class. This case study with four successful tertiary English as a foreign language (EFL) learners was conducted in a blended language learning environment to investigate these students’ beliefs and practice of learner autonomy in the Vietnamese EFL context. For in-class learning, students mostly played a passive role in their learning practice. They preferred teacher-led learning and evaluation, or test-oriented practice. Practice activities in class were often exam-driven, tailored by the teacher to suit test contents and formats. For out-of-class learning, students actively and creatively generated practice opportunities through part-time jobs, social activities, and hobbies more targeted at developing language skills than at high test scores. The study provides new insight into learner practice of autonomy within and beyond the classroom, and offers suggestions on how to bridge the two settings#FRE#
