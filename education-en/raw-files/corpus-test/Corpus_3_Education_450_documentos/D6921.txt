#ITI#Transitioning from Individuals to Groups in Knowledge Map Construction#FTI#
#IRE#Students employing problem-based learning (PBL) face complex problems admitting multiple solutions. Knowledge maps are an effective tool to support students in PBL to represent, analyze, and guide their knowledge structure. Previous studies have examined the use of knowledge mapping techniques in both individual and collaborative learning process. These studies explored how knowledge mapping influenced students’ learning outcomes and their knowledge understanding, but they did not document how the map structure changed when shifting from individual to collaborative mapping process. In this work-in-process study, we collected maps from students first as individuals and then as they collaboratively worked in groups to solve a case. We examined two questions: (Q1) how does the structure of a map change when shifting from individuals to groups, and (Q2) how does the size of a group mediate these changes. We used 12 network science metrics capturing the breadth (e.g., number of edges) and complexity (e.g., number of cycles) of problems and compared these metrics in individuals versus groups (Q1) and across group sizes (Q2). Based on 44 individual maps arranged in 10 groups of four or five students, we found that (1) five metrics significantly differ (p < 0.05 in a one-way ANOVA) between individual and group maps; and (2) only the number of edges and paths are affected by the size of a group (based on Tukey's HSD test). Our first result confirms that learner-learner interactions can enhance performance. The second result shows that group sizes of four or five students have no implications on the results, hence instructors who may currently be hesitating between these two options may choose either size. Future studies may reveal whether differences exist between pairs, medium group sizes, or larger groups. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
