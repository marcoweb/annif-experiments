#ITI#Obstructions in normative teacher identity development: a case study in Turkey#FTI#
#IRE#This paper reports, through a longitudinal case inquiry, on the trajectory of one novice teacher’s professional identity development after completing his pre-service education to become an English teacher in Turkey. He was assigned to a school in the south-east of the country, which has been experiencing worsening civil conflict between regional militants and the national government, characterised by long-lasting curfews and the destruction of buildings and homes. This study provides insights into the formation of a new teacher’s professional identity when working within a conflict region. Written narratives, informal interviews, observation notes, university supervisor observations and a teaching diary were used to examine the developing professional identity. The findings suggest that, in extreme circumstances, individuals may adapt and find ways to mitigate the effects of a challenging community and other disadvantages. Imagined identity can play a powerful role in mediating external difficulties encountered in identity development#FRE#
