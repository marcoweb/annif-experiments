#ITI#They need to know that they are loved: exploring the deeper needs of English language learners#FTI#
#IRE#This paper explores a volunteer teaching project that set out to meet a school’s need for English instruction and instead encountered other more profound needs. This case study investigates these needs as they emerged in the written and oral reflections of the four volunteer teachers. In tandem with the teaching project, the study found that the needs of learners were broader and deeper than a lack of English instruction. Drawing on the volunteer teachers’ reflections, recommendations are made for the school and village where the teaching project took place. An attempt is also made to consider what English language teachers may be able to learn. From the heart of the investigation emerges a human need for love#FRE#
