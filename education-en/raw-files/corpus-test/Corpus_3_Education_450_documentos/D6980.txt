#ITI#Patterns of symbolic numerical magnitude processing and working memory as predictors of early mathematics performance#FTI#
#IRE#Although the roles of symbolic numerical magnitude processing (SNMP) and working memory (WM) in mathematics performance are well acknowledged, studies examining their joint effects are few. Here, we investigated the profiles of SNMP (1- and 2-digit comparison) and WM (verbal, visual and central executive) among Norwegian first graders (N = 256), and how these predict performance in counting, arithmetic facts and word problem–solving. Using latent class cluster analysis, four groups were identified: (1) weak SNMP (33.6%), (2) strong SNMP (25.8%), (3) weak SNMP and WM (23.4%) and (4) strong WM (17.2%). Group differences in mathematics performance were significant with explained variance ranging from 7 to 16%, even after controlling for relevant demographics and domain-general cognitive skills. Our findings suggest that children may display relative strengths in SNMP and WM, and that they both have a unique, even compensatory role in mathematics performance#FRE#
