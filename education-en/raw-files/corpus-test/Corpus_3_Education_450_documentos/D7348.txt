#ITI#Improving text comprehension in ESL learners: a multichannel approach#FTI#
#IRE#Purpose: This paper is a proposal for improving ESL text comprehension by merging a multimodal perspective on language (Kress et al. [2005]. Urban Classrooms, Subject English: Multimodal Perspectives on Teaching and Learning. London: Routledge Falmer.) with an integrated psychological (or ‘metacognitive’) approach to language learning and awareness (Fairclough [1992]. Critical Language Awareness. London: Longman, 1). Design: A multichannel approach is presented, based on two strategies: a main ‘multichannel’ strategy for reading the text, which focuses on the assessment of the visual, auditory, cognitive and kinaesthetic/emotional channels and relative functions, and a corollary one, specifically dedicated to implementing the cognitive function. Methodology/approach: The approach has been extensively applied in university-level English classes (Reggio Emilia, Parma, Bologna University) using a ‘multichannel test’ based on students’ feedback to explore the effectiveness of the method. In this paper, a case study is offered: data have been collected with specific reference to the University of Bologna, A. Y. 2017/18 and 2018/2019. Originality/value: Evidence suggests that further and diversified applications promise an empowerment of the approach and of its impact on ELT as well as on students’ awareness and satisfaction#FRE#
