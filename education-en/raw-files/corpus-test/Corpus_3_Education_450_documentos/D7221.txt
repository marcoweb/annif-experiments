#ITI#Technology-mediated professional development for early intervention service providers: connecting adult learning with caregiver support#FTI#
#IRE#High quality, easily accessible professional development is needed to ensure that service providers are well-qualified to facilitate early intervention (EI) that targets caregiver learning during visits with children and families. This research evaluated a multi-component, technology-mediated inservice training course entitled, Using Adult Learning Strategies to Support Caregivers during Early Intervention Visits. This 6-week course included ongoing, embedded support and was provided for nine EI service providers. A mixed methods intervention evaluation was conducted using a within-subjects pre-post-test design to determine the effects of participation on: 1) service providers’ use of four EI adult learning strategies (e.g., reflective conversation, caregiver practice with feedback, collaborative problem-solving, and joint planning); 2) providers’ changes in knowledge about adult learning and how to apply learned strategies; and 3) providers’ perceptions of course effectiveness. Analysis of pre-post videos revealed increases in the use of caregiver practice with feedback and collaborative problem-solving strategies with participation in the course. Participants showed a statistically significant gain in knowledge, with very large effects, especially related to applying adult learning to EI service delivery. All participants rated the overall training as ‘excellent’ and strongly agreed the format was more effective than a single workshop#FRE#
