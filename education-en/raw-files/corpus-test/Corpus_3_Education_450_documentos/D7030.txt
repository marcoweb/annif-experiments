#ITI#A three-stage model for developing social competence in teased students#FTI#
#IRE#Teasing among children is frequent in school life. Continued exposure to verbal abuse has negative effects on children’s development, including damage to their feeling of safeness and their self-image, withdrawal, and avoiding social situations. This essay focuses on developing the social competence of children who face continuing situations such as these, i.e., developing their ability to defend themselves psychologically and practically. It is based on a combination of a review of the literature and practice-based knowledge, and its main contribution is in organizing the ideas and presenting them in a three-stage methodical model that is intended for implementation in educational contexts, as part of social-emotional learning (SEL). Each stage is explained while linking it to the world of the educator. Developing competence to cope with teasing will contribute to the mental welfare of all students and help them to conduct themselves in a multicultural democratic society. © Instituto Universitário de Ciências Psicológicas, Sociais e da Vida 2023.#FRE#
