#ITI#Gender-math stereotypes and mathematical performance: the role of attitude toward mathematics and math self-concept#FTI#
#IRE#Gender-math stereotypes are thought to be a threat for women’s mathematical performance, however, the mechanism of gender stereotype affecting mathematics achievement is not clear. The current study aimed to explore the different role of attitude towards mathematics and math self-concept in the relationship between gender-math stereotypes and mathematical performance for men and women. A total of 297 Chinese college students participated in our survey. Results showed that math self-concept played a suppressing effect on the relationship between gender-math stereotypes and women’s mathematical performance, while attitude had no mediating role in the relationship between gender stereotypes and mathematical performance. However, gender-math stereotypes could not directly predict men’s mathematical performance, nor could it predict through math self-concept or attitude towards mathematics#FRE#
