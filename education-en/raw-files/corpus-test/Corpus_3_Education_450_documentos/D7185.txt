#ITI#The contribution of teachers of research-intensive teacher education programmes to a culture of inquiry in primary schools#FTI#
#IRE#A culture of inquiry in schools, where teachers work collaboratively and inquiry based, can contribute to the quality of education. It is assumed that teachers of research-intensive teacher education programmes can play an important role in creating such a culture. Little is known, however, about how these teachers function. This case-study research investigates how primary school teachers of research-intensive teacher education programmes in the Netherlands contribute to a culture of inquiry and which factors influence this. In five schools semi-structured interviews were conducted with a teacher and her/his school leader. Also school policy documents were analysed and team meetings were observed. The teachers contributed to a culture of inquiry in their schools in three ways, by 1) initiating collective critical reflection on school policy, 2) sharing knowledge with colleagues and 3) initiating innovations. According to the teachers, self-efficacy in collaboration with colleagues in inquiry-based working and a formal research position in the school facilitates the contribution they can make to a culture of inquiry#FRE#
