#ITI#Professional learning in engineering internships: what do supervisors learn from their student supervision practices?#FTI#
#IRE#In order to graduate as professional engineers in Australia, engineering students undertake internships as part of their degree programmes. The heart of a productive internship programme is the relationship between the workplace supervisor and the student, yet there are significant gaps in the knowledge about the nature and type of professional learning that takes place for industry supervisors. The aim of this research is thus to develop a clearer understanding of their practices and perceptions of their student supervision, and the types of learning that take place. This study was conducted with industry supervisors of students from the Faculty of Engineering and IT in an Australian university. It adopted a qualitative research approach using semi-structured interviews and an online survey. The data were analysed through the lens of practice theory perspectives. Our results show that learning was generally confined to the learning of students. Supervisors generally did not position themselves as potential learners in the internship experiences. The deeper understanding gained from this study calls for more purposeful, relational and values-based learning practices in supervisor-student interactions#FRE#
