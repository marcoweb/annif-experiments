#ITI#Professional training of health professionals to work in schools with school integration programmes in Chile: a mixed-methods analysis#FTI#
#IRE#Research on inclusive education focus shows that one barrier which occurs worldwide is a lack of early training among teachers. However, little is known about the professional training of healthcare professionals who are incorporated into schools to support teachers. For the first time, we explore the perceptions of speech therapists, psychologists, physical therapists, and occupational therapists about the professional training they receive to work within schools with School Integration Programmes in Chile. Via a sequential exploratory mixed research method, semi-structured interviews were done (n = 52) and an online survey was applied (n = 474) with a respondent-driven sampling method. The results converge, indicating that professional training is insufficient to fulfil its educational role. We also observed a dichotomy between the role defined by policy and professional training, and how post-graduate training reconciles professional identity with the educational role. We hope that these findings contribute to opening a reflection space about the development, disciplinary connection, and research of health professionals working in schools. These results have practical implications for universities which provide training and formation, as well as for policymakers and researchers who promote an inclusive focus worldwide#FRE#
