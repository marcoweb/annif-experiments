#ITI#Differential instructional effectiveness: overcoming the challenge of learning to solve trigonometry problems that involved algebraic transformation skills#FTI#
#IRE#The design principles of cognitive load theory and learning by analogy has independently contributed to our understanding why an instruction will or will not work. In an experimental study involving 97 Year 9 Australian students conducted in regular classrooms, we evaluated the effect of the unguided problem-solving approach, worked examples approach and analogy approach on learning to solve two types of trigonometry problem. These trigonometry problems (sin40° = x6 vs. cos50° = 14x) exhibited two levels of complexity owing to the location of the pronumeral (numerator vs. denominator). The solution procedure of worked examples provided guidance, whereas the unguided problem-solving was without any guidance. Analogical learning placed emphasis on comparing a pair of isomorphic examples to facilitate transfer. Across the three approaches, solving practice problems contributed towards performance on the post-test. However, the worked examples approach and analogy approach were more efficient than the unguided problem-solving approach for acquiring skills to solve practice problems regardless of their complexity. Therefore, the worked examples approach and analogy approach that emphasizes algebraic transformation skills have the potential to reform instructional efficiency for learning to solve trigonometry problems#FRE#
