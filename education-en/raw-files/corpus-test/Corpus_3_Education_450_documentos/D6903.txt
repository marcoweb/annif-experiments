#ITI#Intention Among Information Technology Professionals to Adopt Paid MOOCs from E-Learning Platforms: An Empirical Study#FTI#
#IRE#Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) can be considered an important tool for professionals to reskill and upskill as well as a cost-efficient way to stay relevant. However, evidence-based research is still needed to identify why specific categories of people, especially professionals, take paid MOOCs. The paper aims to analyze the factors that influence IT working Professionals to adopt paid MOOCs using the UTAUT 2 model. Based on a survey conducted on 250 respondents, the study uses multiple regression to understand the significance of factors affecting the intention to adopt paid MOOCs. A multigroup analysis was also done to understand the differences among different age groups and genders. The results establish that social influence, facilitating conditions, brand credibility and price value are significant in the adoption of MOOCs. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and curiosity were found to be insignificant. Based on the research findings, the implication of the study and future scope for research have been suggested. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
