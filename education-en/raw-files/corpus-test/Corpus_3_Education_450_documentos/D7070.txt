#ITI#Axiological constellations in literary response writing: Critical SFL praxis in an ELA classroom#FTI#
#IRE#To engage in critical praxis, teachers of literary response writing need concepts and methods for understanding the efficacy of teaching practices in helping students develop particular dispositions towards texts and the social issues they represent. In this article, the author uses concepts from Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) and Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) to reveal the value positions constructed by 8th grade English language arts (ELA) students in essays produced in a critical literary analysis unit. After reading excerpts from two Harry Potter novels, students compared the main characters’ views on elvish enslavement as evidenced by the passages. This study uses axiological constellation analysis to explore the language choices in essays that constructed contrasting stances towards Harry’s character and the representation of elvish enslavement in the texts. The study contributes to understanding how values are constructed in literary response writing and how these relate to broader sociopolitical discourses, with implications for critical praxis in subject English education#FRE#
