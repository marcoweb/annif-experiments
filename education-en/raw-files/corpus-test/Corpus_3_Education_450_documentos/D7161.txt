#ITI#Critical professional development and the racial justice leadership possibilities of teachers of colour in K-12 schools#FTI#
#IRE#Research has noted that teachers of Color are disproportionately called upon to address racialized issues in schools serving students of Color. And although many teachers of Color enter the profession wanting to advocate for and with students and their families and are strongly positioned to do so, these responsibilities should not rest entirely on their shoulders. Navigating institutional change as collective work is not something taught within teacher preparation or traditional professional development (PD). But what would happen if critical teachers of Color—those with a structural analysis of oppression and who are committed to social and racial justice—were actually supported and provided leadership development work towards racial justice at their school sites? How might this type of development affect their sustainability in and impact on the field? Using a framework of critical professional development (CPD)—emergent and often grassroots teacher development spaces that frame teachers as politically-aware individuals who have a stake transforming society—this paper will explore the impacts of a racial affinity CPD space, the Institute for Teachers of Color Committed to Racial Justice, designed specifically to promote the retention, growth, and activist leadership of teachers of Color in K-12 schools#FRE#
