#ITI#A pedagogical framework for digital multimodal composing in the English Language classroom#FTI#
#IRE#With the increasing recognition in the importance of multiliteracies, this study argues for the need to develop a pedagogical framework to teach and support students’ digital multimodal composing practices, such as video production, in the classroom. The framework, informed by Systemic Functional Theory and Design Thinking, organises the knowledge and skills of digital multimodal practices into the critical, creative, and technical domains. Based on the framework, we develop a lesson package, comprising four lessons, which was implemented in a secondary school English Language classroom in Singapore. These findings suggest that rather than assuming students are intuitively capable of digital multimodal composing skills, a pedagogical framework that guides their development and demonstration of these skills can be useful#FRE#
