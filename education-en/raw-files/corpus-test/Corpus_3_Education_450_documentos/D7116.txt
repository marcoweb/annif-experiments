#ITI#Gender-fair language in English language teaching: insights from teachers in Philippine higher education institutions#FTI#
#IRE#Although the literature has recognized the successes and challenges resulting from the implementation of gender-fair language (GFL) policies in the school domain and beyond, students and teachers still struggle in engaging with topics concerning gender identity and expression, and in integrating the micro-aspects of gender-nonconforming vocabulary and topics related to gender and sexuality. In the Philippine English language teaching (ELT) context, research on how English language teachers navigate the difficult and ideologically laden terrains of GFL in the classroom has remained underexplored. Through a qualitative survey among 31 Filipino college teachers of English and follow-up email interviews, this paper analyzes the teacher-participants’ insights about GFL and its place in ELT, and ways of integrating GFL into the classroom. Findings indicated that GFL ensures inclusivity and promotes visibility of genders, and challenges deep-seated norms of gender asymmetry. The teachers likewise reported that incorporating GFL in ELT helps develop students’ social skills and fosters an inclusive learning space. Regarding ways in integrating GFL into ELT, they used GFL- and gender-themed instructional materials, and facilitated class interactions and activities that promote GFL and gender inclusivity#FRE#
