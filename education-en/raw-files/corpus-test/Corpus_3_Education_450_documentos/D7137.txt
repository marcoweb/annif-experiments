#ITI#Rethinking linguistic capitals and asset-based language learning: an examination of bilingual Korean-Chinese instruction for international students in South Korea#FTI#
#IRE#This exploratory study attempts to understand how bilingual instruction can be incorporated effectively in a non-English speaking higher education context by examining the effectiveness of bilingual Korean instruction for Chinese international students at a South Korean university. Using quantitative and qualitative data sources consisting of an end-of-semester survey (n = 42) and individual in-depth interviews (n = 6), descriptive statistical analysis of the survey, and thematic analysis of qualitative data presents three major findings. First, bilingual instruction for Korean language learners facilitated dynamic social interactions. Second, Korean-Chinese bilingual instruction facilitated learners’ emotional engagement in language learning. Third, Korean instructors’ use of bilingual approaches for grammar instruction, sentence semantic descriptions, and error corrections benefited learners’ language acquisition and overall academic skills development. Fourth, while Korean language learners were generally satisfied with bilingual instruction, some evaluative feedback challenges the deeply rooted monolingual norms and principles. Finally, recommendations and implications are provided for effective bilingual and translanguaging pedagogic approaches in Korean higher education contexts#FRE#
