#ITI#The role of experiences in the origin and development of theoretical and practical knowledge during teacher training#FTI#
#IRE#The relationship between theory and practice in teacher training has been discussed extensively in the world of education. Both theoretical and practical knowledge are fundamental to teachers’ engagement in educational activities. However, the question of where this knowledge comes from and how it develops over time has yet to be answered. As such, there is an enduring need to revisit this discussion in light of a series of works that address, from a socio-cultural perspective, the importance of the meanings associated with this knowledge. We propose that knowledge held by teachers arises and evolves as a consequence of the narrative construction of certain subjective learning experiences. These experiences enable the emergence of meanings associated with identity positions, facilitating or hindering alignment or fit between theoretical and practical knowledge#FRE#
