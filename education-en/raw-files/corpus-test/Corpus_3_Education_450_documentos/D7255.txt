#ITI#Professional development for inclusive and adaptive education: Lesson Study in a Norwegian context#FTI#
#IRE#This article presents findings from a study examining teacher talk in the early and late phases of a 4-year project in a Norwegian elementary school where Lesson Study was used as a method for professional development. The study focuses on inclusive and adapted education and aims to explore the changing beliefs about student needs and the adaptations teachers made to meet these needs. To this end, the study applies content analysis to audio recordings of teachers planning meetings. Findings show development in how teachers understand themselves and their work in ways that can contribute to education that is more inclusive and adapted: 1) an increased awareness of student needs paired with a growing trust in students’ ability to participate in the lessons; 2) more trust in teachers’ own ability to influence student learning and development and; 3) a growing view of teaching and learning as a social enterprise where the active participation of all students is identified and used as a lesson resource#FRE#
