#ITI#A classroom station work on the Wadden Sea and its influence on the motivation and interest#FTI#
#IRE#Modern, student-oriented teaching can be characterized by the promotion of autonomy and interest. In the school subject of biology, it is necessary to focus on different ecosystems from different aspects. One ecosystem that has hardly been considered in biology didactics so far is the UNESCO World Heritage Wadden Sea. Therefore, this study implemented station work in a biology class as a method of teaching educational content on the Wadden Sea to determine the effects on the learners’ intrinsic motivation as well as on their situational and individual interest. A total of 157 students from secondary schools (age: M = 14.4 years, SD = 0.5) participated in the study. The results indicate that station work has a statistically significant positive effect on the aforementioned constructs. To clarify the relationship between the two constructs from the literature, the scales used were related to each other in a correlation analysis, revealing a significant correlation between interest and motivation. The findings of this study lay an important foundation for the school-based consideration of the Wadden Sea in biology education research and also provide important implications for related studies. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
