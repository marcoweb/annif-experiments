#ITI#The effects of L2 motivational strategies: within and beyond the L2 classroom#FTI#
#IRE#Previous studies have associated L2 teachers’ use of motivational strategies with learners’ motivated behaviours in class such as raised attention and participation. The after-class effects of L2 motivational strategies, in contrast, have drawn less attention. This paper reports a study examining how L2 teachers’ motivational interventions cause changes in learners’ perceived attitudes and behaviours, both within and beyond the L2 classroom. To this end, 84 reflective journals were collected over one semester from 42 tertiary students in Hong Kong enrolled in a range of English courses. The results indicate that reported increases in the use of additional self-learning materials, attempts to put newly acquired English knowledge into practice, efforts to reduce mistakes, and in-class engagement were attributable to L2 teachers’ motivational efforts. This provides evidence that the benefits brought by L2 teachers’ motivational practice can transcend the classroom#FRE#
