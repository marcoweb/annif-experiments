#ITI#Virtual team professional learning and development for practitioners in education#FTI#
#IRE#Surprisingly little has been written about the notion of virtual teams in schooling contexts and less on the role of virtual teams in the professional learning and development (PLD) of teachers. Virtual teams are groups that use technologies to collaborate to address common goals. Members may work at in different locations, in different organisations, or at different times so that the electronic communication media becomes an important feature in the feasibility of the work. Increasingly, technologies are used to support practitioners’ (leaders and teachers) professional learning. In this conceptual article, we draw on research literature from online and blended professional learning and development to conceptualise what is important to consider when establishing virtual teams for the purpose of practitioners’ learning. Specifically, we address the question: what are the characteristics of virtual teams that can serve the purpose of professional learning and development in schools? A technology-enriched planning model for institutions with an interest in establishing and maintaining a virtual team approach to PLD (VTPLD) is provided. We consider three strategic characteristics for PLD: (relevance, collaboration and a future focus) to address how virtual teams can support professional learning for teachers#FRE#
