#ITI#Implementing Dialogic Gatherings in TESOL teacher education#FTI#
#IRE#Purpose: This article reports the implementation of a series of Dialogic Gatherings (DGs), a course component in the education of pre-service secondary-education TESOL teachers in Spain. DGs are a successful educational action based on the reading and discussion of books and academic works, which leads to a dialogic construction of knowledge among participants. Design/methodology/approach: Our case study involved seven students, enrolled on a Master's Degree in Secondary Education, with a specialisation in teaching English. Information was gathered during 10 DG sessions and from initial and final reports and student notebooks, as well as from the trainer's observations. Findings: The findings suggested that DGs engaged participants in a critical understanding of the teaching-learning process of English as a Foreign Language, assisting their teacher identity construction process. In addition, the findings pointed both to the reading of scientific sources and to the dialogic methodology as key inputs for the promotion of critically responsive practices for Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). Originality/value: This exploratory study illustrates the relevance of providing future teachers with meaningful opportunities to reflect upon and to build critical knowledge through the dialogic reading of primary scientific sources as part of the TESOL process#FRE#
