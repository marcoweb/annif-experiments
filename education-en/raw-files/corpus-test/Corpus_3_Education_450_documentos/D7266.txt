#ITI#Learning leading - responsiveness in leading professional learning#FTI#
#IRE#Teachers’ professional learning is closely connected to and dependent on different leading practices. Teachers professional learning is regarded as a key factor in successful school development, and development leaders at different levels are assigned to provide for and support such learning. However, the connection between leading and learning needs to be further explored. In this article, we focus specifically on development leaders’ leading practice when leading professional learning. Based on the theory of practice architectures, the study explores the interplay between development leaders and teacher leaders in a professional development programme, where the leading and learning practices of the different leaders meet. The findings show that development leaders’ leading practice is characterised by responsiveness to ideas of successful leading, to experiences and observations of leading practices, to teacher leaders’ understanding and to their own leading practices. Through these types of responsiveness, a formative aspect of leading unfolds where the interplay between development leaders’ leading and teacher leaders’ learning practices appears. We refer to this as learning leading#FRE#
