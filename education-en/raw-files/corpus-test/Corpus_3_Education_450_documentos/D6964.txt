#ITI#A tool-kit to help students from low socioeconomic status background: a school-based self-regulated learning intervention#FTI#
#IRE#Socioeconomic status has been a long-time discussed topic due to its impact on children’s school paths. However, despite extant research indicating strong relationships between students’ socioeconomic status, use of self-regulated learning strategies, and academic achievement, research on interventions addressing these topics is limited. This investigation aimed to examine the effectiveness of a school-based, narrative-based program to promote self-regulated learning strategies and academic performance among fourth-graders from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Twelve classes were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds in each group were enrolled in the study. A quasi-experimental study with three measurement moments was conducted. Data were gathered from self-reported questionnaires and an on-task measure. Findings indicate that the program was efficacious in promoting the use of self-regulated learning strategies and academic performance in children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. This research paper discusses both practical implications and future research guidelines#FRE#
