#ITI#Learning digital literacies through experiential digital storytelling in an EAL context: an exploratory study#FTI#
#IRE#Teaching digital literacies as social practices is challenging for many English as an Additional Language (EAL) practitioners. There is not much research that offers effective approaches and specific examples. Drawing on the ‘3D’ model (Green [2002]. “A Literacy Project of Our Own.” English in Australia 134: 25–32), this exploratory study developed, implemented and evaluated a suitable pedagogic approach for teaching digital literacies–experiential digital storytelling. We examined its potential for EAL settings from the teacher-participant’s perspective using her reflective journal, her evaluation of student work, and an interview. The analysis suggests that using experiential digital storytelling enabled the teacher to extend most students’ learning beyond technical skills and develop their understanding of the complex relationships between language, technology, audience, context, social goals and power although some EAL students needed additional time and support. When designed with relevant theoretical constructs, experiential digital storytelling offers practitioners new possibilities to engage students in complex transliteracies practices in which meanings shift and change over time, space, relationships and resources. By conceptualising this new approach and providing a specific example of a learning unit, this study makes a conceptual and practical contribution to the field of language learning and teaching#FRE#
