#ITI#Professional development with universal design for learning: supporting teachers as learners to increase the implementation of UDL#FTI#
#IRE#Although the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Framework has been effective in designing tools and lessons, implementation of the Framework to design entire learning environments possesses its own limitations in research. This paper describes a quasi-experimental study of the effects of a professional development program on teachers’ implementation of the UDL framework. The study examines a weeklong Summer Institute as the professional development intervention. The Summer Institute meets many criteria shown to make PD effective: (a) content-focused training, (b) active learning, (c) modelling of effective practices, (e) feedback and reflection and (g) sustained duration. Participants included teachers across all academic levels and roles who attended the Institute (n = 73) and teachers who had not attended the Institute (n = 70). Teachers were evaluated by building administrators using an annual Teacher Success Rubric observation, a measuring tool developed to measure teachers’ efficacy in UDL implementation. Those attending the Institute increased their implementation of UDL in the classroom more than those who did not attend the Institute, F(1, 141) = 4.87, p =.03., suggesting that the Institute positively affects participants’ UDL implementation. The authors conclude that the Institute models effective professional development for other districts implementing the UDL Framework#FRE#
