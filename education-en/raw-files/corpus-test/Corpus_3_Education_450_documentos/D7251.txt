#ITI#Development and validation of a survey on outcomes of professional learning#FTI#
#IRE#Professional learning evaluators struggle to balance the pursuit of rigorous outcomes with the time and money that some effective measures entail. While many evaluations rely on surveys for their ease of administration and application, little research has explored how surveys can measure multiple constructs beyond participant satisfaction as part of an evaluation framework. This study validates a survey of professional learning outcomes based on Guskey’s framework of professional development evaluation. The 23-item survey was administered to 1,351 teachers in one district in the United States who receive professional learning interventions related to assessment use and assessment literacy. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, the study demonstrates the discriminatory validity of four constructs: knowledge gained from professional learning, skills used in the classroom, attitudes about professional learning, and beliefs about assessment. The study provides additional credence to the relevance of Guskey’s framework for evaluating professional learning interventions and insights regarding the utility of survey research in program evaluation activities#FRE#
