#ITI#Learning about translanguaging in two bilingual teacher preparation programs#FTI#
#IRE#In this article, our focus will be on two Hispanic Serving institutions (HSI’s) located on the US/Mexico Border and their bilingual teacher preparation faculty because they enroll a significant population of bilingual Latinx preservice teachers. We specifically ask What policies, ­practices and ideologies does bilingual teacher faculty use to prepare candidates for translanguaging pedagogies at HSIs? We will focus on how teacher educators are preparing future bilingual teachers to use translanguaging pedagogy in their classrooms. We argue that bilingual teacher educators can create safe spaces to support socially just pedagogies through translanguaging#FRE#
