#ITI#Multimodality and pronunciation in ICLHE (Integration of Content and Language in Higher Education) training#FTI#
#IRE#Purpose: This paper describes a study carried out within an ICLHE training programme in a Northern Italian university. The paper discusses the way an increased awareness of multimodal resources and the ability to deploy them effectively during lectures could offset language deficits of lecturers and enhance overall communicative competence and pedagogy. Design/methodology/approach: Eight mini-lectures given during a microteaching session undertaken as part of a training module were video recorded for analysis. Lectures are a form of multimodal discourse and multimodal analysis was chosen for an examination of spoken language with a particular focus on pronunciation, audiovisual presentations and non-verbal communication, as well as any other didactic material or strategies used by the participants. The video recordings were chosen on the basis of observations and feedback from the trainers with the aim of investigating ICLHE competence. Findings and originality: There have been few studies on pronunciation and ICLHE and they tend to be oriented towards investigating students’ pronunciation gains in English-medium Instruction (EMI). The findings of this study suggest that by enhancing multimodal competence and focusing on pronunciation, lecturers can improve their overall communicative competence. Value: The results of this study provide some indications of how educational developers can help lecturers increase their awareness of the communicative potential of multi-semiotic modes to support their pronunciation and improve the clarity of their lectures#FRE#
