#ITI#Mathematical problems in and out of school: The impact of considering mathematical operations and reality on real-life solutions#FTI#
#IRE#In this study, effects of asking participants to make different types of considerations when solving a realistic word problem were investigated. A two-factorial experiment with the factors “addressing realistic considerations” (with vs. without) and “addressing mathematical operations” (with vs. without) was conducted. It was assumed that reality-based considerations would lead to reality-based problem-solving strategies, thus fostering real-life solutions, while considering mathematical operations would lead to problem-solving strategies usually promoted in school, which were expected to impair realistic solutions. Analyses are based on N = 165 participants. The results showed that being asked to make reality-based considerations did not significantly affect realistic solutions (F(1, 161) = 2.43, p = 0.121, ηp2 = 0.015), while being asked to consider appropriate mathematical operations significantly impaired realistic solutions (F(1, 161) = 8.54, p = 0.004, ηp2 = 0.050). These findings suggest that inducing typical school problem-solving strategies may be detrimental when it comes to solving mathematical problems in a realistic way. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
