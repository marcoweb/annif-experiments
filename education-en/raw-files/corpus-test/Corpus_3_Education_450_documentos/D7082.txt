#ITI#Fostering affective engagement in Chinese language learning: A Bernsteinian account#FTI#
#IRE#Affective engagement, as one facet of the engagement model, takes on the role of activating other aspects to facilitate continued action in partaking in learning activities. Recognising the silences of Bernstein’s theoretical oeuvre on the affective aspect in the process of cultural transmission, this paper applies his concepts of classification (structure relations) and framing (interactional practices) to theorise current empirical work on students’ affective engagement in a primary school Chinese language learning (CLL) classroom located in a disadvantaged community in Australia. The data reported in this study were obtained from journal entries, focus groups and interviews with classroom teachers. The focus is on exploring the ways in which pedagogic practice can be used to foster certain ‘emotional regimes’ which can further the engagement of a diverse group of students in Chinese learning. The findings will expand understandings based on theories of affect and inform second language teachers to harness ‘technologies of affect’ in pedagogical spaces that work productively for disadvantaged students in the classroom#FRE#
