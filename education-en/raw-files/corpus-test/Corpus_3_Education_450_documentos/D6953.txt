#ITI#Learning across media in a second language#FTI#
#IRE#The present study investigated the impact of the medium on learning in L2. Specifically, learning performances from L2 material were compared across three media: text, video, and subtitled video. The participants were 126 undergraduate students who were randomly assigned across three conditions: a text condition, a video condition, and a subtitles condition. First, students were asked to complete three questionnaires on control variables. Second, students were asked to read/watch a learning material and answer comprehension, recall, transfer, and calibration questions twice: immediately and a week after. Results reveal that the participants in the video condition outperformed those in the text condition in delayed comprehension and recall. Overall, learning performances were substantially equivalent across media when assessed immediately after processing the material, but subtitled videos had the potential to boost deeper learning performances only in highly skilled learners#FRE#
