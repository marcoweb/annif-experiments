#ITI#Examining active help-seeking behavior in first-generation college students#FTI#
#IRE#First-generation (FG) college students (students for whom neither parent earned a bachelor’s degree) are typically less likely to interact with their instructors and communicate with them by email or in person, compared to continuing-generation (CG) students. Qualitative research suggests FG students are less likely to seek help when they need it, and when they do seek help they are more likely to engage in passive help-seeking (e.g., waiting quietly for assistance) as opposed to active help-seeking (e.g., promptly requesting assistance through multiple methods), compared to CG students. The current laboratory study provided students with an opportunity to seek academic and non-academic help and measured whether students engaged in active help-seeking behavior. We also tested whether having a shared identity with a help-provider could increase active help-seeking behavior among FG students. Results showed that FG students were less likely to seek academic help. Among FG and CG students who sought academic help, the intervention had no significant impact on active help-seeking. However, among students seeking non-academic help, active help-seeking behaviors were significantly higher for FG college students assigned a help-provider who signaled a FG identity. In other words, having a shared identity with a help-provider led to more active help-seeking among FG college students seeking non-academic assistance. FG faculty, staff, and student workers who provide non-academic assistance may want to consider self-identifying as FG to increase help-seeking behaviors among FG students struggling to navigate the college environment#FRE#
