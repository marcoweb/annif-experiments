#ITI#Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Practices in Higher Education: First Impressions of Preservice Teachers#FTI#
#IRE#In this study preservice teachers’ impressions on Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) practices in higher education were examined. This study was conducted by using case study method among qualitative research designs and with it 7 educators working in teachers college were given TPACK trainings and they were asked to perform practices in accordance with the trainings they received. Observations were made in the lessons of those who conducted TPACK-based lessons and feedback on the lessons was collected from a total of 158 preservice teachers. The data was analysed using content analysis. According to the results of the survey preservice teachers portrayed a positive attitude towards the lessons that were conducted in accordance with TPACK. TPACK practices attracted the attention of preservice teachers and they actively participated in the lessons thanks to these practices. Preservice teachers expressed that traditional teaching methods did not attract their attention anymore and that they wanted novelties which they themselves could use when they became teachers. According to the lesson observations and pre-service teachers’ views, it was decided that the structure of the TPACK was concentrated on the PK structure#FRE#
