#ITI#User Experience Matters: Does One size Fit all? Evaluation of Learning Management Systems#FTI#
#IRE#Learning Management Systems (LMS) are in use for years and are still crucial assets for both teachers and students for teaching and learning. There is a wide variety of LMS available for institutions to administer learning in and out of the classes. However, deciding to pick an LMS to integrate is a critical decision that affects both instructors and students. On the other hand, although there is previous research LMS from students' perspective, there is a lack of research in the literature from instructors' standpoint. This research aims to gain a deeper understanding of how in-service teachers, enrolled as students in the study program of instructional technology, use of LMS in terms of user experience and satisfaction of three well-known LMS, including Canvas, Blackboard, and Moodle. The results show a significant difference between the three LMS, Blackboard, Moodle, and Canvas, in terms of users’ subjective satisfaction, ease of use, and functionality#FRE#
