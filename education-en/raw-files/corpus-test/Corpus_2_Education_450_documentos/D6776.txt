#ITI#An E-safety Framework for Secondary Schools in Zimbabwe#FTI#
#IRE#Use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) offers extraordinary opportunities for society, particularly in the education sector. Many schools in Zimbabwe are now allowing the use of ICTs devices by learners in order to access the Internet and share educational material. However, there is considerable evidence that through use of ICTs, learners will be exposed to different ICTs risks. Learners using ICTs may face Internet and social media related risks which may expose them to inappropriate content, communicating and meeting strangers, cyberbullying, ICTs addiction and cyber-harassment. Sadly, most parents, teachers and learners do not have knowledge and expertise to mitigate these ICTs risks. As such, this research aims to develop an Electronic Safety (E-Safety) framework for Secondary Schools in Zimbabwe that teaches and safeguards learners from ICTs related risks. Researchers used a qualitative research method to gather information on the use of ICTs, risks faced by learners and how these risks can be mitigated. A case study of two secondary schools in Zvishavane District (Zimbabwe) was used. Data was collected using face-to-face interviews and questionnaires from learners. Data from teachers, parents and officials from Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, Child Protection Services and Ministry of Information Communication and Technology, Postal and Courier Services was collected using face to face interviews. Collected data was analysed using thematic analysis. A framework was then designed by researchers based on the results from the thematic analysis and reviewed by two experts#FRE#
