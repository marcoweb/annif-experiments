#ITI#Learning how to learn: Student voices on the function and utility of a student-engaged design intervention in a rural middle school#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of the present study was to explore the voices of high- and low-achieving middle school students around the function and utility of a student-engaged design learning how to learn intervention. The intervention was a year-long standard elective course in the curriculum in which all students enrolled during their time in middle school. Fifteen (N = 15) seventh- and eighth-grade students from a rural middle school participated in focus groups and provided information about their perceptions regarding the function and utility of this intervention. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data revealed that the intervention supported student motivation and self-regulatory skill development. In contrast to high-achieving students, low-achieving students expressed the need for additional support in setting and achieving their learning goals to maximize their experience of the intervention. Implications of these findings regarding future refinement and guidelines for implementation of student-engaged design interventions with respect to teacher training and practice in middle schools are discussed. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
