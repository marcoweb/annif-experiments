#ITI#Self-regulation matters: Examining the relationship between classroom learning environments and student motivation through structural equation modeling#FTI#
#IRE#The classroom learning environment plays a crucial role in promoting student motivation. With this in mind, this study investigates the relationship between classroom learning environments and student motivation via self-regulation as a mediator. We collected data from 2033 students and analyzed them using structural equation modeling. Task orientation, ongoing assessment, teacher support, cooperation, equity, involvement, and differentiated instruction in the classroom learning environment were found to be related to student motivation. Furthermore, our results suggest that self-regulation mediates the relationship between ongoing assessment, equity, teacher support, task orientation, cooperation, and student motivation. We discussed the implications of these findings for classroom orientation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
