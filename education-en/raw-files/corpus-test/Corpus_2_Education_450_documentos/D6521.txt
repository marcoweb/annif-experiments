#ITI#Gender equality perceptions of preservice teachers: are they ready to teach it?#FTI#
#IRE#Ensuring gender equality in education is among the Sustainable Development Goals specified by the United Nations. Ensuring gender equality in teaching/learning environments, however, requires gender aware and sensitive teachers. This study aimed to identify gender equality needs of preservice teachers through their perceptions. Following a qualitative research design, 16 (8 male/female) preservice teachers enrolled in a mid-size university in Turkey voluntarily participated in the study and were interviewed. The data were content analysed in the NVIVO software. The results showed that participants referred to gender differences as sex differences. Men were perceived as “helpers” in the household and role models for children while women were considered to have the main responsibility of looking after children. Female participants did not seem to be courageous enough to act against traditional gender stereotypes. Moreover, most participants supported the statement that girls are diligent but not clever enough and boys are clever but not diligent enough. It was surprising to observe participants’ agreement to the idea that men can be given priority in recruitment processes due to having the responsibility to provide for their families. Likewise, some participants perceived that women should first consult with their families before making a decision to start working. On the other hand, women’s family commitments and lack of leadership skills were reported as reasons preventing them from serving in administrative/political positions. Most importantly, females were perceived to be responsible for the violence committed against women. The implications are discussed in detail#FRE#
