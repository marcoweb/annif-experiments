#ITI#Immersive Extended Reality (XR) Technology in Engineering Education: Opportunities and Challenges#FTI#
#IRE#This article delves into the potential advantages and difficulties of using immersive Extended Reality (XR) technology in engineering education. It also examines the factors influencing the acceptance and intention to continue using XR in teaching practice from instructors’ viewpoints. The study has identified five themes that affect the use of XR in teaching practice: contextual factors, individual factors, social support, XR features, and attitudes. According to the research, professional development, technical support, and infrastructure are crucial contextual factors that positively influence the use of XR in teaching practice. Social support and XR features, such as interactivity, visualization, and simulation, also play a significant role. The article emphasizes on the need for addressing technical and infrastructure difficulties and providing adequate professional development and social support to facilitate the use of XR in engineering education. The findings of this study can assist policymakers and decision-makers in education and help educators and instructional designers effectively integrate XR into their teaching practices. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.#FRE#
