#ITI#Learning Number Conversions Through Embodied Interactions#FTI#
#IRE#In this paper, the researchers report an experimental study on conceptual knowledge learning and application through embodied interactions, expecting that bodily movements would facilitate learning in a positive manner. The intervention was enabled by Unity3D and Kinect V2, and taught novice adult learners the concepts of and conversions between binary and decimal numbers. Fifty-three adult participants were recruited, and randomly assigned into the experimental and control groups. During the intervention, participants in the experimental group manipulated and interacted with the learning materials through their body movements enabled by Kinect; while those in the control group learned the same content but interacted using conventional mouse and keyboard. Pre- and posttests results indicated that embodied interactions facilitated conceptual learning for the participating adult learners. However, compared with the mouse interaction, the embodied interactions did not lead to significantly better knowledge retention and application results. The study outcome implies that embodied interactions do not necessarily lead to better learning performances over traditional mouse-based interactions, and the ‘how’ and ‘how much’ may play critical roles for such interventions. Suggestions and challenges in designing learning systems utilizing embodied interactions enabled by novel technologies are provided#FRE#
