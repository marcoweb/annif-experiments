#ITI#A multilevel study of peer victimization and its associations with teacher support and well-functioning class climate#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of the current study was to examine whether students’ perceptions of teacher support at an individual-level, teacher support and well-functioning class climate at classroom-level, and teacher support and well-functioning class climate at school-level were associated with peer victimization. Data were obtained from a Student School Survey administered by the selected Swedish municipality. Multilevel analyses were based on 5,646 students in 277 classes and 27 schools. At the individual-level, girls and students who perceived greater teacher support than their classmates were victimized less often by their peers. In addition, students in schools with classes characterized by greater cooperation, cohesion, working atmosphere and respect toward their teachers tended to score lower on peer victimization. Within schools, students belonging to classes with a more well-functioning class climate than what was average in the school, and students belonging to classes that scored their teacher as more caring, fair and respectful compared to other classes in the school, were less likely to be targets of peer victimization#FRE#
