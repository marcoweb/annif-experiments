#ITI#Designing a Strategic Analysis and Planning Skills Training Board Game Using Mobile Technology and a Dual-Scaffolding Mechanism#FTI#
#IRE#Strategic planning is a key competency for business management education. This study designed a dual scaffold-oriented strategy planning board game based on cognitive scaffolding and peer scaffolding and combined it with a real-time checking mechanism using mobile technology. The 68 university students were divided into an experimental group for scaffold game-based learning and a control group for case-based discussion learning to investigate the differences in learning effectiveness, flow and learning anxiety, and to explore the technology acceptance, scaffold usefulness, and activity anxiety of the game-based learning group. The results revealed that the learning effectiveness of the experimental group was significantly improved, while there was no significant difference in the control group; the overall flow and technology acceptance of the experimental group were both relatively high; learning anxiety was significantly reduced in both groups, and the experimental group did not have excessive activity anxiety. There were no significant differences in learning anxiety of the two groups. As for scaffolding usefulness evaluation, the proportion of using peer scaffolding was the highest, and the learners thought that using peer scaffolding was helpful for developing their strategic planning skills. It is suggested that the design of the game mechanism in the future can encourage learners to use the cognitive scaffolding and the mobile-based metacognitive scaffolding more often, and the quality of peer discussions may be improved through the real-time evaluation of the metacognitive scaffolding. © De La Salle University 2023.#FRE#
