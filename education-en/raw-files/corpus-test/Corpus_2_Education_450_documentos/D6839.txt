#ITI#Improving the Learning of Mechanics Through Augmented Reality#FTI#
#IRE#This study investigates to which extent students’ understanding of the physical phenomenon of torque can be improved through the use of visualization technology, in particular of augmented reality (AR). The students in the first-year course Mechanics I at KTH participated in the study by taking two tests on torque. In between those tests, a subgroup of students participated in a user study where they used an AR application to solve problems regarding torque. The results of the pre-test and the post-test indicate that the subgroup who used the app improved their understanding of torque to a greater extent than the ones who did not use the app. However, a larger sample space would be required to obtain a complete statistical characterization of the reported (qualitative and quantitative) improvement#FRE#
