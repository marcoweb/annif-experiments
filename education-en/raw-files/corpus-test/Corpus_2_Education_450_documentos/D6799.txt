#ITI#Blended Learning Acceptance: A Systematic Review of Information Systems Models#FTI#
#IRE#Examining the blended learning (b-learning) acceptance is not a new research topic, and it has been tackled by many scholars. Nevertheless, the analysis of information systems (IS) models that are used to study the acceptance of b-learning is regarded as a topic of great importance. To examine these models and afford scholars a holistic view of this research trend, we should be aware of the forefront IS models adopted in this research trend. To that end, the current systematic review analyzed a total of 64 studies published between 2006 and 2018. The key research findings revealed that the technology acceptance model (TAM) was regarded as the predominant model in predicting the individuals’ intention to adopt b-learning. Additionally, e-learning was found to be the most effective tool used to manage b-learning classrooms. Besides, investigating the students’ adoption or acceptance of b-learning along with its underpinned technologies represents the main research purpose addressed among the majority of the analyzed studies. Furthermore, most of the collected studies were conducted in Malaysia, Taiwan, and Turkey, respectively. Moreover, university students were found to be the main respondents in terms of data collection in most of the analyzed studies. These results are expected to immensely provide a better understanding of b-learning research on one hand, and the use of IS models on the other hand#FRE#
