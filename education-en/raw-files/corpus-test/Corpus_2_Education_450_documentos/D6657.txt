#ITI#Action research to explore argumentative writing projects supported with online simulation for developing conceptual knowledge and motivation to learn#FTI#
#IRE#Non-science majors often lack motivation to take science courses required for their graduation, because these courses are usually taught in a lecture format and are disconnected from their everyday life and needs related to future careers. This two-phase action research, utilizing argumentative writing (AW) supported with online simulation, was conducted over three academic years in a college chemistry course designed for non-science majors. Phase 1, a quasi-experimental design (n = 134), examined the treatment effects of AW projects and determined the components of AW that contributed to student gains in conceptual performance. The results showed that students in the AW group scored significantly higher in conceptual performance than the control group. Five AW components predicted student gains in conceptual performance: accuracy of claim, relationship between claim and question, relationship between claim and evidence, use of multiple examples, and use of appropriate writing style. Phase 2, a single group design (n = 118), explored the inter-relationships between pre-/post-course knowledge, pre-/post-course motivation, and students’ performance on AW projects. The results showed that students’ motivation to learn chemistry at the beginning of the course is a significant predictor of their conceptual performance. Pathway analysis found that the performance of AW projects in low motivation students was affected by extrinsic motivation (grades, career). Their performance in AW projects did not affect their post-course knowledge. In contrast, the performance in AW projects by high motivation students was affected by intrinsic motivation and self-determination. They cumulatively built knowledge through AW projects that eventually affected post-course knowledge#FRE#
