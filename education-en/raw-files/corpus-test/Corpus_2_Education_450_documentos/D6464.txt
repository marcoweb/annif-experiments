#ITI#A Student Engagement Typology and Its Relationship to Ability Development in Chinese Universities#FTI#
#IRE#This study explored student engagement typology in Chinese universities and examined variations in the ability development across student types. Using data generated by a survey study covering 8461 undergraduate students at 53 Chinese universities, this research applied latent profile analysis to construct a Chinese student engagement typology. We divide students into three types: actively engaged students, passively engaged students, and insufficiently engaged students. We then examined the relationships between student engagement types and cognitive and non-cognitive abilities and explored the differences in these relationships across educational contexts. We found that actively engaged students developed competencies best and that the effects of student engagement types on ability development varied by institution types and subject areas#FRE#
