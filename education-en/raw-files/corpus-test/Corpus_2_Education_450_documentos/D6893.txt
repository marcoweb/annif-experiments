#ITI#Virtual Reality, Medical Spanish, and the L2 Motivational Self System: A Case Study#FTI#
#IRE#The field of language learning and technology is an ever-growing field as new technologies are constantly developed, and it is important to understand the impact these new technologies may have on language learning. The purpose of this work-in-progress study was to investigate the effects of virtual reality (VR) simulations on a specific second language (L2) theory of motivation—the L2 Motivational Self System (L2MSS). VR simulations were implemented in an intermediate level course on medical Spanish, and this study follows the cases of six participants who completed a pre- and posttest consisting of questions about the Ideal L2 Self, the Ought-to L2 Self, and the L2 Learning Experience. Participants completed 12 VR simulations and wrote a journal entry about their experience. Results showed a significant increase in the Ideal L2 Self, a significant decrease in the Ought-to L2 Self, and no significant change in the L2 Learning Experience. Participants highlighted the visualization component of the L2MSS and the connection to their future ideal professional selves in their journal entries. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.#FRE#
