#ITI#Academic buoyancy among female secondary school students: An examination of predictors and outcomes up to age 22#FTI#
#IRE#We investigated academic buoyancy—and its predictors and outcomes—among female students attending all-girls and coeducational schools. We examined data from 1,254 female students. Structural equation modeling revealed that students’ perceptions of three instructional climate factors (teacher-student relationships, useful content, engaging content) were positively associated with their learning strategies (elaboration, memorization, control) and achievement and, in turn, academic buoyancy (assessed one year later) in similar ways across the two school types. In turn, learning strategies, achievement, and academic buoyancy were associated with academic, well-being, and occupational outcomes assessed up to age 22 in different ways. Together, the findings provide understanding about academic buoyancy among girls, provide guidance for how teachers can support buoyancy and other personal attributes among girls, and yield knowledge about the longer-term outcomes of academic buoyancy. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
