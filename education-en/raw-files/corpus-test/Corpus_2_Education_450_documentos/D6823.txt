#ITI#Learning from anywhere, anytime: Utilitarian motivations and facilitating conditions for mobile learning#FTI#
#IRE#This contribution investigates higher education students’ perceptions about mobile learning (m-learning) applications, as well as the effects of social influences and of appropriate facilitating conditions, on their intentions to continue using them. A structured survey questionnaire integrated valid measures from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to better explain their acceptance and use of m-learning software. The findings reported that facilitating conditions including the provision of resources, ongoing training opportunities and technical support, were affecting the respondents’ engagement with m-learning programs. The respondents indicated that they were not influenced by others to use mobile technologies for educational purposes. The results also suggest that they were well acquainted (and habituated) with the use of mobile devices and their applications. Evidently, they helped them improve their learning journeys#FRE#
