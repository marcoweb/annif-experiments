#ITI#Print referencing during e-storybook reading on a SMART board for kindergartners to promote early literacy skills#FTI#
#IRE#This study examined the effects of a classroom-focused intervention on different domains of early literacy. The intervention consisted of shared e-book reading combined with a print referencing technique done via a SMART board. The specific goal of the study was to examine whether children could be instructed simultaneously in print knowledge, phonological awareness, and vocabulary, without a loss of impact on the development of either skill. Results revealed significantly larger gains with high effect sizes in print knowledge (ηp2 =.474) and phonological awareness (ηp2 =.370) when children received the print referencing e-book intervention compared to the control conditions. Print referencing did not hinder children’s learning of new words, but enhanced vocabulary to the same extent, or even higher, as e-books typically do in kindergarten when print referencing is not involved. The findings indicate that e-book reading merged with print referencing is a beneficial method for enhancing essential early literacy skills simultaneously. The learning tool is particularly efficient for a tailor-made educational setting, as it allows differential attention to students and lessens the workload for teachers#FRE#
