#ITI#Usability Evaluation of Imikode Virtual Reality Game to Facilitate Learning of Object-Oriented Programming#FTI#
#IRE#Many empirical studies have shown that educational games and recent technologies impact education and increase learning effectiveness, students’ motivation and engagement. The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the usability of Imikode, a virtual reality (VR) game that was developed to introduce the concepts of object-oriented programming to novices. The improved version of the Imikode VR game consists of three features: An artificial intelligence component designed to provide real-time error feedback to users, an intelligent agent that guides and teaches users how to play the game and finally, the integration of multiple game play that gives learners more opportunities to explore the VR environment for greater immersive learning experience. This study adopted a survey approach and recruited first-year computer science students to measure learner satisfaction with educational virtual reality games and examined the correlations among the attributes of the Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of Use questionnaire of usage of Imikode. The results showed that the students were satisfied with Imikode and perceived the virtual reality educational game as very useful for learning object-oriented programming concepts. In addition, there was a correlation among the questionnaire variables, which means that researchers can use the instrument for future usability studies in the context. We further proffered some design recommendations for building software tools#FRE#
