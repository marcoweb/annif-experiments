#ITI#Validity and Reliability of Cognitive Constructivism-Oriented Teaching Conception Questionnaire#FTI#
#IRE#Background: As there is a paucity of instrument investigating a hybrid teaching conception, the current study is seen as part of attempt to fill this gap. Methodology: The subjects in the study were 310 University participants–instructors in Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (Vietnam). The survey was implemented with the use of Cognitive Constructivism-oriented Teaching Conception Questionnaire (CCOTCQ), including two scales, namely, teachers’ beliefs and teachers’ intentions of actual practice. Each is inclusive of three factors: Teaching, Teacher, and Students. Results: Exploratory factor analysis was applied to the data and identified three dimensions. The confirmatory factor analysis model was good for both scale of teachers’ beliefs and that of their intention of actual practice. The Pearson correlation analysis found a significant relationship in the results for the scale of teachers’ beliefs and that of their intentions of actual practice#FRE#
