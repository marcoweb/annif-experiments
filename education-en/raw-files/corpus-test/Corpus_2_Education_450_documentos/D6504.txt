#ITI#A review of growth mindset intervention in higher education: the case for infographics in cultivating mindset behaviors#FTI#
#IRE#To explore effective growth mindset intervention that is applicable for the higher education setting, study 1 conducted a systematic review to analyze relevant literature published between 2010 and 2021. We identified 13 papers and synthesized the results of these studies to understand how the intervention was designed, conducted, and evaluated, pointing out the lack of attention to visual images as mindset intervention in the existing literature. Accordingly, in study 2, a set of infographic materials was developed and delivered to thirty participants recruited in a university to cultivate a growth mindset. The participants were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. To measure the effectiveness of the intervention, participants are required to complete a pre-and post-survey. Significant differences were found between the two groups after 6-week intervention, as the experimental group perceived intelligence significantly more malleable. Weekly reflections were analyzed to evaluate the impacts of the designed materials#FRE#
