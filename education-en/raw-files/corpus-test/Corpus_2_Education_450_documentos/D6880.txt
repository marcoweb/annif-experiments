#ITI#Video-Based Virtual Reality Technology for Autistic Users: An Emerging Technology Report#FTI#
#IRE#Research suggests that virtual reality (VR) technologies can promote learning opportunities for individuals with autism in safe and controllable training scenarios. However, substantial challenges exist concerning the development and deployment of fully immersive VR systems in real-world settings. Video-based virtual reality is an emerging technology that maintains many of the same potential learning benefits to traditional VR systems while being easier to develop and deploy. This emerging technology report explores the use and potential of video-based virtual reality to support autistic users within naturalistic settings. Current trends in the field are reported, along with a focus on the application of evidence-based practices that align with this learner population. Finally, challenges with adoption and implementation are considered in addition to implications for future research#FRE#
