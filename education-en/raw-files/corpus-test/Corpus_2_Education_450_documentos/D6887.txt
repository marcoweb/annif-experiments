#ITI#A Systematic Review of Virtual Reality Features for Skill Training#FTI#
#IRE#The evolving complexity of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies necessitates an in-depth investigation of the VR features and their specific utility. Although VR is utilized across various skill-training applications, its successful deployment depends on both technical maturity and context-specific suitability. A comprehensive understanding of advanced VR features, both technical and experiential, their prospective impact on designated learning outcomes, and the application of appropriate assessment methodologies is essential for the effective utilization of VR technologies. This systematic literature review explored the inherent associations between various VR features employed in professional training environments and their impact on learning outcomes. Furthermore, this review scrutinizes the assessment techniques employed to gauge the effects of VR applications in various learning scenarios. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method was used to systematically select 50 empirical VR studies sourced from three (03) academic databases. The analysis of these articles revealed complex, context-dependent relationships between VR features and their impact on professional training, with a pronounced emphasis on skill-based learning outcomes over cognitive and affective ones. This review also highlights the predominantly subjective nature of the assessment methods used to measure the effects of VR training. Additionally, the findings call for further empirical exploration in novel skill training contexts encompassing cognitive and affective learning outcomes, as well as other potential external factors that may influence learning outcomes in VR. © The Author(s) 2024.#FRE#
