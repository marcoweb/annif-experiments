#ITI#A meta-analysis on the cognitive and linguistic correlates of reading skills among children with ASD#FTI#
#IRE#This meta-analysis aimed to systematically investigate the cognitive and linguistic correlates of both word decoding and reading comprehension among children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) across orthographies. Based on data from 26 studies of 1.92- to 18.92-year-old children with ASD, we found that (1) intelligence, theory of mind, and executive function exhibited modest associations (rs =.41,.46, and.39, respectively) with reading; (2) phonological awareness, semantic skills, and syntax skills also showed modest associations (rs =.53,.50, and.53, respectively) with reading; (3) cognitive and linguistic skills showed comparable contributions to word decoding and reading comprehension, when both skills were analyzed in the same model with meta-analytic structural equation modeling; (4) age, language type, publication type, sample type, and reading measures did not moderate the relations. Taken together, these findings suggested that although children with ASD exhibit language weaknesses, their linguistic skills still made important contributions to reading development beyond cognitive skills. Further, cognitive skills may compensate for language deficits in children with ASD’s reading development. Implications for reading interventions in children with ASD were also discussed#FRE#
