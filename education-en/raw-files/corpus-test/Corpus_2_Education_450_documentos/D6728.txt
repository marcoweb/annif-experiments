#ITI#A quick briefing on the new version of Eye and Pen (version 3.01): news and update#FTI#
#IRE#To explore the dynamics of processing in manuscript production, it is necessary to possess a system for recording the writer's graphic activity. This work describes the new version of the Eye and Pen program (version 3.01). In addition to the fact that it is now freely available (https://www.eyeandpen.net), the improvements described focus on its use for handwritten word production. First, we give some examples of the new features and improvements included in this new version, e.g., compatibility with previous versions and with other writing dynamics acquisition programs; “in-air” measurements; the choice of driver for timestamping; signal processing tools. The second part is dedicated to the issue of synchronization and temporal precision for the display of stimuli. The material presented here is available on OSF (http://osf.io/afpvz; project Eye and Pen). © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2022.#FRE#
