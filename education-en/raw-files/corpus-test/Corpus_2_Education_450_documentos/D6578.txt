#ITI#How do growth mindsets contribute to academic engagement in L2 classes? The mediating and moderating roles of the L2 motivational self system#FTI#
#IRE#Language mindsets and second language motivational self system (L2MSS) are two important motivational frameworks in understanding second language (L2) engagement. We argue that whether and how mindsets predict academic engagement can be explained by L2MSS components (ideal L2 self, ought-to L2 self, and learning experience). Using a multi-stage cluster sampling method, we collected survey data from 384 English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) learners in Iran. Results of structural equation modelling showed that growth mindsets predicted academic engagement via ideal L2 self, but not via ought-to L2 self. Moreover, the association between mindsets and academic engagement was moderated by learning experience. Mindsets positively predicted engagement only for learners who had more favourable learning experiences. We discussed theoretical implications for integrating L2MSS and mindsets theories to better understand learners’ engagement, and highlighted that promoting growth mindsets should be combined with positive learning experiences#FRE#
