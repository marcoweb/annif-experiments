#ITI#Stressors and vulnerability during upper secondary school: subjective experiences of classroom climate and coping beliefs as predicting factors of school stress in Norway#FTI#
#IRE#The present longitudinal study was designed to scrutinize how adolescents perceive their life in upper secondary schools in general, and how central aspects of their perceived classroom climate predicted their coping beliefs and experience of school stress in particular. The participants were 1215 students in upper secondary schools (grades 2 and 3) from one county in Norway. The data were analysed by means of structural equation modelling, and the findings reveal gender differences that need further investigation in future research. Our study indicates that a performance-oriented goal structure and social support from peers and teachers seem to be a potential risk factor and/or protective factor when it comes to adolescents’ development of coping beliefs and experiences of school stress, especially among girls#FRE#
