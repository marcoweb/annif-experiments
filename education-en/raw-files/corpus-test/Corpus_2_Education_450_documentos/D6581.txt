#ITI#Self-advocacy experiences of students with specific learning disabilities#FTI#
#IRE#Discussions about students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) often center on finding solutions for the difficulties they face in school. However, there is a lack of emphasis on the self-advocacy experiences of these students. Self-advocacy can empower students with SLD to pursue their interests, understand their rights, and effectively address any violations of those rights. Drawing on self-advocacy, which encompasses four domains (knowledge of self, knowledge of rights, communication, and leadership), this study explores the self-advocacy experiences of students with SLD enrolled in vocational high schools in Istanbul, Turkey. Twelve students (50.0% females; Mage = 15.91 years; SD = 1.08; range = 14–18 years) participated in semi-structured interviews. The findings revealed that: (i) the students had limited knowledge of their SLD conditions, characteristics, and rights, despite having some self-awareness; (ii) they emphasized the difficulties and negative aspects when describing themselves and their school experiences; (iii) they were able to communicate their needs and preferences to school staff, but they were not frequently understood or responded to; and (iv) they rarely demonstrated leadership behaviors when advocating for others. These findings suggest that students with SLD may lack self-advocacy skills and are not effectively advocating for themselves and others in vocational high schools in Turkey#FRE#
