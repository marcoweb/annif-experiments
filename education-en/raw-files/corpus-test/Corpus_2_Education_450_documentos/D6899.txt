#ITI#Open Innovation in Schools: A New Imperative for Organising Innovation in Education?#FTI#
#IRE#Schools are considered knowledge-creating organisations that find it difficult to develop and implement innovations on their own. Knowledge mobilisation is seen as the key to overcoming this problem. In particular, the use of external sources of knowledge is regarded as an important lever for change. However, there is a lack of concepts and empirical studies in educational research on the extent to which external knowledge is used for innovation in schools. Based on a sample of N = 411 schools, this article explores whether the concept of open innovation can be used in the context of education. Originating from the field of innovation research, open innovation regimes are seen as imperative if organisations are to create and benefit from technology. Multinomial logistic regression analyses show that mobilising external knowledge significantly increases the likelihood of implementing innovations in schools. A machine-learning approach reveals that it is necessary to tailor open innovation regimes to the specific conditions of any given school. In particular, with regard to the use of new technologies and innovations in the field of digitalisation, open innovation can be a lever for change. © The Author(s) 2023.#FRE#
