#ITI#Identifying core features and barriers in the actualization of growth mindset pedagogy in classrooms#FTI#
#IRE#Research identifying the core features of Growth Mindset Pedagogy (GMP) in Chinese mathematics education is limited. This is also the first time we have examined the barriers to implementing GMP. We used semi-structured interviews to collect data. By analyzing the interview data, we identified four core features of GMP in mathematics classrooms: differentiation as the foundation of pedagogical practice, no stereotypes about mathematics learning, encouraging students to think in a process-oriented manner, and promoting a persistent learning attitude. We also found five barriers to GMP implementation: (a) lack of professional support; (b) lack of time; (c) student differences and class size; (d) ignoring cultural contextual elements; and (e) poor partnership between parents and teachers. In our discussion section, we outlined the implications of these findings for research and practice in educational contexts#FRE#
