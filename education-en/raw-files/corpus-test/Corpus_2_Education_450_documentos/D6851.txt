#ITI#Examining the Emotional Semantic Orientation of Gifted Students Towards the Flipped Learning Model#FTI#
#IRE#The aim of this study was to examine the emotional semantic orientation of gifted students towards the flipped learning model (FLM). An explanatory sequential design, one of the mixed research methods, was utilized in this research. Participants were 53 gifted students, who continued their education in a Science and Art Center in the Eastern Anatolia Region, in the first semester of the 2019–2020 academic year. Participants stated the FLM to be fun, different, instructive, useful, advantageous, and flexible in terms of in-class practices. They also found the FLM to be fun owing to its features such as facilitating learning, being flexible, and providing opportunities for practice. Moreover, the participants regarded the FLM as fun, useful, advantageous, flexible, and effective in terms of out-of-class practices. Another result was that no significant difference was found between the emotional semantic orientations of the female and male gifted students in terms of in-class practices. However, in terms of out-of-class practices, there was a significant difference between the scores obtained from the answers given for the effective-ineffective adjective pair in favor of male participants, while there a significant difference between the scores obtained from the answers given for the fun-boring adjective pair in favor of female participants. Investigation of integrating hybrid learning approaches such as the FLM and evaluating students’ cognitive and affective developments in other disciplines and subjects should be conducted to obtain more data on this approach#FRE#
