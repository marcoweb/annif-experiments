#ITI#The homophily and centrality of LGBQ youth: A new story?#FTI#
#IRE#The social acceptance of LGBQ individuals changed dramatically over the past several decades, which calls into question extant research suggesting that LGBQ youth are often socially excluded. The current study utilizes quantitative social network analysis techniques to examine the peer group homophily and social centrality of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Questioning (LGBQ) students in two junior high schools. Results suggest that LGBQ students were more likely to be in peer groups with at least one other LGBQ individual. LGBQ students’ centrality was the same as heterosexual students within their peer group as well as their peer group’s perceived popularity across the whole school. These results suggest that LGBQ students today may not experience the same social exclusion as past generations#FRE#
