#ITI#Adjustment and acceptance beliefs in achievement settings: Implications for student wellbeing#FTI#
#IRE#Research suggests that when dealing with personal setbacks, secondary control (SC) adjustment and acceptance beliefs can foster psychological wellbeing. However, little research has examined these beliefs, in combination, and how they impact students in their academic development. We conducted secondary analysis using an eight-month longitudinal study design over a two-semester introductory course on a sample of university students (n = 237; 64% female; Mage = 19 years old). Multiple regression analyses assessed whether the students’ Semester 1 adjustment and acceptance SC beliefs influenced Semester 2 learning-related emotions, perceived stress, and perceived course success, and whether Adjustment x Acceptance interactions emerged involving these outcomes. Adjustment beliefs promoted learning-related positive emotions (hope, pride), perceived course success, and reduced perceived stress; acceptance predicted higher shame and perceived stress. Students’ adjustment predicted lower helplessness for students with high acceptance beliefs. These findings are discussed in light of the role that SC beliefs might play in curbing psychological distress reported by students on postsecondary campuses#FRE#
