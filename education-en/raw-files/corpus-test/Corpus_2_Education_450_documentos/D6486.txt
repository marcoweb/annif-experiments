#ITI#Do adolescents want death to be included in their education?#FTI#
#IRE#This study sets out to ascertain adolescents’ attitudes and opinions towards death education. To this end two instruments were designed and validated: the ‘Death Education Attitudes Scale-Students’ and the ‘Death Education Questionnaire-Students’. The total sample comprised 1897 secondary school students aged 12–19. Participants showed moderately positive attitudes towards death education. Variables such as gender, age and religious beliefs influenced results. Death is not unfamiliar to adolescents; on the contrary, it affects them through the loss of loved ones, and they saw themselves as capable of reflecting on it. The study has implications for the training of teachers and families and for the inclusion of the awareness of death in curricula and in educational policies on national and international levels#FRE#
