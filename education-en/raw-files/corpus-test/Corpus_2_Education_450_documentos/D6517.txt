#ITI#Which STEM relationships promote science identities, attitudes, and social belonging? A longitudinal investigation with high school students from underrepresented groups#FTI#
#IRE#A longitudinal science intervention with students from ethnic-racial underrepresented groups in an urban area examined the roles of intervention participation and STEM relationships in implicit and explicit science identity and attitudes and social belonging. Across a four-week geoscience program, Black, Latinx, and Native American/Alaskan Native (87.5%) students (N = 97; Mage = 15.27; female = 44%) from low socio-economic backgrounds engaged in hands-on activities, field trips, group projects, and listened to diverse speakers. During the intervention, students had the opportunity to form relationships with teachers and near-peer mentors (undergraduate STEM students). Participants exhibited increases in positive explicit and implicit science attitudes, identity, and social belonging. Also, psychosocial support from teachers and near-peer mentors developed over time, but near-peer mentorship uniquely explained changes in science identity and social belonging. Positive changes in implicit and explicit attitudes and explicit science identity were further qualified by past academic performance—only low, compared to high, achieving students benefited the most from the intervention. The present intervention provides evidence that immersing ethnic-racial minority high school students in an engaging science program with supportive STEM relationships promotes science-based cognitions that have implications for persistence in STEM#FRE#
