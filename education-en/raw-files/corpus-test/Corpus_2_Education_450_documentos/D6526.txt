#ITI#University STEM instructors with stronger failure-as-debilitating mindsets are perceived to engage in fewer mastery-oriented teaching Practices by their students: An exploratory study#FTI#
#IRE#The present study builds on and adds to a growing body of literature suggesting that teachers’ mindsets predict students’ classroom experiences. We examine to what extent university STEM instructors’ beliefs about the role of failure in students’ learning (i.e., their failure-as-debilitating mindsets) are associated with their engagement in mastery-oriented teaching practices (as reported by students) as well as their students’ overall perceptions of their courses. After surveying 238 university STEM instructors’ failure-as-debilitating mindsets and collecting course evaluation data from institutional records, we found that instructors with stronger failure-as-debilitating mindsets were reported to engage in fewer mastery-oriented teaching practices (i.e., being available to students, encouraging student questions, and providing opportunities for active learning). Students also reported that they learned less in these instructors’ courses and rated the instructor and course more negatively. Importantly, these associations were found even after controlling for several instructor- and course-relevant covariates that are typically associated with students’ course evaluations, as well as instructors’ mindsets about intelligence. Findings suggest that instructor mindsets about failure are visible to students and should be explored as a potential point of intervention in future research#FRE#
