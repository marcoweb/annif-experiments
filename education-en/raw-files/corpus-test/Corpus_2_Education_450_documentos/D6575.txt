#ITI#Perceived teacher procedural justice and aggressive behaviors among Chinese primary students: The mediating roles of negative evaluation of school rules and malicious envy#FTI#
#IRE#Although previous studies have shown the association between students’ perceived teacher procedural justice and their aggressive behaviors, there are still mediating mechanisms that need to be explored to fully understand the relationship. This study proposed a parallel mediation model through both legitimacy of authority and through motivation to decrease the advantage of others. A total of 402 fifth and sixth graders (10–12 years of age) from three public primary schools in central China participated in this study. They completed the self-report measures of perceived procedural teacher justice, negative evaluation of school rules, malicious and benign envy, aggressive behaviors, and personal belief in a just world. The results showed that students’ perceived teacher procedural justice negatively predicted their aggression, and this relationship was mediated by both negative evaluation of school rules and malicious envy in a parallel mediation model after controlling for students’ gender and personal belief in a just world. In conclusion, perceiving teachers’ behaviors as procedurally just, students are less likely to have a negative attitude toward school rules and feel malicious envy, and thus are less likely to engage in aggressive behaviors. The findings help understand the psychological processes underlying the relationship between perceived teacher procedural justice and aggression and have practical implications for justice-related daily teaching practices and school-based interventions for reducing aggression#FRE#
