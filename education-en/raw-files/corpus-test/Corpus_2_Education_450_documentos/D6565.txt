#ITI#The causalities between learning burnout and internet addiction risk: A moderated-mediation model#FTI#
#IRE#This study explored how self-control and eudaimonic orientation are associated with learning burnout and internet addiction risk (IAR). Our results demonstrate that learning burnout has a significant and positive impact on IAR. The impulse system and control system play parallel mediating roles in the relationship between learning burnout and IAR. The relationship between learning burnout and IAR is moderated by eudaimonic orientation. Finally, the mediating role of the impulse system on learning burnout and IAR is moderated by eudaimonic orientation. With these findings, our study clarifies the mediating roles of the impulse system and control system in learning burnout and IAR and the moderating effects of hedonic orientation and eudaimonic orientation. Our study not only offers a new perspective for IAR research but also has practical implications for intervening in middle school students’ IAR#FRE#
