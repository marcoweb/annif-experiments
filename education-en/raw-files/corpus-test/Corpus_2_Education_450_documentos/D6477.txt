#ITI#What Motivates Korean Language Learners to Learn? Motivational Characteristics and their Relationships with Learning Engagement#FTI#
#IRE#Taking the L2 Motivational Self System (L2MSS) model as its theoretical basis, this study aimed to extend knowledge of the learning motivation of Korean language learners. A survey questionnaire was administered to 967 Korean language learners at 28 universities in China to investigate their motivation for learning the Korean language and the relationship between their learning motivation and their learning engagement. The results showed high levels of the ideal L2 self and the L2 learning experience and low levels of the ought-to L2 self. Additionally, the L2MSS had a high explanatory power for engagement. The ideal L2 self and the L2 learning experience were positively associated with the learning engagement of the participating Korean language learners. These results enhance understanding of Korean language learners’ learning motivation and may offer guidance for improving their learning engagement. © De La Salle University 2023.#FRE#
