#ITI#Developing a Framework for Mobile Learning Adoption and Sustainable Development#FTI#
#IRE#Learning innovation for future education often includes digital approaches to enhance learning and to contribute to the development of twenty-first-century skills. There is evidence that mobile learning provides positive outcomes. However, there is a recognized lack of research in the field of frameworks and models that contributes to highlighting mobile learning rewards. This study aims to investigate the main characteristics of a strategic framework for the adaption and sustainable use of mobile learning. This study is based on a systematic review of 15 investigations published between 2009 and 2018. An adaptation of the strategic management framework by Jauch and Glueck (Business policy and strategic management, McGraw-Hill, London, 1988) was developed to show the results. The framework has a pedagogical foundation. Leaders, teachers, learners, families, and community members are identified as the key pillars upholding and maximizing mobile learning. The proposed framework is envisaged to serve as a guide for the educational community in implementing sustainable mobile learning#FRE#
