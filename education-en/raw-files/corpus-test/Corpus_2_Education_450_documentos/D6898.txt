#ITI#Using Podcasting to Engage Online and Distance Learning Students: A Pilot Study#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this pilot study is to learn whether and to what extent, the introduction of podcasts and podcasting into teacher education classes improves the educational experience for preservice teachers. A survey and individual interviews were analyzed through the lens of Garrison et al.’s (2000) model of community inquiry, which involves three elements essential to educational experiences in online environments: cognitive presence, social presence, and teaching presence. Among the key findings was that aligning instructional purpose with student podcasting had the greatest influence on student engagement. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.#FRE#
