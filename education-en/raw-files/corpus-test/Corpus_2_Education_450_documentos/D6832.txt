#ITI#Interactive Artifacts and Stories: Design Considerations for an Object-Based Learning History Game#FTI#
#IRE#Object-based learning includes the active incorporation of historic artifacts into educational environments, which may yield meaningful learning experiences. However, gaining access to artifacts and coordinating object-based curricula with museum staff pose immense challenges to educators. Furthermore, digital representations of historic artifacts are often removed from authentic, culturally-situated surroundings. By providing a system-level overview of a game currently under development titled Kresy, this emerging technology report explains how video game affordances, particularly interactive narrative, may support object-based learning in digital environments. To support object-based learning and engagement with 20th-century Eastern European history, Kresy weaves story through evidence collection and inquiry mechanics. In presenting these design considerations, this report shows the viability of merging game- and object-based learning within an immersive virtual environment#FRE#
