#ITI#In what conditions are intercultural practices implemented in disadvantaged and diverse settings in Portugal? Associations with professional and organization-related variables#FTI#
#IRE#Although intercultural practices are believed to be extremely relevant to combat educational disadvantages, evidence on the factors that are related to their implementation is not yet well established. This study aims to deepen the understanding regarding the implementation of intercultural practices by professionals working in disadvantaged and culturally diverse contexts, examining its association with the institution’s socioeconomic and cultural diversity, organizational climate and professionals’ self-efficacy and job satisfaction. Participants were 78 professionals (95.3% female, with an age average of 42.52), working in disadvantaged and culturally diverse educational settings in Portugal. Self-efficacy was positively associated with the use of intercultural practices, while higher concentration of Roma and lower education/low-income children were negatively associated with the implementation of intercultural practices, self-efficacy and job satisfaction. A supportive organizational climate was positively associated with professionals’ sense of efficacy and job satisfaction. Findings highlight the importance of promoting a positive organizational climate and helping professionals to effectively handle diversity, namely by providing conditions to improve their levels of self-efficacy#FRE#
