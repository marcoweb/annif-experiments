#IRE#Absolute standing feedback has shown greater psychological impact than relative standing feedback. The purpose of this experiment was to examine whether the superior impact of absolute feedback depends on the reward criterion. Participants completed a math test and were randomly assigned to one of the eight conditions in a 2 (reward criterion: absolute vs. relative) × 2 (absolute feedback: high vs. low) × 2 (relative feedback: high vs. low) between-subjects design. The results showed that, regardless of the reward criterion, absolute feedback consistently impacted satisfaction with performance, positive affect, negative affect, and sense of belongingness in math. In contrast, relative feedback only affected satisfaction with performance and sense of belongingness, with smaller effect sizes. Moreover, the effect of relative feedback on satisfaction depended on the reward criterion: Only in the relative (but not absolute) criterion condition, relative feedback impacted satisfaction. These findings were observed after controlling for actual performance and social comparison orientation. In all, the study extends past research and demonstrates that absolute (vs. relative) standing feedback is more impactful regardless of the reward criterion#FRE#
