#ITI#Understanding emotion-regulation strategies among foreign language teachers in response to classroom stressors: Findings from a Q methodology study#FTI#
#IRE#This study presents an analysis of emotion-regulation (ER) strategies used by Thai tertiary-level English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers in response to different classroom stressors. Q methodology—a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative techniques—was employed to identify, characterize, and compare teachers’ divergent viewpoints regarding classroom stressors and corresponding ER strategies. Specifically, a card-sorting task, known as Q sorting, was conducted with a sample of 44 teachers. The data were analyzed using by-person factor analysis to capture shared configurations across the Q sorts. The analysis unveiled three distinct factors, each characterized by a unique combination of stressors and ER strategies. The first group of teachers mitigated the stress arising from poor student performance by seeking social support. The second and third groups used situation modification to manage stress related to self-esteem and student engagement, respectively. While situation modification appeared promising, potentially benefiting both teachers and students, it also carried the risk of escalating teacher stress. The findings provide contextualized insights and a broader understanding of ER strategies among EFL teachers#FRE#
