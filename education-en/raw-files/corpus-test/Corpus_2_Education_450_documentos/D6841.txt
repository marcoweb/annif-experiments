#ITI#Assessing Psychometric Properties of the Sentiments, Attitudes and Concerns about Inclusive Education Scale in a Greek-Speaking Sample of In-service Teachers#FTI#
#IRE#This study aims to assess reliability, construct validity and responsiveness of the Greek version of the revised Sentiments, Attitudes and Concerns about Inclusive Education scale (SACIE-R), Teacher Efficacy for Inclusive Practices (TEIP) and TRS [Individual Capacity to Maintain Motivation and Getting Social Support from Colleagues to Maintain Motivation]. Data were obtained from four hundred sixty-five teachers (employed in typical classes, parallel support or resource rooms) who completed SACIE, TEIP and TRS. The SACIE exhibited excellent reliability (α = 0.88; 95% CI: [0.814 to 0.952]). Exploratory Factor Analysis supported a 2-factor model, explaining 63,984% of total variance. CFA confirmed the proposed 2-factor model and generated satisfactory goodness of fit indices (χ2/df = 1.45 < 2 and p =.000, TLI = 0.984 ≥ 0.95, RMSEA =.004 < 0.08, CFI = 0.98 ≥ 0.90 and SRMR = 0.001 < 0.08). No ceiling or floor effects were observed. SACIE-R, TEIP and TRS showed similar discriminative capacity between groups based on socio-demographic variables. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves of SACIE-R and TEIP indicated good to excellent accuracy. Results suggest that the revised Sentiments, Attitudes and Concerns about Inclusive Education scale is a reliable and valid research tool. SACIE-R and TEIP were largely comparable and equally sensitive. Results are discussed in terms of developing teachers’ educational programs#FRE#
