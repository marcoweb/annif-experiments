#ITI#Performance, Participation and Perception of Computer Education Students Toward Flipped Learning#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this quasi-experimental design study was to investigate and compare flipped learning (FL) and traditional learning (TL), and how FL impacts on student performance, participation and perceptions in higher education in Saudi Arabia. FL as an instructional approach has received much attention as a way to center learning on students in higher education. The significant results of several FL studies were encouraging when examining how it can overcome some of the challenges in higher education relating to students’ performance and participation during lectures. The sample was composed of 84 students enrolled in a computer education course, divided into two groups. The experimental group (n = 43) received FL as a method of instruction and the control group (n = 41) received TL. The data were collected using pre-/post-tests, an observation record, and a five-point Likert scale questionnaire that gathered students’ perceptions of FL. The experimental results show the FL approach, in comparison with the TL, improved the students' participations as students were more active during class and had an overall positive perception of FL. However, no significant differences in students’ performance were found between the groups. The study was limited to its sample, which were female students on one course at one university, so there is a lack of generalization. In spite of the study limitation, the study suggests that FL could be a promising way of encouraging active learning practices and overcoming certain obstacles in learning in higher education such as time shortages and the passive role of students#FRE#
