#IRE#The use of virtual education in teaching has provided a wide range of new educational opportunities; but the combination of ethical and legal risks associated with accessing and exchanging information in the form of ethical issues in the digital space has challenged this type of education. In this regard, in the present study, an attempt has been made to express the faculty members' experiences of ethics in virtual education. The research method was qualitative and based on this, 15 samples were interviewed from two groups of experts in technology and computer science and the field of social and humanities sciences. Content analysis method was used to analyze qualitative data. The results showed that faculty members' perceptions of the issue of ethics in virtual education originates from two approaches: ethical character and ethical security. Also, the results of research related to the ethical issues of using virtual education in higher education by faculty members show that these issues are raised in four dimensions of learning environmental health, cultural dimension, security dimension and identity dimension. In addition, the results show that ethical standards can be placed in three levels of civil liability to students, civil liability as a professional faculty member, and civil liability to the virtual education system. These ethical standards can include ethical issues try to solve them#FRE#
