#ITI#A Pragmatic Approach for Evaluating and Accrediting Digital Competence of Digital Profiles: A Case Study of Entrepreneurs and Remote Workers#FTI#
#IRE#During the last decades, digital competence has become essential at workplace. Nowadays, it is difficult to find a job where no ICT skills are required. At the same time, there is a lack of ecosystems for adult reskilling in digital competence. Moreover, most of them do not use of a common language and terminology, decreasing the possibilities of being used by a wider public. In addition, the assessment of digital competence cannot be done using simple self-assessment tests, but more complex tools such as simulations or other activities based on real scenarios. Considering this, we designed a performance-based evaluation system following a pragmatic approach based on DigComp framework. We carried out a needs analysis based on expert consultation (63 teleworkers and 82 entrepreneurs) to create an assessment syllabus and implement the assessment modules. Then, we conducted an analysis by experts (n = 21) of the relationship between the content of the tests and the construct it was intended to measure. After refinement, the system was piloted by end-users all over Europe (n = 525). Results confirmed that DigComp was the most appropriate reference when considering the transversality of digital competence, providing researchers with well-defined clear criteria#FRE#
