#ITI#Undergraduate Game-Based Student Response Systems (SRSs): A Systematic Review#FTI#
#IRE#Digital game-based learning (DGBL) is becoming a prominent innovative approach used in higher education to gamify the learning experience. Research studies using DGBL as a framework for game design has shown promising results in increasing student engagement, motivation, interaction, satisfaction, and most of all, learning outcomes among undergraduate students in blended and face-to-face learning environments. Although a plethora of digital or online games exists, game-based student response systems, also known as SRSs, were commonly reported in the research literature as an educational technology tool used to engage students into active learning roles. The positive impact of game-based SRSs in traditional classrooms were well documented. However, scant research exists on the effectiveness of game-based SRSs used in distance education courses designed for first-year learners. Therefore, further studies are needed to address this gap in the literature. This review synthesizes the research evidence on the impact of game-based SRSs in terms of (1) enhancing teaching practices, increasing student engagement and motivation, and improving learning outcomes and (2) understanding students’ perceptions regarding their learning experience using game-based SRS as a teaching and learning tool in undergraduate courses in higher education settings. Finally, future recommendations for practice are discussed#FRE#
