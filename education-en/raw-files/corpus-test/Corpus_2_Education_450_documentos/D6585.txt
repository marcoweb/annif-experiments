#ITI#Determinants of cyberbullying perpetration on Facebook among secondary school students in Southern Thailand#FTI#
#IRE#This study examined the common forms of Facebook bullying perpetration and the factors associated with it among secondary school students in southern Thailand. The participants in this study were 600 secondary school students in Pattani province, southern Thailand, ranging in age from 13 to 18. The data were gathered through a questionnaire survey. The associations between the factors and the perpetration of Facebook (FB) bullying were investigated using Chi-squared test. The strength of association between factors and outcome was assessed using multiple logistic regression. The majority of the participants (71.2%) were females, and 51.8% were 15 years or younger. According to the findings, exclusion (28.55%), flaming (24.71%), and cyberstalking (9.16%) were the most common forms of FB bullying. Students having GPA less than 3, students who used FB extensively, spent more than 3 h per day on FB, shared personal information with others, and students who had a high peer attachment were more likely to be FB bullying perpetrators. In conclusion, to prevent cyberbullying, monitoring and supervision of proper internet usage should be implemented, with a focus on academic accomplishment rather than being tied to peers#FRE#
