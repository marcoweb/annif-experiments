#ITI#Identifying the Factors to Enhance Digital Competence of Students at Vocational Training Institutes#FTI#
#IRE#Digital competence is a quite complex and evolving concept, difficult to be defined by using a single definition. The European Digital Competence Framework (DigComp) provides a consistent framework to guide cross-country measurements of digital competence. Even though there are many studies on measuring the digital competence level, there is a limited focus on the factors that may influence each DigComp area. The aim of this study is to examine the factors that affect the different areas of digital competence level of students at Vocational Training Institutes. For the purposes of the study, a set of laboratory tests was developed. The study employs parametric tests—t-test, one-way ANOVA, and Bonferroni correction—to examine those factors. According to the findings: (1) ‘age’ affects the ‘Communication and collaboration’ area of DigComp; (2) ‘educational level’ affects ‘Digital content creation’; (3) ‘specialization’ affects ‘Communication and collaboration’; (4) ‘possession and use of PC’ affects ‘Information and data literacy’, as well as ‘Problem solving’; (5) ‘possession and use of smartphones’ affects ‘Communication and collaboration’; and (6) ‘Internet use’ affects ‘Information and data literacy’. The results suggest that educational institutes should update their curricula to achieve a sufficient level of digital competence for their graduates by developing tailored made courses to reinforce the skills related to those areas separately, and employ educational practices to confront influential factors, such as age and use of technology. Employees’ training processes should also consider updating reskilling and upskilling programs towards improving the five DigComp areas#FRE#
