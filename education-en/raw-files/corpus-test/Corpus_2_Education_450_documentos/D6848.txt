#ITI#Evaluation of a Mobile Web Application for Assessment Feedback#FTI#
#IRE#This paper reports an evaluation of a mobile web application, “MyFeedBack”, that can deliver both feedback and marks on assignments to students from their lecturer. It enables them to use any device anywhere, any time to check on, and receive their feedback. It keeps the feedback private to the individual student. It enables and successfully fosters dialogue about the feedback between the students and the educator. Feedback and marks were already being delivered using the institution’s learning environment/management system “Moodle”. The study used a sequential explanatory mixed-method approach. Two hundred thirty-nine (239) participants were reported on their experiences of receiving feedback and divided among several groups: (a) feedback delivered in “Moodle”, (b) formative feedback in “MyFeedBack”, and (c) summative feedback in “MyFeedBack”. Overall, results showed a statistically significant more positive attitude towards “MyFeedBack” than “Moodle”, with the summative assessment subgroup being more positive than the formative subgroup. There was an unprecedented increase in communication and feedback dialogue between the lecturer and the students. Qualitative results enriched and complemented the findings. The paper provides guidelines for an enabling technology for assessment feedback. These offer insight into the extent to which any of the new apps and functionalities that have become available since this study might likely be favourably viewed by learners and help achieve the desired pedagogical outcomes. These include: (1) accessible using any device, making feedback accessible anywhere, anytime; (2) display feedback first (before the grade/mark); (3) enable personalisation of group feedback by the teacher; (4) provide privacy for each student; (5) facilitate dialogue and communication about the feedback; and (6) include a monitoring feature. Three goals already put forward in the literature—(1) making the feedback feel more personal, (2) getting a quicker turnround by making it easier for the teachers to achieve this, and (3) prompting more dialogue between the educators and students—are advanced by this study which shows how they can be supported by software, and that when they are achieved then users strongly approve them#FRE#
