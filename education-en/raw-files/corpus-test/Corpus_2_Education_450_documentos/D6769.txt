#ITI#Teaching CALL to Pre-service Teachers of English in a Flipped Classroom#FTI#
#IRE#With the emergence of online tools in education, the search for the new models and approaches has gained importance. Flipped Classroom Model (FCM), in which online and face-to-face instructions are blended and the place of homework and classroom instruction is reversed, is one of the recent models. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perceptions of pre-service teachers of English in Turkey context on FCM and an LMS platform, Google Classroom. The participants of this study were 58 pre-service teachers of English enrolled at a state-run university in Turkey. The findings revealed that the pre-service teachers’ perceptions on FCM were quite positive in terms of motivation, effectiveness, engagement and overall student satisfaction. It was also found that they believed that more time was required to prepare before the class, being prepared was something positive in terms of motivation, each learner had to chance to learn on his/her own pace and learning by doing was encouraged through more practice. As for the platform, Google Classroom was found to be user-friendly, particularly due to its features related to assignment submission and following deadlines. It was also observed that the participants were satisfied with the instructor’s attitude in online platform#FRE#
