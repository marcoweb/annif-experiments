#ITI#A Framework for Classifying Replication Studies in Educational Technologies Research#FTI#
#IRE#Replicating research studies is considered one way of establishing validity and confidence of findings in a field of study. In this paper, we introduce a replication framework for classifying studies conducted in the area of educational technology as a possible guide to conducting and reporting replication studies in the field. The paper includes the benefits as well as challenges of replicating research, and proposes a categorical continuum that might be used to determine the strength of the replication of a study. Examples of replication studies and how they fit the framework are included. Implications for using this framework for conducting studies that are worthy of replication in the field of educational technology are addressed in this paper#FRE#
