#ITI#Supporting inference-making during COVID-19 through individualized scaffolding and feedback: a natural experiment#FTI#
#IRE#The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of the Early Language Comprehension Individualized Instruction (ELCII) program in supporting kindergarteners’ learning of inference-making during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two different cohorts of pre- and in-pandemic students completed the ELCII program, which was designed to teach them how to make inferences. Results suggest that kindergarteners during COVID-19 made slower growth over the course of the intervention compared to their counterparts who completed the intervention before the pandemic. However, when growth rates between the two cohorts were compared accounting for the scaffolding and feedback provided by the ELCII program, the growth rates were similar. These findings suggest that the individualized scaffolding and feedback component of ELCII may have supported kindergarteners’ learning of inference-making during the pandemic#FRE#
