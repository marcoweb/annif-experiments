#ITI#The Idea That Digital Remote Learning Can Happen Anytime, Anywhere in Forced Online Teacher Education is a Myth#FTI#
#IRE#An involuntary international experiment in which the entire student population was switched to digital remote learning due to the measures to stop COVID-19 put the paradigm of "anytime, anywhere learning" to the test. Online survey responses were obtained from 281 preservice primary and subject teachers. Using Structural Equation Modelling, connections were examined by inspection of path coefficients between constructs quality of personal digital technology, satisfaction, health, well-being, motivation, and physical activity. Problems with the quality of personal digital technology had a moderate influence on all constructs except motivation. Satisfaction influenced all constructs, well-being, and health the most. When comparing responses of the bottom and top third students based on the quality of personal digital technology, it was found that students who did not have the appropriate technology and workspace were less satisfied and suffered more. This is reflected in an increased incidence of problems related to health, well-being, and physical activity, along with a decrease in motivation. At least for the technologically deprived, the paradigm of "anytime, anywhere learning" is a myth. The study highlights the need for educational institutions to provide adequate technology and workspaces for all students in order to support their well-being and motivation during remote learning#FRE#
