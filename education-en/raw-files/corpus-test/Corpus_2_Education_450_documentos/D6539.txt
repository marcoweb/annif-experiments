#ITI#Do educational aspirations and expectations matter in improving school achievement?#FTI#
#IRE#The main objective of this paper is to examine the role of students’ aspirations and expectations in affecting school achievement among 7th and 8th grade students in Qatar’s schools. The study draws on data collected in Qatari schools from a randomly selected sample of 841 students and their parents. The findings indicate that students’ educational aspirations have a stronger effect on students’ school performance when compared to students’ educational expectations, even when controlling for demographic factors, school attitude, and parental expectations. This finding directly contributes to the debate in the literature about the relative importance of aspirations and expectations, while also confirming what other studies have suggested- that the meaning and the way in which both aspirations and expectations operate is contextually relative. Context plays a significant role here, and consequently, leaves the debate over what matters more, aspirations or expectations, widely open#FRE#
