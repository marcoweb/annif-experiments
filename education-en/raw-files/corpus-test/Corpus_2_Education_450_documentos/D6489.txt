#ITI#Girls suffer: the prevalence and predicting factors of emotional problems among adolescents during upper secondary school in Norway#FTI#
#IRE#This longitudinal, quantitative survey examined factors predicting 1077 Norwegian adolescents` emotional problems during Upper Secondary School (grades I–III, approximately 16–19 years old) considering the following research question: “To what extent do students in Upper Secondary School experience emotional problems, and how are these problems predicted by gender, academic/social self-concept, coping beliefs, appearance pressure and school stress?”. The mentioned variables were scrutinized through analysis of frequencies, zero order correlations and structural equation modeling. Results verified previous findings that there was an increase in emotional problems for adolescents, especially among girls. Furthermore, the study results indicate that coping beliefs is a crucial factor when it comes to the perception of pressure and stress, and the subsequent development of emotional health problems#FRE#
