#ITI#Results and prospects from the utilization of Educational Robotics in Greek Schools#FTI#
#IRE#Nowadays there is a growing research interest in the developments in the domain of Educational Robotics. The present paper is a systematic review of recently published Greek research pertaining to teaching interventions using robotic devices in order to present: a) a synthesis of the available results and the benefits from the utilization of educational robotics and b) a synthesis of research prospects for the educational utilization of robots. After a systematic online search, 54 relevant articles on Greek research approaches and published in conference proceedings were found and their content was analyzed by level of education (i.e., early childhood, primary, secondary). According to the findings of the published research, Educational Robotics appears to support the development of 21st century skills and can be utilized in teaching various subjects at the three levels of education. The conclusions of the present review could be used as reference for future research#FRE#
