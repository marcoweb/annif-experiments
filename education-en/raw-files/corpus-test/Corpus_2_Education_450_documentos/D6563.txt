#ITI#Shared goals and values in the teaching profession, job satisfaction and motivation to leave the teaching profession: The mediating role of psychological need satisfaction#FTI#
#IRE#This study explored relations between teachers’ perceptions of sharing educational goals and values with their colleagues (shared values), job satisfaction, and motivation to leave the teaching profession. The extent to which these associations were mediated through indicators of psychological need satisfaction (belonging, autonomy, and competence) was also examined. Participants were 1145 Norwegian teachers. SEM analyses showed that shared values were positively associated with all indicators of psychological need satisfaction. Shared values were also indirectly associated with general job satisfaction, mediated through perceived belonging and competence. In turn, job satisfaction was strongly and negatively associated with motivation to leave#FRE#
