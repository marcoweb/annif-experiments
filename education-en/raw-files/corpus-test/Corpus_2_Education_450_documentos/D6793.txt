#ITI#Gamification to Enhance Motivation and Engagement in Blended eLearning for Technical and Vocational Education and Training#FTI#
#IRE#Delivery of blended-mode eLearning programs is challenging due to a range of factors, including motivational and engagement issues. This is more challenging in the context of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), which aims to develop competencies to empower learner to find gainful employment. This study proposes an operational model and gamification design to develop blended eLearning programs, which embed motivational and engagement designs as an effective means of achieving learner success in the TVET context. The motivational design uses a motivational framework with the factors of attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. The engagement design includes behavioural, emotional, and cognitive aspects for enhancing learning. Accordingly, appropriate game dynamics, mechanics, and components are used to gamify a blended eLearning course. This gamification design and operational model could be used as a tool to gamify and deliver the competency-based educational programs, using the blended eLearning approach. The study proposes fifteen game dynamics, relevant mechanics, and appropriate game components. The design utilises structural and content gamification in a sample online course, deploying an open-source learning management system. Furthermore, the study suggests embedding game components at the implementation stage of providing learning opportunities, to motivate and engage learners, thereby achieving the acquisition of expected competencies. The gamified course will be delivered to a selected group of learners in the TVET context to assess the feasibility and viability of this approach in anticipation of the future work#FRE#
