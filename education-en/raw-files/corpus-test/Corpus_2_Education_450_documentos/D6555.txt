#ITI#School diversity models revisited: A plea and first evidence for a domain specific approach#FTI#
#IRE#Existing measures of school diversity models use general (abstract) scales to capture how schools approach ethnic-cultural diversity. We argue that it is important to measure such diversity models in (concrete) domain-specific ways. We first constructed a novel domain-specific scale that asks for teachers’ perceptions of practices associated with three common cultural diversity models (i.e., assimilationism, color-blindness and pluralism) across four concrete domains (i.e., language, religion, curriculum and identity) in the school context. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on the responses of 309 Flemish pre- and in-service teachers, we examined whether domain-specific scales fitted the data better than more general scales. In a final step, we examined whether and how teachers’ perceptions of domain-specific diversity models were differently related to their personal diversity beliefs, diversity knowledge and self-efficacy beliefs for culturally responsive teaching. We found that domain-specific diversity model scales fitted the data better than more general scales. Moreover, we found that these domain-specific scales were related to personal and educational diversity beliefs, multicultural teaching knowledge, and self-efficacy beliefs in expected directions. Highlighting the importance of a domain-specific approach, we did find that the correlations of diversity models with teacher and personal diversity beliefs were sometimes different depending on the domain in which the diversity model was applied. Together, these results highlight that it is important to capture school diversity models in concrete and domain specific ways#FRE#
